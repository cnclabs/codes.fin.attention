item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview publicard was incorporated in the commonwealth of pennsylvania in publicard entered the smart card industry in early  and began to develop solutions for the conditional access  security  payment system and data storage needs of industries utilizing smart card technology 
in and  the company made a series of acquisitions to enhance its position in the smart card industry 
in march  publicard s board of directors the board  together with its management team  determined to integrate its operations and focus on deploying smart card solutions  which facilitate secure access and transactions 
to effect this new business strategy  in march  the board adopted a plan of disposition pursuant to which the company divested its non core operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on the disposition plan 
in july  after evaluating the timing of potential future revenues  publicard s board decided to shift the company s strategic focus 
while the board remained confident in the long term prospects of the smart card business  the timing of public sector and corporate initiatives in wide scale  broadband environments utilizing the company s smart card reader and chip products had become more uncertain 
given the lengthened time horizon  the board did not believe it would be prudent to continue to invest the company s current resources in the ongoing development and marketing of these technologies 
accordingly  the board determined that shareholders interests will be best served by pursuing strategic alliances with one or more companies that have the resources to capitalize more fully on the company s smart card reader and chip related technologies 
in connection with this shift in the company s strategic focus  workforce reductions and other measures were implemented to achieve cost savings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on the repositioning charge associated with this action 
at present  publicard s sole operating activities are conducted through its infineer ltd 
infineer subsidiary  which designs smart card platform solutions for educational and corporate sites 
the company s future plans revolve around an acquisition strategy focused on businesses in areas outside the high technology sector while continuing to support the expansion of the infineer business 
publicard s financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has incurred operating losses and requires additional capital to meet its obligations and accomplish the company s business plan  which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty

during the year ended december   cash  including short term investments  decreased by million to million as of december  operating activities from continuing operations utilized cash of million in and principally consisted of the loss from continuing operations of million and a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of million  offset by non cash charges of million for the repositioning charge  goodwill amortization  stock compensation expense and depreciation 
operating activities from discontinued operations utilized cash of  investing activities provided cash of  in and consisted principally of proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations offset in part by capital expenditures

the company has experienced negative cash flow from operating activities in the past and expects to experience negative cash flow in in addition to funding operating and capital requirements and corporate overhead  future uses of cash include the following the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan  which was frozen in as of december   the actuarial present value of accrued liabilities exceeded the plan assets by approximately million 
the annual contribution to the plan is expected to be approximately million in since the plan is significantly underfunded  the company expects that the annual contribution requirements beyond will continue to be significant 
in april  a consent decree among the company  the united states environmental protection agency epa and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep was entered by the court which resolved all of the united states and padep s claims against the company for recovery of costs incurred in responding to releases of hazardous substances at a facility previously owned and operated by the company 
pursuant to the consent decree  the company will pay a total of million plus interest to the united states and the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
through december   the company has made principal payments aggregating million 
in january  the company and the epa reached an agreement to extend the due date on the remaining unpaid balance 
in return  the epa was granted a security interest in certain assets held in escrow 
the remaining payments totaling million  including interest  will be made to the epa over the next three years and consist of  in   in and  in the company leases certain office space  vehicles and office equipment under operating leases that expire over the next eight years 
minimum payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year are  in   in   in and  thereafter 
the company will need to raise additional capital that may not be available to it 
although management believes that existing cash and short term investments may be sufficient to meet the company s operating and capital requirements at the currently anticipated level through december   additional working capital will be necessary in order to fund the current business plan and to ensure the company is able to fund the pension and environmental obligations 
while the company is actively considering various funding alternatives  it has not secured or entered into any arrangements to obtain additional capital 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms or at all 
if the company cannot raise additional capital to continue its present level of operations it may not be able to meet its obligations  take advantage of future acquisition opportunities or further develop or enhance its product offering  any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company currently has no capacity for commercial debt financing 
should such capacity become available it may be adversely affected in the future by factors such as higher interest rates  inability to borrow without collateral  and continued operating losses 
borrowings may also involve covenants limiting or restricting its operations or future opportunities 
the company also currently fails to meet certain requirements for the continued listing of its common stock on the nasdaq national market national market 
the company is eligible to apply to transfer the listing of its common stock to the nasdaq smallcap market smallcap market 
however  there is no assurance i that the company will remedy the identified deficiencies and continue to meet other national market quantitative or qualitative listing criteria  ii that any application to list its common stock on the smallcap market will be successful and  if successful  that it will continue to meet the smallcap market continued maintenance requirements  iii that any appeal in the event of non compliance of its common stock will be successful or iv that its common stock will not be delisted 
should the company s common stock be delisted  the liquidity of the common stock would be adversely affected 
this could impair the company s ability to raise capital in the future 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of equity securities  the company s stockholder percentage ownership of the common stock will be reduced and stockholders may experience dilution in net book value per share  or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of its commons stockholders 
if the company s liquidity does not improve  it may be unable to continue as a going concern and could be required to seek bankruptcy protection 
such an event may result in the company s common and preferred stock being negatively affected or becoming worthless 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  estimates of reserves for receivables and inventories  valuation of investments and goodwill and pension accounting to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
revenue from product sales are recorded upon shipment of the product 
provisions are recorded for estimated warranty repairs  returns and bad debts at the time the products are shipped 
software license fees are recognized upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
revenue from maintenance and support fees is recognized ratably over the contract period 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that revenue recognition criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s credit worthiness 
the company continually monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that it has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  there is no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
inventories 
inventories are stated at lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a quarterly basis 
inventory in excess of the company s estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are management s estimates related to the company s production schedules  customer demand  possible alternative uses and the ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory 
during  the decision to exit the smart card reader and chip business resulted in a significant inventory realizability adjustment 
while management deems this adjustment to be non recurring  a decrease in future demand for current products could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventories on hand 
valuation of investments 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its minority owned investments for impairment 
this review is based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows and independent market data  if available 
while management believes that the current carrying values of such investments has not been impaired  different assumptions could affect the evaluations 
impairment of goodwill 
the company periodically evaluates acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of the acquired businesses 
future events could cause the conclusion that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
pension obligations 
the determination of obligations and expense for pension benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions are appropriate  differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligation and future expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations 
this new statement requires that all business combinations be accounted for using one method the purchase method  intangible assets be recognized apart from goodwill if they meet certain criteria and disclosure of the primary reasons for a business combination and the allocation of the purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major balance sheet caption 
the provisions of this statement apply to all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this new statement  goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment based on the specific guidance of this statement 
in addition  this statement requires disclosure of information about goodwill and other intangible assets in the years subsequent to their acquisition that was not previously required 
the provisions of this statement are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  however  goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  will be subject immediately to the non amortization and amortization provisions of this statement 
the company will adopt this statement on january  in accordance with this statement  no amortization expense for goodwill will be recorded in future periods 
the company has not determined whether a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded in factors that may affect future results we have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow  we have ongoing funding obligations and we need to raise additional capital that may not be available to us 
we have incurred losses and experienced negative cash flow from operating activities in the past  and we expect to incur losses and experience negative cash flow from operating activities in the foreseeable future 
we incurred losses from continuing operations in  and of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we experienced negative cash flow from continuing operating activities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we also have continuing obligations to fund payments due under the consent decree and an underfunded pension plan 
as of december   we were required to make future aggregate payments of million through april in connection with the consent decree 
consistent with the general practices of environmental enforcement agencies  the consent decree does not eliminate our potential liability for remediation of contamination that had not been known at the time of the settlement 
we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan  which was frozen in as of december   the present value of the accrued benefit liabilities of our pension plan exceeded the plan s assets by approximately million 
in addition to the million we expect to contribute to the plan in  we are obligated to make continued contributions to the plan in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the employee retirement income security act of since the plan is significantly underfunded  the company expects that the annual contribution requirements beyond will continue to be significant 
future contribution levels depend in large measure on the mortality rate of plan participants  discount rate and the expected return on the plan assets 
we will need to raise additional capital that may not be available to us 
although we believe existing cash and short term investments may be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at the currently anticipated level through december   additional working capital will be necessary in order to fund our current business plan and to ensure we are able to fund our pension and environmental obligations 
while we are actively considering various funding alternatives  no arrangement to obtain additional funding has been secured or entered into 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding  on acceptable terms or at all 
if we cannot raise additional capital to continue at our present level of operations we may not be able to meet our obligations  take advantage of future acquisition opportunities or further develop or enhance our product offering  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could lead to our being required to seek bankruptcy protection 
we currently have no capacity for commercial debt financing 
should such capacity become available to us  we may be adversely affected in the future by factors such as higher interest rates  inability to borrow without collateral  and continued operating losses 
borrowings may also involve covenants limiting or restricting our operations or future opportunities 
we face risks associated with acquisitions 
an important element of our new strategic plan involves the acquisition of businesses in areas outside the technology sectors in which we have recently been engaged  so as to diversify our asset base 
acquisitions would require us to invest financial resources and may have a dilutive effect on our earnings or book value per share of common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will consummate any acquisitions in the future  that any financing required for such acquisitions will be available on acceptable terms or at all  or that any past or future acquisitions will not materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our acquisition strategy generally presents a number of significant risks and uncertainties  including the risks that we will not be able to retain the employees or business relationships of the acquired company  we will fail to realize any synergies or other cost reduction objectives expected from the acquisition  we will not be able to integrate the operations  products  personnel and facilities of acquired companies  management s attention will be diverted to pursuing acquisition opportunities and integrating acquired products  technologies or companies and will be distracted from performing its regular responsibilities  we will incur or assume liabilities  including liabilities that are unknown or not fully known to us at the time of the acquisition  and we will enter markets in which we have no direct prior experience 
we cannot assure you that any of the foregoing will not materialize  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our tecsec investment may be impaired or subject to a significant write down in the future 
as of december   the carrying value of our investment in tecsec  a privately held company  was million 
this investment has been accounted for at cost and could be subject to write down in future periods if it is determined that the investment is permanently impaired and not recoverable 
if tecsec is not successful in executing its business plan or in obtaining sufficient capital on acceptable terms or at all  our investment in tecsec could be permanently impaired and subject to a significant write down 
the market s acceptance of our products is uncertain 
demand for  and market acceptance of  our software solutions and products are subject to a high level of uncertainty due to rapidly changing technology  new product introductions and changes in customer requirements and preferences 
the success of our products or any future products depends upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products and technologies to meet customer requirements 
we face the risk that our current and future products will not achieve market acceptance 
our future revenues and earnings depend in large part on the success of these products  and if the benefits are not perceived sufficient or if alternative technologies are more widely accepted  the demand for our solutions may not grow and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on a relatively small number of customers for a majority of our revenues 
we rely on a limited number of customers in our business 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a majority of the revenues in our business 
for the year ended december   one customer represented approximately of the company s sales and of the accounts receivable balance as of december  we generally do not enter into long term supply commitments with our customers 
instead  we bid on a project basis and have supply contracts in place for each project 
significant reductions in sales to any of our largest customers would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable and inventory balances in connection with providing products to our customers 
a customer s inability to pay for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and introduce new products in a timely manner 
the rate of technological change currently affecting the smart card market is particularly rapid compared to other industries 
our ability to anticipate these trends and adapt to new technologies is critical to our success 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of actual sales  new product decisions must anticipate future demand as well as the speed and direction of technological change 
our ability to remain competitive will depend upon our ability to develop in a timely and cost effective manner new and enhanced products at competitive prices 
new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products and lower profit margins 
our success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors  including product selections  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes  effective sales  service and marketing  price  and product performance in the field 
our ability to develop new products also depends upon the success of our research and development efforts 
we may need to devote additional resources to our research and development efforts in the future 
we cannot assure you that funds will be available for these expenditures or that these funds will lead to the development of viable products 
the highly competitive markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
we compete against numerous companies  many of which have greater resources than we do  and we believe that competition is likely to intensify 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting us are the extent to which products support industry standards and are capable of being operated or integrated with other products  technical features and level of security  strength of distribution channels  price  product reputation  reliability  quality  performance and customer support  product features such as adaptability  functionality and ease of use  and competitor reputation  positioning and resources 
we cannot assure you that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  sales  customer support  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base of their products and technologies than our company 
additionally  there can be no assurance that new competitors will not enter our markets 
increased competition would likely result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our primary competition currently comes from companies offering closed environment solutions  including small value electronic cash systems and database management solutions  such as girovend  mars  diebold  cybermark and schlumberger 
many of our current and potential competitors have broader customer relationships that could be leveraged  including relationships with many of our customers 
these companies also have more established customer support and professional services organizations than we do 
in addition  a number of companies with significantly greater resources than we have could attempt to increase their presence by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors  resulting in increased competition 
our long product sales cycles subject us to risk 
our products fall into two categories  those that are standardized and ready to install and use and those that require significant development efforts to implement within the purchasers own systems 
those products requiring significant development efforts tend to be newly developed technologies and software applications that can represent major investments for customers 
we rely on potential customers internal review processes and systems requirements 
the implementation of some of our products involves deliveries of small quantities for pilot programs and significant testing by the customers before firm orders are received for production volumes  or lengthy beta testing of software solutions 
for these more complex products  the sales process may take one year or longer  during which time we may expend significant financial  technical and management resources  without any certainty of a sale 
we may be limited in our use of our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards  subject to review by the internal revenue service  totaling approximately million for federal income tax purposes  approximately million of which will expire at the end of we do not expect to earn any significant taxable income in the next several years  and may not do so until much later 
a federal net operating loss can generally be carried back two or three years and then forward fifteen or twenty years depending on the year in which the loss was incurred  and used to offset taxable income earned by a company and thus reduce its income tax liability 
section of the internal revenue code provides that when a company undergoes an ownership change  that company s use of its net operating losses is limited in each subsequent year 
an ownership change occurs when  as of any testing date  the sum of the increases in ownership of each shareholder that owns five percent or more of the value of a company s stock as compared to that shareholder s lowest percentage ownership during the preceding three year period exceeds fifty percentage points 
for purposes of this rule  certain shareholders who own less than five percent of a company s stock are aggregated and treated as a single five percent shareholder 
we may issue a substantial number of shares of our stock in connection with public and private offerings  acquisitions and other transactions in the future 
in addition  the exercise of outstanding warrants and options to purchase shares of our common stock may require us to issue additional shares of our common stock 
the issuance of a significant number of shares of stock could result in an ownership change 
if we were to experience such an ownership change  we estimate that virtually all of our available federal net operating loss carryforwards could not be used to reduce our taxable income 
the extent of the actual future use of our federal net operating loss carryforwards is subject to inherent uncertainty because it depends on the amount of otherwise taxable income we may earn 
we cannot give any assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use any of our federal net operating loss carryforwards before they would otherwise expire 
our proprietary technology is difficult to protect and may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
we cannot assure you that any of our applications will be approved  that any new patents will be issued  that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that the patents of others will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if our technology or products is determined to infringe upon the rights of others  and we were unable to obtain licenses to use the technology  we could be required to cease using the technology and stop selling the products 
we may not be able to obtain a license in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all 
any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
patent disputes are common in technology related industries 
we cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights action 
as the number of products and competitors in the smart card market grows  the likelihood of infringement claims also increases 
any claim or litigation may be time consuming and costly  cause product shipment delays or require us to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to use our proprietary information and software 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary and intellectual property rights as effectively as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary and intellectual property rights may not be adequate 
there is a risk that our competitors will independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around patents or other intellectual property rights 
the nature of our products subjects us to product liability risks 
our customers may rely on certain of our current products and products in development to prevent unauthorized access to digital content for financial transactions  computer networks  and real property 
a malfunction of or design defect in certain of our products could result in tort or warranty claims 
although we attempt to reduce the risk of exposure from such claims through warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our sales agreements and by maintaining product liability insurance  we cannot assure you that these measures will be effective in limiting our liability for any damages 
any liability for damages resulting from security breaches could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in addition  a well publicized actual or perceived security breach involving our conditional access or security products could adversely affect the market s perception of our products in general  regardless of whether any breach is attributable to our products 
this could result in a decline in demand for our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we may have difficulty retaining or recruiting professionals for our business 
our future success and performance is dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel 
if we fail to meet our operating and financial objectives this may make it more difficult to retain and reward our senior management and key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could materially adversely affect our business 
our business requires experienced software programmers  creative designers and application developers  and our success depends on identifying  hiring  training and retaining such experienced  knowledgeable professionals 
if a significant number of our current employees or any of our senior technical personnel resign  or for other reasons are no longer employed by us  we may be unable to complete or retain existing projects or bid for new projects of similar scope and revenues 
in addition  former employees may compete with us in the future 
even if we retain our current employees  our management must continually recruit talented professionals in order for our business to grow 
furthermore  there is significant competition for employees with the skills required to perform the services we offer 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees in the future to sustain and grow our business  or that we will be successful in motivating and retaining the employees we are able to attract 
if we cannot attract  motivate and retain qualified professionals  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our international operations subject us to risk associated with operating in foreign markets  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
international sales represented approximately of total sales for the year ended december  because we derive a substantial portion of our business outside the united states  we are subject to certain risks associated with operating in foreign markets including the following tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  currency exchange risks  export controls related to encryption technology  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  changes in economic and political conditions  potentially adverse tax consequences  and burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
any of the foregoing could adversely impact the success of our international operations 
we cannot assure you that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
to date  we have not engaged in currency hedging 
we are subject to government regulation 
federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the discharge of chemicals and gases  which have been used in our past assembly processes and may be used in future processes 
moreover  changes in such environmental rules and regulations may require us to invest in capital equipment and implement compliance programs in the future 
any failure by us to comply with environmental rules and regulations  including the discharge of hazardous substances  would subject us to liabilities and would materially adversely affect our operations 
our articles of incorporation and by laws  certain change of control agreements  our rights plan and provisions of pennsylvania law could deter takeover attempts 
blank check preferred stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of these shares without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control 
such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock  and as a result  the issuance of the preferred stock could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
rights plan 
our rights plan entitles the registered holders of rights to purchase shares of our class a preferred stock upon the occurrence of certain events  and may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control 
change of control agreements 
we are a party to change of control agreements  which provide for payments to certain of our directors and executive officers under certain circumstances following a change of control 
since the change of control agreements require large cash payments to be made by any person effecting a change of control  these agreements may discourage takeover attempts 
the change of control agreements provide that  if the services of any person party to a change of control agreement are terminated within three years following a change of control  that individual will be entitled to receive  in a lump sum within days of the termination date  a payment equal to times that individual s average annual compensation for the shorter of the five years preceding the change of control and the period the individual received compensation from us for personal services 
assuming a change of control were to occur at the present time  payments in the following amounts would be required mr 
harry i 
freund of  and mr 
jay s 
goldsmith of  if any such payment  either alone or together with others made in connection with the individual s termination  is considered to be an excess parachute payment under the internal revenue code  the individual will be entitled to receive an additional payment in an amount which  when added to the initial payment  would result in a net benefit to the individual  after giving effect to excise taxes imposed by section of the internal revenue code and income taxes on such additional payment  equal to the initial payment before such additional payment and we would not be able to deduct these initial or additional payments for income tax purposes 
pennsylvania law 
we are a pennsylvania corporation 
anti takeover provisions of pennsylvania law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if such change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our stock price is extremely volatile 
the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the future trading price for our common stock will depend on a number of factors  including continued listing of our common stock on the national market or smallcap market see our stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market below  the volume of activity for our common stock is minimal and therefore a large number of shares placed for sale or purchase could increase its volatility  our ability to effectively manage our business  including our ability to raise capital  variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors  general economic conditions  in particular  the technology service sector  expected or announced relationships with other companies  announcements of technological advances innovations or new products by us or our competitors  patents or other proprietary rights or patent litigation  and product liability or warranty litigation 
we cannot be certain that the market price of our common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are adverse and unrelated to our performance 
our stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
on february   we received notice from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq that our common stock had failed to maintain a minimum closing bid price of over the last consecutive trading days as required by nasdaq marketplace rules 
we received a second notice on february   that our common stock also failed to maintain a market value of public float of million 
the nasdaq had previously suspended the minimum bid price and market value of public float requirements in response to market conditions following the september terrorists attacks 
the nasdaq reinstated these requirements effective january  in accordance with the nasdaq rules  we will be provided calendar days  or until may   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and until may  to regain compliance with the market value of public float requirement 
if at any time before may   the closing bid price of our common stock is at least for a minimum of consecutive trading days  nasdaq will determine if we are in compliance 
however  if we are unable to demonstrate compliance on or before may   nasdaq will provide written notification that our securities will be delisted 
at that time  we may appeal the decision to a nasdaq listing qualification panel 
we are eligible to apply to transfer the listing of our common stock to the smallcap market 
if we choose to make such an application and the application is approved  we will be afforded an additional day grace period to comply with the minimum bid price requirement  which will extend the delisting determination until august  we may also be eligible for an additional day grace period provided that we meet certain smallcap market initial listing criteria 
if we should move to the smallcap market and meet the minimum bid price requirement for consecutive trading days and maintain compliance with all other national market listing requirements  we may be eligible to transfer our listing back to the national market 
if we are unable to meet the national market minimum maintenance requirements during the initial day grace period or if we should move to the smallcap market and be unable to meet the minimum maintenance requirements during the extended grace period  then we would be subject to delisting from the nasdaq system 
in that event  after receiving notification that our securities would be delisted  we may appeal the delisting determination 
we cannot assure you i that we will remedy the identified deficiencies and continue to meet other national market quantitative or qualitative listing criteria  ii that any application to list our common stock on the smallcap market will be successful and  if successful  that we will continue to meet the smallcap market continued maintenance requirements  ii that any appeal in the event of non compliance of our common stock will be successful or iv that our common stock will not be delisted 
should our common stock be delisted  the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected 
this could impair our ability to raise capital in the future 
if we are not successful in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us or at all  we may be required to scale back the scope of our business plan  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  and be unable to fund our pension and environmental obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct operations in the united kingdom and sell products in several different countries 
therefore  our operating results may be impacted by the fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies  especially the british pound  in relation to the us dollar 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities with respect to our foreign currency exposure 
we continually monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and may use financial hedging techniques when appropriate to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
even so  exchange rate fluctuations may still have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily through short term investments 
our investment policy calls for investment in short term  low risk instruments 
as of december   short term investments principally us treasury bills were million 
due to the nature of these investments  any decrease in rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
investment risk as of december   the carrying value of our investment in tecsec  a privately held company  was million 
this investment has been accounted for at cost and could be subject to write downs in future periods if it is determined that the investment is permanently impaired and is not recoverable 
if tecsec is not successful in executing its business plan or in obtaining sufficient capital on acceptable terms or at all  our investment could be permanently impaired and subject to a significant write down
