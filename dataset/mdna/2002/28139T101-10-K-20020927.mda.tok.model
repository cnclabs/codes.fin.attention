seasonality and other factors affecting quarterly results the company s quarterly revenues and income fluctuate primarily as a result of the pattern of student enrollment 
the company experiences a seasonal increase in new enrollment in the fall fiscal year second quarter  which is traditionally when the largest number of new high school graduates begin post secondary education 
some students choose not to attend classes during summer months  although the company s schools encourage year round attendance 
as a result  total student enrollment at the company s schools is highest in the fall quarter and lowest in the summer months fiscal year first quarter 
the company s costs and expenses  however  do not fluctuate as significantly as revenues on a quarterly basis 
the company anticipates that the seasonal pattern in revenues and earnings will continue in the future 
quarterly financial results unaudited the following table sets forth the company s quarterly results for and sept 
summer dec 
fall mar 
winter june spring dollars in thousands  except per share data net revenues income before interest and income taxes income before income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted net revenues income before interest and income taxes income before income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted earnings per share amounts for each quarter are required to be calculated independently and therefore may not equal the amount calculated for the year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flow from operations has been the primary source of financing for capital expenditures and growth 
in december  the company closed the offering for per share 
a total of  shares were sold  including  newly issued shares sold by the company and  shares sold by members of the company s senior management and board of directors 
in the offering  the company received total net proceeds  after deduction of expenses and underwriting discounts payable by the company  of approximately million 
the proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness  fund the acquisition of argosy and for general purposes 
cash flow from operations was million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
the increase of million in cash flow from operations for fiscal is due primarily to the increases in net income and depreciation and amortization 
cash flow from operating and investing activities does not reflect capital expenditures of approximately million  million and million  which are included in accounts payable as of june   and  respectively 
additionally  cash flow from operating and financing activities does not reflect income tax deductions related to the exercise of options of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these deductions do not affect the company s tax provision  the benefit is recorded as additional paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
therefore  the change in the applicable balance sheet accounts accounts payable  property and equipment  accrued liabilities and additional paid in capital does not directly correlate to the corresponding amounts in the accompanying statement of cash flows 
the company had net working capital of approximately  as of june   down from million as of june  the decrease in working capital is due primarily to the classification of borrowings under the revolving credit facility as a current liability and the timing of payments made for capital expenditures 
prior to the offering  the company traditionally had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the classification of such outstanding borrowings was based upon the repayment provisions under the credit agreement and expected usage of the facility 
subsequent to the receipt of the net proceeds of the offering  the company has utilized borrowings only occasionally 
the borrowings were repaid in full subsequent to june  and accordingly were included with current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
purchases of property and equipment included in accounts payable increased approximately million from june  to june  as of june   gross trade accounts receivable increased by million  or  to million from the prior year of million primarily due to acquisitions and the higher enrollment and tuition rates 
argosy receivables of approximately million contributed to this change 
additionally  certain recently acquired schools within the art institutes division have not yet been converted to the quarter system used by most of the art institutes and were in session as of year end 
under the payment terms  these balances would be reduced by the end of the applicable class sessions 
although tuition increases have exceeded corresponding increases in federal financial aid sources  the company has arranged for alternative financing sources to manage its credit risk 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
this represents increases of  and in the allowance for doubtful accounts for and  respectively 
the company determines its reserve for accounts receivable by categorizing gross receivables based upon the enrollment status of the student in school  out of school  summer leave of absence  and balances in collection  then establishing a reserve based on the likelihood of collection in school receivables being the lowest percent reserved 
the company provides for extended payment terms beyond graduation generally six months 
as more students have utilized this option  the out of school category has increased as a percentage of gross receivables  which has resulted in an increase in the corresponding allowance against these balances 
therefore  the change between years in the allowance results from both the overall increase in trade receivables as well as changes in the distribution of gross receivables among the categories 
advanced payments increased approximately million to million at june  increases in enrollment  tuition and monies received in connection with alternative loan programs offered to students  as well as arrangements offering incentives for early tuition payments  have all contributed to this increase 
unearned revenue of approximately and million was included with advanced payments as of june  and  respectively 
the company s credit agreement which was amended and restated effective september   to increase allowable borrowing from million to million and provided the banks with a security interest in certain owned real estate and the stock of certain subsidiaries 
the credit agreement provides the company with the ability to borrow up to million on a revolving basis and million in the form of a term loan and will expire on september  upon the closing of the offering  the term loan commitment was no longer available 
the security interests were released on may  as the company has met certain financial covenants 
certain outstanding letters of credit reduce this facility 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants that  among other matters  require the company to meet specified financial ratios  restrict the repurchase of common stock and limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
as of june   the company had approximately million of borrowing capacity available under the credit agreement 
as of june   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement and the interest rate for borrowings under the credit agreement was at june  the following table describes the company s commitments under various contracts and agreements in thousands total amounts committed payments due by period less than year years years over years line of credit borrowings standby letters of credit mortgage obligation operating leases total commitments the company does not anticipate these letters of credit will be drawn on 
borrowings under the credit agreement are used by the company primarily to fund working capital needs resulting from the seasonal pattern of cash receipts throughout the year 
the level of accounts receivable reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition and fees at the beginning of each academic quarter 
collection of these receivables is heaviest at the start of each academic quarter 
capital expenditures capital expenditures made during the three years ended june  reflect the implementation of the company s initiatives emphasizing the addition of new schools and education programs  investment in classroom technology and the acquisition of argosy 
the company s capital expenditures on an accrual basis were million  million and million  for  and  respectively 
included in the company s fiscal capital expenditures was approximately million for argosy 
the company expects that total capital spending for will increase slightly as a percentage of net revenues  as compared to the company anticipates that these expenditures will be financed primarily through cash flow from operations and cash on hand  supplemented as needed with borrowings under the credit agreement 
the anticipated expenditures relate principally to the investment in schools acquired or started during the previous several years and to be added in  continued expansion and improvements to current facilities  new culinary arts programs  additional or replacement school and housing facilities and classroom and administrative technology 
the company leases the majority of its facilities 
future commitments on existing leases will be paid from cash provided by operating activities 
regulations the company indirectly derived approximately  and of its net revenues from title iv programs in  and  respectively 
us department of education regulations prescribe the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year 
lenders generally provide loan funds in multiple disbursements each academic year 
for first time students in their first academic quarter  the initial loan disbursement is generally received at least days after the commencement of that academic quarter 
otherwise  the first loan disbursement is received  at the earliest  ten days before the commencement of the student s academic quarter 
us department of education regulations require title iv program funds received by the company s schools in excess of the tuition and fees owed by the relevant students at that time to be  with these students permission  maintained and classified as restricted until they are billed for the portion of their education program related to those funds 
funds transferred through electronic funds transfer programs are held in a separate cash account and released when certain conditions are satisfied 
these restrictions have not significantly affected the company s ability to fund daily operations 
education institutions participating in title iv programs must satisfy a series of specific standards of financial responsibility 
the us department of education has adopted standards to determine an institution s financial responsibility to participate in title iv programs 
the regulations establish three ratios i the equity ratio  intended to measure an institution s capital resources  ability to borrow and financial viability  ii the primary reserve ratio  intended to measure an institution s ability to support current operations from expendable resources  and iii the net income ratio  intended to measure an institution s profitability 
each ratio is calculated separately  based on the figures in the institution s most recent annual audited financial statements  and then weighted and combined to arrive at a single composite score 
such composite score must be at least for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight 
regulations promulgated under the hea also require all proprietary education institutions to comply with the rule  which prohibits participating schools from deriving or more of total revenue from title iv programs in any year 
if an institution fails to meet any of these requirements  it may be deemed to be not financially responsible by the us department of education  or otherwise ineligible to participate in title iv programs 
the company believes that all of its participating schools met these requirements as of june  critical accounting policies in preparing the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  judgements and estimates are made about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
as part of the financial reporting process  the company s management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base judgements and develop estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
historical experience and available information are used to make these judgements and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in the financial statements 
in addition to the significant accounting policies described in note of the consolidated financial statements  the company believes that the following discussion addresses its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition and receivables the company s net revenues consist of tuition and fees  student housing charges and bookstore and restaurant sales 
the company derived   and of its net revenues from tuition and fees paid by  or on behalf of  its students in  and  respectively 
net revenues are reduced for student refunds and scholarships 
bookstore and restaurant revenue is recognized when the sale occurs 
advance payments represent that portion of payments received but not earned and are reflected as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these payments are typically related to future academic periods and are for the most part  refundable 
the company bills tuition and housing revenues at the beginning of an academic term and recognizes the revenue on a pro rata basis over the term of instruction or occupancy 
for most art institute programs  the academic and fiscal quarters are the same  therefore  unearned revenue is not significant at the end of a fiscal quarter 
however  certain recently acquired schools have programs with class starting and ending dates that differ from the company s fiscal quarters 
therefore  at the end of the fiscal quarter  the company has revenue from these programs that has not yet been earned in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
unearned tuition revenue of approximately million and million  related to programs not on the art institutes quarterly academic calendar  is included with advanced payments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of june  and  respectively

refunds are calculated in accordance with federal  state and accrediting agency standards 
student refunds of approximately million and million were recorded for and  respectively 
the trade receivable balances are comprised of individually insignificant amounts due primarily from students throughout the united states and canada 
the company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by categorizing gross receivables based upon the enrollment status of the student in school  out of school  summer leave of absence and balances in collection and establishing a reserve based on the likelihood of collections in school receivables having the lowest percentage reserved 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include economic conditions or operating performance 
the company s evaluation is based upon assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the company would recognize an impairment loss 
the company continually applies its best judgement when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
the company evaluates the recoverability of the goodwill attributable to each reporting unit as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the company continually applies its best judgement when performing these evaluations to determine the financial projections used to assess the fair value of each reporting unit
