as these investments are of a short term nature and are held until maturity  if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately  there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments 
in addition  changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on interest income 
most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies  limiting the company s exposure to changes in currency rates 
the company periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at september  were not material to the company s results of operations or its financial position
