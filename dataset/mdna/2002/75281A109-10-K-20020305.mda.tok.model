item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capitalized terms herein are defined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company analyzes its estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products and services in the period delivered 
revenues at ipf are recognized as received 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific receivables we judge unlikely to be collected 
at ipf  all receivables are evaluated quarterly and provisions for uncollectible amounts are established 
oil and gas properties are accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting and are periodically evaluated for possible impairment 
the company records a write down of marketable securities when the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary 
impairments are recorded when management believes that a property s net book value is not recoverable based on current estimates of expected future cash flows 
the company s deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities at year end  before considering the effects of other comprehensive income oci 
in determining deferred tax liabilities  accounting rules require oci to be considered  even though such income loss has not yet been earned 
the inclusion of oci causes the deferred tax liabilities to exceed the deferred tax assets by million  therefore  such amount is recorded as deferred tax liability at year end and is included on the balance sheet of the company 
no statutory taxes are included on the income statement as the company has not yet earned income sufficient to cause the deferred tax liabilities to exceed the deferred tax assets 
the company needs to earn approximately million of pre tax income from the unrealized hedges included in oci at year end before statutory taxes will be recorded on the income statement 
due to the complexity of the accounting rules regarding statutory taxes  the timing of when the company will record statutory taxes  which will be deferred  is uncertain 
factors affecting financial condition and liquidity liquidity and capital resources during  the company spent million on development  exploration and acquisitions 
debt including trust preferred and preferred were reduced by a total of million 
at december   the company had million in cash  total assets of million and a debt including trust preferred to capitalization including debt  deferred taxes and stockholders equity ratio of 
available borrowing capacity on the company s bank lines at december  was million on the parent facility  million on the great lakes facility and million on the ipf facility 
long term debt including trust preferred at december  totaled million and included million of borrowings under the parent facility  million under the non recourse great lakes facility  million under the non recourse ipf facility  million of senior subordinated notes  million of convertible subordinated debentures and million of trust preferred 
during  million shares of common stock were exchanged for million of trust preferred  million of senior subordinated notes and million of debentures 
in addition  million of debentures  million of senior subordinated notes and  of trust preferred were repurchased 
a million extraordinary gain net of costs was recorded as the securities were retired at a discount 
in addition   shares of common stock were exchanged for million of the preferred and the remaining were repurchased for  since  there have been million shares of common stock exchanged for million face value of debt and convertible preferred stock 
the company believes its capital resources are adequate to meet its requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business 
there can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain planned capital expenditures 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than after year years years total long term debt    non cancelable operating lease obligations   total contractual cash obligations    due at termination dates in each of the company s credit facilities  which the company expects to renew  but there is no assurance that can be accomplished 
total long term debt including trust preferred at december   was million 
long term debt of million was at floating interest rates 
included in long term debt was million of debt securities which have fixed interest charges

cash flow the company s principal sources of cash are operating cash flow and bank borrowings 
the company s cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices 
the company has entered into hedging agreements covering approximately    and of its anticipated production from proved reserves on an mcfe basis for   and  respectively 
decreases in prices and lower production at certain properties reduced cash flow sharply in and early and resulted in the reduction of the company s borrowing base 
simultaneously  the company sharply reduced its development and exploration spending 
while the million of capital expenditures for were funded entirely with internal cash flow  the amount expended was not sufficient to replace production 
the capital budget of million is expected to increase production or more and expand the reserve base by more than replacing production 
the company s hedge position is expected to allow the capital program to be funded with internal cash flow even in this low price environment 
however  in such a low price environment  management expects little reduction in long term debt as excess internal cash flow will be limited 
with any further decrease in product prices  it would be unlikely that the company would be able to fund the million capital program entirely from internal cash flow 
the company intends to closely monitor its capital expenditure program and results of operations in  therefore  this current low price environment may negatively affect the amount of capital spending for the year 
net cash provided by operations in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash flow from operations increased as higher prices and lower interest expense more than offset increasing direct operating and general and administrative expenses 
net cash used in provided by investing in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
in  a million source of cash from the formation of great lakes  million in asset sales and million of ipf receipts  more than offset additions to oil and gas properties and ipf investments 
in  million of additions to oil and gas properties  offset by million proceeds from sales of assets and million of ipf repayments were included 
the period included million of additions to oil and gas properties and million of ipf investments  partially offset by million of ipf receipts and million of asset sales 
net cash used in financing in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings 
during  recourse debt increased by million and total debt including trust preferred decreased by million 
the reduction in debt was the result of applying excess cash flow  proceeds from asset sales and from exchanges of common stock 
during  recourse debt decreased by million and total debt including trust preferred decreased by million 
the reduction in debt was the result of applying excess cash flow and proceeds from the sale of assets to debt repayment and exchanges of common stock for fixed income securities 
the amount of trust preferred outstanding decreased million in  million in and million in due primarily to exchanges of such securities into common stock 
capital requirements during  million of capital was expended  primarily on development projects 
this represented approximately of internal cash flow 
the company manages its capital budget with the goal of funding it with internal cash flow 
the capital budget of million is expected to increase production or more and expand the reserve base by more than replacing production 
the company s hedge position which covers approximately of anticipated production from proved reserves  is expected to allow the capital program to be funded with internal cash flow even in this low price environment 
however  in such a low price environment  management expects little reduction in long term debt as excess internal cash flow will be limited 
with any further decrease in product prices  it would be unlikely that the company would be able to fund the million capital program entirely from internal cash flow 
the company intends to closely monitor the capital expenditure program and results of operations  therefore  this current low price environment may negatively affect the amount of capital spending for the year 
development and exploration activities are highly discretionary  and  for the foreseeable future  management expects such activities to be maintained at levels equal to or below internal cash flow 
see business development and exploration activities 
banking the company maintains three separate revolving credit facilities a million facility at the parent company  a million facility at ipf and a million facility at great lakes 
each facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrower 
the ipf and great lakes facilities are non recourse to range 
as great lakes is owned  half of the borrowings on its facility are consolidated in range s financial statements 
availability under the facilities are subject to borrowing bases set by banks semi annually and in certain other circumstances 
the borrowing bases are dependent on a number of factors  primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows 
redeterminations require approval of of the lenders  increases require unanimous approval 
at march   there was availability under each of the company s facilities 
at the parent  a million borrowing base was in effect of which million was available 
at ipf  a million borrowing base was in effect of which million was available 
at great lakes  half of which is consolidated at range  a million borrowing base was in effect  of which million was available 
hedging oil and gas prices the company regularly enters into hedging agreements to reduce the impact of fluctuations in oil and gas prices on its operations 
the company s current policy  when futures prices justify  is to hedge between and of projected production from existing proved reserves on a rolling twelve to eighteen month basis 
at december   hedges were in place covering bcf of gas at prices averaging per mcf and  barrels of oil averaging per barrel 
their fair value  excluding hedge contracts with enron north america corp 
enron represented by the estimated amount that would be realized on termination  based on contract versus nymex prices  approximate a net unrealized pre tax gain of million million gain net of million of deferred taxes at december   respectively 
the contracts expire monthly through december and cover approximately of anticipated production from proceed reserves and of production from proved reserves and lesser amounts of and production 
gains or losses on open and closed hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price  generally closing prices on the nymex 
transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold 
any ineffective portion of such hedges is recognized in earnings as it occurs 
net pre tax losses relating to these derivatives in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
over the last three years  the company has recorded cumulative net pre tax hedging losses of million in income  which  when combined with the million unrealized pre tax gain at year end  result in a cumulative net loss of million 
effective january   the unrealized gains losses on these hedging positions are recorded at an estimate of fair value which the company bases on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  on the company s balance as oci  a component of stockholders equity 
the company had hedge agreements with enron for  mmbtu s per day  at per mmbtu for the first three months of amounts due from enron are not included in the open hedges described in the previous paragraph 
based on its accountants guidance  the company has recorded an allowance for bad debts at year end of million  offset by a  ineffective gain included in income and million gain included in oci at year end related to these amounts due from enron 
the gain included in oci at year end will be included in income in the first quarter of the last of the enron contracts will expire as of march while an allowance for bad debts for the entire estimated fair value of these hedge contracts with enron has been recorded  the company is aware of some market offers for purchasing these contracts at percentages much less than par 
interest rates at december   range had million of debt including trust preferred outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
senior debt and non recourse debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  which averaged at year end  excluding interest rate swaps 
at december   great lakes had million of interest rate swap agreements  of which is consolidated at range 
two agreements totaling million at rates of each expire in may two agreements of million each at in december and five agreements totaling million at rates of     and expire in june the agreements expiring in may may be terminated at the counter party s option in may the day libor rate on december  was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost the company approximately million in additional annual interest  net of swaps 
capital restructuring program as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company took a number of steps beginning in to strengthen its financial position 
these steps included the sale of assets and the exchange of common stock for fixed income securities 
these initiatives have helped reduce parent company bank debt to million and total debt including trust preferred to million at december  while the company believes its financial position has stabilized  management believes debt remains too high 
to return to its historical posture of consistent profitability and growth  the company believes it should further reduce debt 
the company currently believes it has sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet its obligations for the next twelve months  however  a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves would reduce the company s ability to fund capital expenditures and meet its financial obligations 
inflation and changes in prices the company s revenues  the value of its assets  its ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
during  the company received an average of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas after hedging 
although certain of the company s costs and expenses are affected by the general inflation  inflation does not normally have a significant effect on the company 
however  industry specific inflationary pressures built up over an month period in and due to favorable conditions in the industry 
while product prices have recently declined  the cost of services in the oil and gas industry have not declined by the same percentage 
any increases in product prices could cause inflationary pressures specific to the industry to also increase 
results of operations the following table identifies certain items included in the company s results of operations and is presented to assist in comparison of the last three years 
the table should be read in conjunction with the following discussions of results of operations 
year ended december  in thousands increase decrease in revenues writedown of marketable securities  enron bad debt expense  loss gain from asset sales  effect of sfas  hedging gains losses    adjustment of ipf valuation allowance  gain on sale great lakes  increase decrease in expenses provision for impairment   extraordinary items gain on retirement of securities    comparison of to net income for the twelve months totaled million compared to million for the comparable period in the twelve month period of included a million gain on retirement of securities versus million in the fourth quarter of included an impairment charge of million 
production increased to mmcfe per day  a increase from the prior year period 
revenues benefited from a increase in average prices per mcfe to 
the average prices received for oil increased to per barrel and for gas increased to per mcfe 
production expenses increased million to million as a result of higher production and property taxes  increased workover costs and slightly higher labor and services and supplies 
therefore  operating cost per mcfe produced averaged in versus in transportation and processing revenues decreased to million due to the impact of the sale of a gas processing plant in june and lower ngl prices 
ipf s million of revenues is a decline of from the same period of in  a favorable adjustment of million was recorded to ipf reserves 
ipf records income from payments on accounts with no reserve accrued against them 
for accounts with reserves accrued  ipf reduces the carrying value of the account for payments received and does not record any income from those collections 
due to declining prices in  less income was recorded from payments received 
in  a favorable adjustment to ipf reserves of million  due to favorable prices at the time  was more than offset by a year end increase in reserve for doubtful accounts of million 
during  ipf expenses included million of administrative costs and million of interest 
during  ipf expenses included million of administrative costs and million on interest costs 
exploration expense increased to million primarily due to additional seismic activity and increased personnel expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased due to additional personnel costs million  higher legal and occupancy costs million and additional costs  incurred by having duplicate functions at great lakes and range 
the average number of general and administrative personnel increased from to the company does not expect further increases of this magnitude 
interest and other income increased from a loss of  in to a gain of  in the period included million of ineffective hedging gains and a  gain on asset sales  partially offset by a million writedown of marketable securities and a million bad debt expense related to the enron hedges 
the period included million loss on asset sales 
interest expense decreased to million primarily as a result of lower average outstanding balances and falling interest rates 
average outstandings on the parent facility were million and million for and  respectively and the average interest rates were and  respectively 
depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a increased to million as a result of the mix of production between depletion pools 
the per mcfe dd a rate in was  a increase from the rate in the dd a rate is determined based on ending reserves valued at prices management believes appropriate and the net book value associated with them and to a lesser extent  depreciation on other assets owned at year end 
the dd a rate in the fourth quarter of was per mcfe as the company s changed its policy and shortened the depreciable lives of other assets owned 
the company currently estimates that the consolidated dd a rate for will approximate per mcfe  a decrease of from the company recorded a provision for impairment on acreage and proved properties for the year ended in evaluating possible impairment  the company generally evaluates acreage on a separate basis from proved properties 
due to its unique nature  west delta was evaluated by considering its proved reserves and prospective value in combination 
acreage 
acreage is assessed periodically to determine whether there has been a decline in value 
if a decline is indicated  an impairment is recognized 
the company compares the carrying value of its properties to the assessment of value that could be recovered from sale  farm out or exploitation 
the company considers other additional information it believes is relevant in evaluating the properties fair value  such as geological assessment of the area  other acreage purchases in the area  timing of the associated drilling program or the properties uniqueness 
the following acreage was impaired for the reasons indicated in thousands reason for impairment acreage pool impairment amount matagorda island probability of drilling reduced based on current assessment of risk and cost  east west cameron condemned portion of leasehold through drilling or geologic assessment offshore other probability of drilling reduced based on current assessment of risk and cost  east texas condemned portion of leasehold through drilling west delta probability of drilling reduced based on current assessment of risk and cost total  proved properties 
the impairment evaluation on all proved properties utilized proved reserves and for west delta only  also included possible and probable reserves 
probable reserves are reserves not reasonably certain or proved  yet more likely to be recovered than not 
possible reserves are reasonably possible but less likely to be recovered than not 
estimated future cash flows include revenues from anticipated oil and natural gas production  severance taxes  direct operating expenses and capital costs 
in assessing the risk associated with proved properties  the company considers historical operations and the risk associated with recoverability of proved reserves 
the risk assessment for west delta also included the recoverability of probable and possible reserves 
properties in the gulf coast region have relatively short reserve lives as production usually declines rapidly 
in evaluating the future cash flows on these properties for impairment  the company used unescalated nymex based prices for oil of per bbl and per mmbtu for gas 
such prices are consistent with those used in note to the financial statements  unaudited supplemental reserve information 
the following properties were impaired based upon an analysis of future cash flows in thousands reason for impairment property pool impairment amount matagorda island decline in gas price cost overruns and delays  mobile bay decline in gas price  east west cameron decline in gas price company increased its assessment of risk associated with non producing reserves  offshore other decline in gas price company increased its assessment of risk associated with non producing reserves  gulf coast onshore decline in gas price  west delta decline in oil price delay in developing gas reserves  total  west delta currently produces primarily oil and has been adversely affected by the decline in oil prices 
proved undeveloped and probable and possible reserves are primarily gas and will not be developed until the operator a major oil company completes interpretation of its proprietary seismic 
the company anticipates significant delays in any drilling schedule 
the company s onshore long life properties were evaluated using a year price strip which averaged per bbl of oil and per mmbtu of gas 
no impairment was required for these properties 
comparison of to net income in totaled million  compared to a net loss of million in net income excluding the impact of hedging losses and unusual items would have been million in versus a net loss of million in production fell to  mcfe per day  a decrease from a decrease would have been reported if the effect of the great lakes transaction were eliminated 
revenues benefited from a increase in average prices per mcfe to  partially offset by the production decrease 
the average prices received for oil increased to per barrel and for gas increased to per mcf 
production expenses fell to million largely as a result of the great lakes transaction and asset sales 
operating costs per mcfe produced averaged in versus in due to higher production taxes and workovers 
transportation  processing and marketing revenues decreased to million as benefits of higher ngl prices were more than offset by the impact of the sterling gas plant sale in april ipf s million of revenues consisted of the return portion of its royalties and a million net reversal of valuation allowances previously provided 
ipf s income rose over that reported in during  ipf expenses included million of administrative costs and million of interest 
exploration expense increased to million  primarily due to higher dry hole costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million 
the increase was primarily due to lower recoupments from third parties for operations which fell due to the great lakes transaction and the expense of establishing duplicate financial and administrative departments in fort worth 
interest and other income decreased million primarily due to million of losses on sales of assets 
interest expense excluding ipf decreased to million primarily as a result of the lower outstandings  partially offset by higher interest rates 
the average outstanding balance on the bank credit facility fell to million from million in the prior year and the weighted average interest rate rose from to 
depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a decreased as a result of the mix of production by depletion pool and lower production 
the company wide dd a rate rose to per mcfe in compared to in due to lower reserves at year end and the net book value of costs associated with them 
acreage is assessed periodically to determine whether there has been an impairment 
if an impairment is indicated  a loss is recognized 
the company compares the carrying value of its acreage to estimated fair value based on a variety of factors including an assessment of value that could be recovered from sale  farm out  or exploitation  a geological and engineering assessment of the area  other acreage transactions in the vicinity  timing of the associated drilling program and the property s uniqueness 
in the fourth quarter of  the company raised its dd a rate to per mcfe to reflect a decline in proved reserves and the increased book value of properties subject to amortization 
reserves were revised downward in due to the removal of drilling and recompletion locations that  based on perceived risk  will probably not be drilled 
see note to the financial statements 
the dd a rate for was per mcfe 
the company s high dd a rate will make it more difficult to remain profitable if commodity prices fall sharply 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about range s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how range views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
all of range s market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
commodity price risk 
range s major market risk is exposure to oil and gas pricing 
realized pricing is primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american gas production 
oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
the company periodically enters hedging arrangements with respect to oil and gas production of proved reserves 
pursuant to these swaps  range receives a fixed price for its production and pays market prices to the contract counterparty 
this hedging is intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations 
realized gains and losses are generally recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs 
starting in  gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or other comprehensive income oci 
the gains and losses realized as a result of hedging are substantially offset in the cash market when the commodity is delivered 
range does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as of december   range had oil and gas hedges in place covering bcf of gas and  barrels of oil 
their fair value  excluding hedge contracts with enron  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon termination  based on contract versus nymex prices  approximated a net unrealized pre tax gain of million million net of million of deferred taxes at december  these contracts expire monthly through december and cover approximately of anticipated production from proved reserves and of production from proved reserves and lesser amounts of and production 
gains or losses on open and closed hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price  generally closing prices on the nymex 
transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold 
any ineffective portion of such hedges is recognized in earnings as it occurs 
net pre tax losses relating to these derivatives in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
effective january   the unrealized gains losses on these hedging positions were recorded at an estimate of the fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  on the company s balance sheet as oci  a component of stockholders equity 
the company had hedge agreements with enron for  mmbtu s per day  at per mmbtu for the first three months of amounts due from enron are not included in the open hedges described in the previous paragraph 
based on its accountants guidance  the company has recorded an allowance for bad debts at year end of million  offset by a  ineffective gain included in income and million gain included in oci at year end related to these amounts due from enron 
the gain included in oci at year end will be included in income in the first quarter of the last of the enron contracts will expire as of march while an allowance for bad debts for the entire estimated fair value of these hedge contracts with enron has been recorded  the company is aware of some market offers for purchasing these contracts at percentages much less than par 
in  a reduction in oil and gas prices  excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions  would have reduced revenue by million 
if oil and gas future prices at december  had declined by  the unrealized hedging gain at that date would have increased by million 
at december   range had million of debt including trust preferred outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
senior debt and non recourse debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  excluding interest rate swaps  which averaged at that date 
at december   great lakes had interest rate swap agreements totaling million  of which is consolidated with range 
two agreements totaling million at rates of each expire in may two agreements of million each at expire in december and five agreements totaling million at rates of    and expire in june the agreements expiring in may may be terminated at the counterparty s option in may on december   the day libor rate was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding net of amounts fixed through hedging transactions at december  would cost the company approximately million in additional annual interest
