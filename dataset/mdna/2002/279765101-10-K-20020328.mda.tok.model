we have historically financed these activities through private debt placements and the sale of equity instruments to investors 
as a result of our acquisition of fis  our continued focus on growing our corporate customer base  and recent expense reductions  we expect to increase cash provided by operations and continue to be cash flow positive throughout  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
capital expenditures  primarily for computers  office and communications equipment  totaled  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the purchases were required to support our expansion and increased infrastructure 
in december and january  we consummated a private sale of common stock and warrants to certain institutional investors 
pursuant to these transactions  we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock  at a purchase price of per share  along with four year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share resulting in gross proceeds of  at december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of  we raised an additional million in january we believe that our existing capital resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be reduced 
in connection with our acquisition of fis  we issued  in promissory notes to the former owners of fis fis notes 
the fis notes were originally scheduled to mature on october  in march  we concluded negotiations to extend the maturity date of the fis notes 
based on these negotiations  holders of  in principal amount of fis notes agreed to amend and restate their notes to provide for  among other things  the following schedule of principal payments  on april    on april  and  on january  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy these revised debt repayment terms  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely effect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be reduced 
our future contractual obligations at december  were as follows and thereafter notes payable and interest    operating leases restructuring costs the company intends to fund these obligations from its cash on hand at december   as well as through future operating cash flows and our private placement completed in january critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the determination of restructuring obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business practices and corporate policies  contractual provisions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments and for sales allowances 
if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate or there are specific factors resulting from the specific type of product or customer class inability to make payments  additional allowances will be required 
we recognized restructuring obligations for involuntary termination benefits  which resulted from actions which were implemented during the year ended december  the severance benefits associated with the individuals was based on the employees terminated  or expected to be terminated  and the estimated severance benefits which we are obligated to pay based on corporate policy 
if certain employees are not involuntarily terminated  or severance amounts are modified  adjustments to the established restructuring obligation may be required 
we recognized facility closing costs equal to the gross obligations payable under existing contractual terms from the closing of our kirkland  wa office in august if the company is unable to realize the expected sublease income from the existing sublease arrangement  the net accrued facility closing costs may require adjustment 
we establish the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets based on a number of factors  which is in part based on our assessments of the technology and customer relationships acquired 
if these estimates change  the estimated useful lives of our intangibles may require adjustment 
we have reduced our deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in so doing  we have estimated future taxable losses in determining the valuation allowance 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations we are exposed to market risk primarily through our investments in available for sale investments 
our policy calls for investment in short term  low risk investments 
as of december   we had no available for sale investments and as a result  any decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
currency rate fluctuations our results of operations  financial position and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies to the us dollar 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure
