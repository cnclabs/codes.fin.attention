references contained herein to jni  the company  we  our and us refer to jni corporation 
overview we are a leading designer and supplier of enterprise storage connectivity products  including fibre channel and infiniband products that connect servers and data storage devices 
we currently market and sell a broad range of fibre channel host bus adapters that connect servers to storage subsystems to facilitate the integration and management of devices used in storage area networks  or sans 
we also design and market high performance application specific integrated circuits  or asics  based on our proprietary fibre channel technology 
we recently released our first infiniband products  called host channel adapter modules  that allow stand alone servers to cluster with infiniband connectivity operating at gb or gb per port 
we are currently developing or designing products that will bridge infiniband to other storage protocols  such as fibre channel and iscsi 
revenues are comprised principally of sales of our host bus adapter products 
additionally  sales of our asics and revenue received from our asic development agreements  which represented less than five percent of total revenues for the year ended december   are also included in revenues 
cost of revenues is comprised principally of payments to our contract manufacturers  costs of components  material expediting charges  final assembly costs  manufacturing and quality related costs  inventory management costs  warranty and support costs 
we expect our gross margin to be affected by many factors  including changes in average unit selling price  fluctuations in demand for our products  the mix of products sold  the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  the timing and size of customer orders  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  changes in costs of components  and new product introductions both by us and our competitors 
we reserve for warranty claims at the time of sale based on historical experience 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for engineering personnel  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  depreciation of development and test equipment  prototyping expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our products and the cost of computer support services 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  public relations  advertising  promotional and trade show costs and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in finance  human resources  information technology  administrative activities and legal and accounting fees 
amortization of intangible assets is attributed to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the purchase of products and technology from adaptec 
as a result of the consideration paid to adaptec  we recorded million in intangible assets related to the core technology acquired  which was amortized over an estimated useful life of three years 
amortization of this amount was completed during the year ended december  amortization of stock based compensation relates to deferred compensation recorded in connection with the grant of stock options to employees in all operating expense categories where the option exercise price was less than the fair value of the underlying shares of common stock as determined for financial reporting purposes 
we have recorded million of deferred compensation within stockholders equity  which is being amortized over the vesting period of the related stock options  generally four years 
the amortization of stock based compensation will be completed in recent developments in january  we acquired an exclusive license to troika networks fibre channel software and hardware products that provide high availability san solutions for enterprise class servers running under windows nt  windows and solaris operating systems 
the purchase price included an initial payment of million and contingent consideration of million 
the million consideration includes payment for the software license  research and development services  transition services and a covenant not to compete 
the million contingent payment may be due if we reach certain revenue or unit sales levels and upon completion of certain oem certification requirements 
additionally  if we attain certain revenue or unit sales levels of the related products  we will be obligated to make royalty payments based on revenue for one year from the royalty payment start date or until june   whichever occurs earlier 
to the extent that we do not achieve certain revenue or unit levels by january   troika is obligated to reimburse us for a portion of the initial purchase price  up to million 
we are in the process of evaluating the accounting treatment for this transaction  and an independent valuation of the transaction is being performed for accounting purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment revenue recognition  accounting for marketable securities  inventory valuation and related reserves  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we sell our products domestically and internationally primarily through oem and distribution channel customers including distributors  system integrators and value added resellers who sell directly to end users 
our significant customers include leading storage solution providers  server oems and storage oems 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment except for sales to distributor customers that have contractual rights of return 
revenue from sales to distributors that have contractual rights of return is recognized when these distributors ship our products to their end user customers based on reports that we receive from such distributors 
allowances for estimated sales returns are provided at the time revenue is recognized 
we reserve for uncollectible accounts and product returns based on our historical experience and expected future returns related to products shipped 
revenue from our asic development agreements is generally recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs at completion 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors and major oems are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our products sold are generally covered by a warranty of three years for our adapter products and a one year warranty for our asics 
we accrue a warranty reserve for the estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
accounting for marketable securities 
we classify our investments in marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recognized upon the sale of our marketable securities in our statements of operations 
our investments in marketable securities are managed and held in the custody of three domestic financial institutions 
we have established investment policy guidelines that we have provided to each of these financial institutions 
based on our guidelines  our investments generally consist of fixed and variable a or higher graded us government  state and local  and corporate debt obligations with maturities ranging from one to twenty four months 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the fair market value of our investments in marketable securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
additionally  the amount of interest income that we earn on our investments may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
as of december   our marketable securities available  which consisted of  in short term investments and  in long term investments  represented of our total assets 
inventory valuation and related reserves 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
we use a standard cost system for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
we write down or reserve for estimated obsolete or excess inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we compare current inventory levels on a product basis to our current sales forecast in order to assess our inventory reserve balance 
our sales forecasts are based on economic conditions and trends both current and projected  anticipated customer demand and acceptance of our products  current products  expected future products and various other assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an excess inventory charge of million based on the anticipated demand for our gigabit products 
we increased our gigabit products and associated component inventory levels during the fourth quarter of in anticipation of continued strong sales momentum for these products which did not materialize 
additionally  information technology spending continued to slow down also contributing to the excess inventory charge 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and research and development tax credits  before they expire 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
comparison of years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease was due to a million decrease in sales of our sbus host bus adapter products and a million decrease in sales of our pci host bus adapter products partially offset by a million increase in sales of our asics and revenue received under asic development agreements 
the total revenue recognized under research and development agreements for the year ended december  was million as compared to no revenues in the overall decrease in revenues for the year ended december  is primarily a result of the slowdown in information technology spending in coupled with weakness in the solaris market  which is the principal market for our products 
additionally  the decrease in sbus sales resulted from the transition of our solaris based products from the sbus to the pci interface 
the decline in net revenues is also attributable to a decrease in the average selling price for our host bus adapters primarily as a result of continued pricing pressure and discounts provided to our major oem partners as well as the transition to pci products which have lower average selling prices than sbus products 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of net revenues in compared to of net revenues in as our dependency on sbus continues to decline  we expect an increasing percentage of our net revenues will be from sales of our pci products  including solaris  windows nt  windows and other operating systems 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributed to a million charge recorded for excess inventory 
in the second quarter of  we recorded an excess inventory charge of million against cost of revenues based on the determination that current inventory levels were in excess of projected future demand 
excluding the million excess inventory charge  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  the allocation of fixed manufacturing costs over a lower revenue base also contributed to the decrease in gross margins 
additionally  the decrease in the average selling price for our host bus adapters contributed to the decline in gross margins 
we expect our gross margin to continue to decline as we continue to experience pricing pressure on host bus adapter products and to generate an increasing percentage of sales from our pci based products which carry a lower gross margin than our sbus products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to higher personnel costs  resulting from an increase in the number of personnel needed in order to staff a higher level of research and development  and higher depreciation expense  resulting from an increase in capital expenditures necessary to expand our research and development efforts and continued investments in our system integration lab 
the increase in office and lab space for our research and development team resulted in higher rent and occupancy related expenses 
additionally  we opened up an office for a research and development team in singapore in january of to assist in the design and development of our asics which also contributed to the increase in research and development expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues 
although we will continue to invest significant resources in our research development efforts  including both our fibre channel and infiniband development  we anticipate that research and development expenses will decrease in absolute dollars in due to a headcount reduction in the first quarter of and a planned decrease in consulting expenses 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in selling and marketing expenses was due primarily to an increase in personnel costs  an increase in business development and marketing programs  an increase in travel expenses by our sales people  an increase in public relations expenses and reproduction and printing costs as we continued our efforts to increase our brand awareness and increased costs associated with opening new sales offices in the united states and europe  partially offset by a decrease in sales commissions due to the decrease in net revenues 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will decrease in absolute dollars in due to a headcount reduction in the first quarter of and cost improvement measures in discretionary spending  such as advertising  trade shows  public relations and recruiting expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs arising from costs associated with changes in senior management  an increase in legal fees mainly as a result of the class action lawsuit filed in april and an increase in insurance and consulting expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease in absolute dollars in due to a headcount reduction in the first quarter of and an expected decrease in legal and consulting expenses 
amortization of intangible assets 
we amortized million of intangible assets during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease relates to the balance being fully amortized during the year ended december  the intangible assets related to additional consideration we issued to adaptec in the third quarter of for fibre channel technology we acquired from adaptec in november interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  interest income for the year ended december  primarily represents interest earned on our investments in marketable securities resulting from the proceeds from our public offering completed in october interest income for the year ended december   primarily represents interest earned on our investments in marketable securities resulting from the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in october income tax provision benefit 
we recognized an income tax provision of during the year ended december  as a result of the taxable loss during the fiscal year the difference between our effective tax rate of and the statutory tax rate is primarily a result of the net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we recognized an income tax provision of million  with an effective tax rate of  during the year ended december  as a result of the taxable income generated in the year ended december  the difference between our effective tax rate of and the statutory tax rate is primarily a result of research and development tax credits generated

comparison of years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was due to an increase in sales of sbus and pci host bus adapter products with a million increase in sbus sales and a million increase in pci sales  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our asics 
the increase in revenues was attributable to increased demand for our products and growth in the market for fibre channel products 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of net revenues in compared to of net revenues in gross margin 
gross margin increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  the decrease was due to increased sales of our pci host bus adapter products which generally have lower gross margins than our sbus host bus adapter products 
gross margins for the year ended december  also decreased as a result of inventory reserves recorded for slow moving and obsolete inventory and higher prices on certain components due to industry wide shortages 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to higher personnel costs and contracted services  resulting from an increase in the number of personnel needed in order to staff a higher level of research and development  and higher depreciation expense  resulting from an increase in capital expenditures necessary to expand our research and development efforts 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues

selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs arising from the addition of new employees and additional expenses associated with being a public company 
expenses associated with the hiring of a new chief executive officer and vice president of human resources in also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  amortization of intangible assets 
we amortized million of intangible assets during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in amortization expense relates to the significant increase in intangible assets that resulted from the additional consideration we issued to adaptec in the third quarter of for fibre channel technology we acquired from adaptec in november interest income 
interest income of million primarily represents interest earned on our investments in marketable securities during the year ended december   resulting primarily from the proceeds from the initial public offering completed in october interest income of  in primarily represents interest earned in november and december on our investments in marketable securities  resulting from the proceeds from our initial public offering completed at the end of october interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  represents interest associated with our intercompany revolver borrowings from jaycor 
subsequent to our initial public offering  we repaid the outstanding balance to jaycor in full 
accordingly  we had no interest expense in the year ended december  income tax provision benefit 
we recognized an income tax provision of million  with an effective tax rate of  during the year ended december  as a result of the taxable income generated in the year ended december  the difference between our effective tax rate of and the statutory tax rate is primarily a result of research and development tax credits generated 
we recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to the expectation that deductions from future employee stock option exercises and related deductions will exceed future taxable income 
we recognized an income tax benefit of  in the year ended december  due primarily to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was released during the second quarter of based on management s determination at the time that our ability to realize such a benefit was more likely than not 
this determination was based on our historical operating results  which included the fourth consecutive quarter of pre tax net income before non deductible stock based compensation  and anticipated future operating results 
excluding the effect for the release of the valuation allowance  the tax rate for would have been approximately 
comparison of years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the substantial majority of the increase was due to an increase in sales of sbus host bus adapters 
to a lesser extent  the increase in net revenues was due to an increase in sales of pci host bus adapters 
the increase in revenues also reflects the growth in the market for fibre channel products and the increased market acceptance of our products 
in  our top five customers accounted for of net revenues compared to of net revenues for the top five customers in sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of net revenues in compared to of net revenues in gross margin 
gross margin increased million  or  to million in from million in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues increased to in from in the increase was due to lower component and manufacturing costs and the allocation of fixed manufacturing costs over a greater revenue base

subsequent to our initial public offering  the outstanding balance to jaycor was paid in full 
income tax provision benefit 
we recognized an income tax benefit of  during the year ended december  due primarily to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was released during the second quarter of based on management s determination that it became more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized 
this determination was based on our historical operating results  which included the fourth consecutive quarter of pre tax net income before non deductible stock based compensation  and anticipated future operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to changes in the fair market value of our investments and the amount of interest income earned on our investment portfolio 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair market value of our investments 
however  the fair market value of our investments in marketable securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december
