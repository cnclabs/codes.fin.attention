comparison of fiscal  and net revenues  change change networking products non networking products total net revenues net revenues for decreased by million  or  from net revenues in in contrast  net revenues for were higher than net revenues in by million  or 
networking our networking revenues declined in due to decreased unit sales of our networking products caused by reduced demand for our customers products and excess inventories of our products accumulated by our customers in the prior year 
also included in the decline in networking revenues was a decline in the selling price of our products 
networking revenues were higher than networking revenues in due to an increase in customer demand that resulted from the growth of our customers networking equipment businesses  our customers continued transition from internally developed application specific semiconductors to our standard semiconductors  our introduction and sale of networking products that addressed additional network functions  and a significant increase in our customers inventory of our products 
non networking non networking revenues declined in compared to an increase of in these changes reflect the volume of purchases made by our principal customer in this segment 
in  we discontinued development of follow on products in this segment and we are now only fulfilling customer orders for previously developed products 
gross profit  change change networking products percentage of networking revenues non networking products percentage of non networking revenues total gross profit percentage of net revenues total gross profit for decreased by million  or  from gross profit in in contrast  gross profit was higher than gross profit in by million  or 
networking our networking gross profit decreased by million in over of this dollar decrease was due to the reduction in our networking sales volume 
our networking gross profit as a percentage of networking revenues decreased percentage points from in to in this decrease resulted from the following factors o a million write down of excess inventory which lowered gross profit by percentage points  o a shift in product mix towards lower margin products  which lowered gross profit by percentage points  and o the effect of applying fixed manufacturing costs over reduced shipment volumes which lowered margins by percentage points 
the million write down for excess inventory  which we recorded in cost of revenues  consisted of a million charge in response to the cancellation of certain of our customers programs plus a charge of million for inventory levels in excess of estimated month demand see critical accounting policies and significant estimates 
our networking gross profit increased by million in due to increased sales volumes but did not change as a percentage of networking revenues between and non networking non networking gross profit as a percentage of non networking revenues decreased to in from in and in due to a reduction in the selling price of our non networking product

although we implemented two restructuring plans during the first and fourth quarters of  our total r d expenses increased because we had made substantial additions to our personnel and tools during the latter part of and we have realized less than months savings from our fourth quarter restructuring 
while we reduced our r d personnel by by the end of from the end of  our personnel and related costs for exceeded by approximately million 
we also increased our tools and equipment costs by million due to our continued investment in new tools and equipment in support of our continuing research and development efforts 
our r d expenses also increased by million as a result of acquisitions that we completed during and accounted for under the purchase method 
in  our r d expenditures increased by over due to a million increase in personnel and related costs as a result of internal hiring and acquisitions  and a million increase in service and material costs associated with our expanding product development efforts 
our r d expenses also increased by million as a result of acquisitions that we completed during and accounted for under the purchase method 
our r d expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues in due to the decline in our net revenues 
the expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues in as a result of the growth in our net revenues that year 
marketing  general and administrative expenses our marketing  general and administrative  or mg a  expenses decreased by to million in from million in the million decrease in our mg a expenses was largely due to a million reduction in sales commissions as a result of the decline in our revenues 
mg a expenses increased by approximately million in as a result of the full year impact of acquisitions made during that were accounted for under the purchase method 
through our two restructuring programs in  we reduced our mg a personnel by from the end of the preceding year 
however  due to growth in the latter part of  this reduction in mg a personnel resulted in only a year over year decrease in mg a personnel costs 
recruitment costs decreased in due to less hiring activity 
these savings were offset by increases in the cost of facilities due to the prior year s expansion 
our restructurings resulted in excess space when we reduced our personnel in see restructuring and other special charges 
our mg a spending in increased from in  we increased our personnel and recruitment costs by million and expanded our facilities and related costs by more than million due to the addition of new personnel 
we also increased the size of our direct sales force in and incurred million more in commissions as a result of our increased revenues 
mg a expenses also increased by approximately million in as a result of acquisitions made during that were accounted for under the purchase method 
mg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased in and decreased in because many of our mg a costs are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  these expenses will generally decline as a percentage of revenue in periods of rising revenues and may increase as a percentage of revenue in periods of declining revenues 
amortization of deferred stock compensation we recorded total deferred stock compensation expense of million in compared to million in and million in in  our amortization of deferred stock compensation increased compared to due to accelerated vesting related to certain employees terminated as a result of our two restructurings 
our acquisitions of aanetcom  abrizio  qed  switchon  toucan  and extreme in contributed million to deferred stock compensation amortization in and all of the expense in an additional  million of the expense in related to the unearned compensation recognized on the malleable and datum purchase acquisitions 
amortization of goodwill and impairment of intangibles non cash goodwill charges increased to million in from million in and million in primarily as a result of the goodwill recorded in connection with the malleable and datum acquisitions  which were completed in mid during the second quarter of  we discontinued further development of the technology acquired in the purchase of malleable 
we do not expect to have any future cash flows related to the malleable assets and have no alternative use for the technology 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million  equal to the remaining net book value of goodwill and intangible assets related to malleable 
as a result  there was no remaining malleable goodwill or intangibles to amortize in the second half of in the fourth quarter of  due to a continued decline in current market conditions and a delay in the introduction of certain products to the market  we completed an assessment of the future revenue potential and estimated costs associated with all acquired technologies 
as a result of this review  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the acquired goodwill and intangibles recognized in the purchase of datum 
the impairment charge was calculated by the excess of the carrying value of assets over the present value of estimated future cash flow related to these assets 
the impairment charge reduced the amounts subject to amortization for the remainder of the year 
costs of merger we did not make any pooling acquisitions and therefore  did not incur any merger costs in in  we completed five pooling acquisitions and incurred million of merger costs 
in  we completed one pooling acquisition and incurred million of merger costs 
these charges consist primarily of investment banking and other professional fees 
in process research and development ipr d ipr d charges were million in there were no ipr d charges in or the amounts expensed to in process research and development in arose from the acquisitions of malleable and datum 
we did not make any acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method in or we calculated the charge for ipr d related to malleable and datum by determining the fair value of the existing products as well as the technology that was currently under development using the income approach 
under the income approach  expected future after tax cash flows from each of the projects under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and charges for the use of contributory assets were deducted from estimated revenues to determine estimated after tax cash flows for each project 
these projected future cash flows were further adjusted for the value contributed by any core technology and development efforts expected to be completed post acquisition 
these forecasted cash flows were then discounted based on rates derived from our weighted average cost of capital  weighted average return on assets and venture capital rates of return adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
the risk adjusted discount rates used involved consideration of the characteristics and applications of each product  the inherent uncertainties in achieving technological feasibility  anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
after considering these factors  we determined risk adjusted discount rates of and for malleable and datum  respectively 
in our opinion  the pricing model used for products related to these acquisitions were standard within the high technology industry and the estimated ipr d amounts so determined represented fair value and did not exceed the amounts that a third party would have paid for these projects 
when we acquired these companies  we did not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reduction or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions did not include anticipated cost savings 
a description of the ipr d projects acquired is set forth below the in process technology acquired from malleable was planned to detect incoming voice channels and process them using voice compression algorithms 
the compressed voice was to be converted  using the appropriate protocols  to atm cells or ip packets to achieve higher channel density and support multiple speech compression protocols and different packetization requirements 
at the date of acquisition we estimated that malleable s technology was complete and the costs to complete the project to be million 
the technology acquired from datum is a digitally controlled amplifier architecture  which was designed to increase base station system capacities  while reducing cost  size and power consumption of radio networks 
at the date of acquisition  we estimated that datum s technology was complete and the costs to complete the project to be million 
the above estimates were determined by comparing the time and costs spent to date and the complexity of the technologies achieved to date to the total costs  time and complexities that were expected to be expended to bring the technologies to completion 
progress on the technology acquired from malleable was slower than originally estimated and as a result  costs incurred on this project exceeded our original estimates 
in the second quarter of  we discontinued development of this technology and recorded an impairment charge related to the malleable goodwill and purchased intangible assets see amortization of goodwill and impairment of intangibles 
development of the chip incorporating the technology acquired from datum was completed in the fourth quarter of and the costs incurred to that date were in line with our initial expectations 
since then  we have completed the required firmware related to this chip and have extended development of the datum technology to a follow on product 
the general economic slowdown has delayed the introduction of the third generation base stations into which we expect to incorporate our technology  but we expect these products to begin generating revenues in the second quarter of as a result of the delay in introduction of the third generation base stations  we failed to achieve the revenues  net income  and return on investment expected at the time that the acquisition was completed 
we recorded an impairment charge related to the datum goodwill and purchased intangible assets during the fourth quarter of see amortization of goodwill and impairment of intangibles 
restructuring and other special charges restructuring march  in the first quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan in response to the decline in demand for our networking products and consequently recorded a restructuring charge of million 
prior to the end of the first quarter  management approved the restructuring plan committing pmc to the termination of employees  the consolidation of a number of facilities and the curtailment of certain research and development projects 
employees terminated under this plan were advised prior to the end of the quarter of the termination benefits to which they were entitled 
the elements of the accrued restructuring costs related to the march restructuring plan are as follows total charge noncash cash restructuring liability at in thousands march  charges payments december  workforce reduction    facility lease and contract settlement costs    write down of property and equipment  net   total     workforce reduction includes the cost of severance and related benefits of employees affected by the restructuring 
these terminations were spread across all business functions  with approximately occurring in research and development and the remainder occurring in sales  marketing and administrative and production departments 
facility lease and contract settlement costs include i lease termination payments and other costs related to the closure of certain corporate facilities  sales offices and research and development centers for activities that have been exited or restructured  and ii penalties incurred due to our withdrawal from certain purchase contracts 
certain leasehold improvements located at the closed facilities and computer equipment and software licenses were determined to be impaired as a result of the restructuring activities and were written down to estimated fair market value  net of disposal costs 
we expect to complete the restructuring activities contemplated in the march plan by the end of march upon conclusion of these restructuring activities  we expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately million in cost of revenues and operating expenses 
restructuring october  due to the continued decline in market conditions  we implemented a second restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of to reduce our operating cost structure 
prior to the end of the fourth quarter  management approved the second restructuring plan committing pmc to the termination of employees  the consolidation of additional excess facilities  and the curtailment of additional research and development projects 
employees terminated under this plan were advised prior to the end of the quarter of the termination benefits to which they were entitled 
as a result  we recorded a second restructuring charge of million in our fourth quarter

excluding interest expense and the amortization of debt financing costs  interest and other income for was million as compared to million in the amount for included income of million related to an investee accounted for under the equity method in while our interest income declined by approximately million as a result of a decline of average yields on our cash  short term and long term investments  or cash balances  this decline was offset by an additional million in interest income from an overall increase in our cash balances 
our interest expense increased to million in from million in as a result of the interest expense incurred on convertible notes issued in august see liquidity and capital resources below 
we also incurred an incremental million in amortized debt issuance costs incurred in as a result of the issuance of our convertible notes 
our net interest income increased in compared to as a result of higher cash balances available to earn interest

during the year  we also had an investment in ic works  inc  or icw  a private company that was subsequently purchased by cypress semiconductor  a public company 
as a result of that transaction  we exchanged our preferred shares of icw for common shares of cypress semiconductor 
we disposed of a portion of our shares in cypress semiconductor  resulting in a gain of million 
provision for income taxes 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a recovery of 
excluding the effects of non deductible goodwill  deferred stock compensation amortization  and impairment of purchased intangibles  the effective income tax rate for was a recovery of compared to the statutory tax rate of 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate as a result of a valuation allowance provided on deferred tax assets that were uncertain of being realized 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was an expense of compared to a statutory tax rate of 
our increased effective tax rate primarily reflects the higher provision for income taxes for our canadian subsidiary and the non tax deductible charges for in process research and development  goodwill amortization  deferred stock compensation and acquisition costs related to acquisitions completed during the year 
these factors were partially offset by the utilization of tax losses and other deferred tax assets for which benefits were previously not recognized 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  which approximated the statutory tax rate of 
we have provided a valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability

recently issued accounting standards 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  business combinations and statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of assets acquired  including goodwill and intangibles  and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
sfas requires goodwill to be allocated to  and assessed as part of  a reporting unit 
further  sfas specifies that goodwill will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to impairment tests at least annually 
the impairment test is a two step process 
first  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to identify possible impairment and then  if necessary  the impairment is measured through a deemed purchase price allocation 
under this standard  we will also be required to review the useful lives of acquired goodwill and intangible assets at least annually 
we will adopt sfas and on a prospective basis as of january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows unless we acquire significant additional companies 
in  we will no longer amortize goodwill pursuant to sfas  thereby eliminating annual goodwill amortization of approximately million 
goodwill amortization for the year ended december  was million 
unamortized goodwill as of december  was million 
we will complete an initial goodwill impairment assessment in the second quarter of to determine if a transition impairment charge should be recognized under sfas in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
for the disposal of a business segment 
sfas establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the statement also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include disposals of a component of an entity and provides additional implementation guidance with respect to the classification of assets as held for sale and the calculation of an impairment loss 
we are required to adopt sfas effective january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial statements
