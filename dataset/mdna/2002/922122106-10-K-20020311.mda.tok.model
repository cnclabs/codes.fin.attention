gov for forward and the wall street journal for oil prices remained strong during the first three quarters of  averaging per barrel of west texas intermediate crude during that time period 
while each of the first three quarters of resulted in a sequential decline in the price of west texas intermediate crude  the most significant quarterly decline in oil prices occurred in the fourth quarter which dropped from the average price in the third quarter of natural gas prices in  however  began to decline in the second quarter of off from the first quarter and continued to drop in the third and fourth quarter of the decline in oil and gas prices was the result of a weakening worldwide economy during the second half of the strong oil prices for the majority of led to an increase in rig activity in the us increase and international increase markets 
the improvements in rig activity had a significant impact on the company s results of operations as operating profit excluding merger  transaction  and litigation costs was up in compared to  increasing from million to million 
the increase in activity levels combined with acquisitions in favorably impacted all four of the company s main business segments as revenue was up    and over revenue in the drilling equipment sales  tubular services  drilling services  and coiled tubing wireline products business segments  respectively

accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and other increased by million and income taxes payable increased by million 
the increase in receivables was directly related to a million increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter of days sales outstanding decreased from days at december  to days at december  inventory increased due to an increase in work in process as the december  backlog for the drilling equipment sales segment increased million from december  to december  the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was due to an increase in prepaid insurance  taxes  and deferred costs on drilling equipment projects 
the increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and other was due to increased vendor payables and accruals associated with increased operations and greater accrued interest associated with higher outstanding debt balances

    critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to bad debts and inventory obsolescence  impairments of long lived assets  including goodwill and our reserves for product warranty claims 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable  the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
reserves for bad debts are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
substantially all of our revenues come from international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies and we have receivables in many foreign jurisdictions 
if  due to changes in worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions  our customers were unable to repay these receivables  additional allowances would be required 
reserves for inventory obsolescence are determined based on our historical usage of inventory on hand as well as our future expectations related to our substantial installed base and the development of new products 
changes in worldwide oil and gas drilling activity and the development of new technologies associated with the drilling industry could require additional allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value 
accruals for warranty claims are provided based on historical experience at the time of sale 
product warranties generally cover periods from one to three years 
our accruals for warranty claims are affected by the size of our installed base of products currently under warranty  as well as new products delivered to the market 
periodically  as actual experience proves different from historical estimates  additional provisions are required 
the determination of impairment on long lived assets  including goodwill  is conducted as indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators were present  the determination of the amount of impairment would be based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
our industry is highly cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles may result in impairment charges 
factors affecting future operating results this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the forward looking statements are those that do not state historical facts and are inherently subject to risk and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties are set forth below 
the oil and gas industry in which the company participates historically has experienced significant volatility 
demand for the company s services and products depends primarily upon the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the volume of production  the number of well completions  the capital expenditures of other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors  the level of pipeline construction and maintenance expenditures  and the level of workover activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states and canada 
the willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which the company has no control  including the prevailing and expected market prices for oil and natural gas 
such prices are impacted by  among other factors  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to maintain price stability through voluntary production limits  the level of production of non opec countries  worldwide demand for oil and gas  general economic and political conditions  costs of exploration and production  availability of new leases and concessions  and governmental regulations regarding  among other things  environmental protection  taxation  price controls and product allocations 
no assurance can be given as to the level of future oil and gas industry activity or demand for the company s services and products 
the company s foreign operations  which include significant operations in canada  europe  the far east  the middle east and latin america  are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries  including uncertain political and economic environments  which may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which the company operates have adopted policies or are subject to governmental policies giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority owned by local nationals 
as a result of such policies  the company relies on joint ventures  license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries 
in addition  political considerations may disrupt the commercial relationship between the company and such government owned petroleum companies 
although the company has not experienced any significant problems in foreign countries arising from nationalistic policies  political instability  economic instability or currency restrictions  there can be no assurance that such a problem will not arise in the future 
the company s solids control  inspection and coating services routinely involve the handling of waste materials  some of which may be considered to be hazardous wastes 
the company is subject to numerous local  state and federal laws and regulations concerning the containment and disposal of materials  pursuant to which the company has been required to incur compliance and clean up costs  which were not substantial in   and compliance with environmental laws and regulations due to currently unknown circumstances or developments  however  could result in substantial costs and have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of the company s recent growth in revenues and profitability has been the result of its aggressive acquisition program 
the company s future operating results will be impacted by the company s ability to identify additional attractive acquisition opportunities  consummate such acquisitions on favorable terms and successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with those of the company 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not believe it has a material exposure to market risk 
the company has historically managed its exposure to interest changes by using a combination of fixed rate debt  variable rate debt  interest swap and collar agreements in its total debt portfolio 
as of december   the company had no interest rate swap or collar agreements outstanding 
at december   the company had million of outstanding debt 
fixed rate debt included million of senior notes net of discounts at a fixed rate of and million of senior notes net of discounts at a fixed interest rate of 
with respect to foreign currency fluctuations  the company uses natural hedges to minimize the effect of rate fluctuations 
when natural hedges are not sufficient  generally it is the company s policy to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant transactions for periods consistent with the underlying risk 
the company had no forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  the company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes
