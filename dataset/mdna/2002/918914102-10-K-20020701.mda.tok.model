the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes  which are part of this report or incorporated by reference to our reports filed with the commission 
we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
business and business strategy founded in  our business has been driven primarily by our research and development efforts  which have fostered our intellectual property position  currently consisting of issued and pending patents  including patents issued in the united states 
since our inception  we have been focused on acquiring and developing our technology  developing our manufacturing capabilities  recruiting personnel  establishing our sales channels and pipeline and acquiring capital 
with the appointment of stephan b 
godevais as our chief executive officer and president in may  we initiated the transition of our business by broadening our marketing and sales efforts to take advantage of our strengths in research and development 
with this strategic shift  our vision is to become a leader in energy solutions by drawing on the numerous benefits of our latest battery technology  the extensive experience of our management team and the significant market opportunity available to us 
our business strategy is to leverage our innovations in battery technology to capitalize on the significant opportunities in the energy solutions market 
the strategy comprises the introduction of our next generation phosphate based saphion tm lithium ion technology  a balance of system sales and licensing  and a manufacturing plan that leverages internal capabilities as well as oem relationships 
the strategy has been separated into three phases technology phase  product phase and customer phase  incorporating key milestones in each 
page we have introduced our phosphate based  saphion tm lithium ion technology and have transitioned production from research and development to our northern ireland manufacturing facility 
we believe our saphion tm technology addresses the major weaknesses of existing lithium ion alternatives while offering a solution that is competitive in cost and performance 
the system sales component of the strategy involves capitalizing on our advanced technology and understanding of certain market segments to design solutions that differentiate end customers products and to develop new  emerging markets for our saphion tm lithium ion technology solutions 
our systems sales strategy includes i continuing sales of our cobalt and manganese based stacked polymer batteries solutions to small to mid sized companies where the flexibility of design and thinness of the stacked polymer is paramount  ii developing the market for saphion tm technology through our own product launches  such as the n charge tm power system  and products designed by others  such as the wistron deal announced in february and iii maximizing the adoption of saphion tm technology by offering it in both polymer and cylindrical constructions 
our licensing strategy is to pursue technology licenses of intellectual property related to patent protected manufacturing processes and battery chemistries 
our stacked polymer battery manufacturing process and saphion tm technology are our key assets in the licensing arena 
in addition  we intend to partner with large material producers to leverage their manufacturing capabilities and existing sales channels 
this should facilitate the rapid adoption of our saphion tm technology and provide a source for licensing and royalty revenue 
our manufacturing strategy involves both our own manufacturing capabilities in the northern ireland facility and oem relationships 
in may  we entered into an oem agreement with amperex technology limited  and intend to seek additional oem partners for cylindrical cell construction and worldwide material production 
we plan to enter into contracted manufacturing arrangements with cylindrical battery manufacturers 
we believe this manufacturing strategy will allow us to deliver to a broad range of customer needs from low cost  high volume to highly customized  higher value added solutions 
we have outlined our business strategy in three phases as follows technology phase during this phase we evangelized the technology  completed our management team  announced the first major design win from a systems sales standpoint and signed an oem agreement for the production of lithium ion polymer batteries 
this phase of our business transformation began in august  and while ongoing  all but one  of our milestones have been met 
product phase during this phase we expect to complete the design of new products and continue the marketing to potential phosphate licensees  begin to launch phosphate products  announce key milestones around phosphate production and begin phosphate product ramps from both our northern ireland facility and oem partners 
this phase began in february with the launch of the n charge tm power system 
we are ramping up production of our phosphate batteries out of our northern ireland facility and are pursuing contract manufacturing arrangements with cylindrical battery manufacturers with the objective of using saphion tm technology as a drop in lithium ion chemistry replacement for notebook computers and communication devices 
customer phase during this phase  which will become our ongoing business  we expect to engage with customers regarding the launch of products using saphion tm technology 
on february  we announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with acer to work together to introduce the n charge tm power system  which is powered by saphion tm technology 
on the same date  we announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with wistron to work together on a new mobile device that would include our saphion tm technology 
on march   we announced that our n charge tm power system will be featured in hewlett packard s education solutions portfolio product bundle for the k education market 
subsequent to march   we began shipment of the n charge tm power system to hewlett packard 
we have engaged with several other tier oems regarding the n charge tm system and the use of our saphion tm technology in other applications 
we have established a strategy that we believe will allow us to expand our market opportunity 
through the sale of our current technology and the licensing and market development of our saphion tm technology  we believe we are equipped to serve existing lithium ion technology markets as well as open doors to new market opportunities 
page results of operations fiscal years ended march  fiscal  march  fiscal and march  fiscal revenue 
the following table summarizes the company s revenue by type for each of the past three fiscal years march  percentage march  percentage march  change change amounts in s battery and laminate sales    license and royalty revenue   n a total revenues    battery and laminate sales we completed our first commercial sale of batteries during february during fiscal  we achieved an increase of in revenue from sales of battery and laminate 
in december  we completed the acquisition of technology rights from telcordia technologies  inc and correspondingly completed a strategic shift away from expanding our battery and laminate sales pipeline to an emphasis on licensing and royalty revenue 
during fiscal  we implemented a balanced strategy leveraging revenues from both our licensing and battery and laminate lines of business 
as a result of the strategic shifts  our revenue for battery and laminate sales decreased to million in fiscal licensing and royalty revenue in december  we completed the acquisition of technology rights from telcordia technologies  inc we recorded initial revenues from licensing totaling million during fiscal during fiscal  we expanded our licensee base  including the conversion of a joint venture to a licensee  and began collecting royalties from our licensees resulting in a increase in license and royalty revenue 
total revenues revenues from six significant customers represented a total of of total revenues for the fiscal year and a total of of the trade accounts receivable at march  for fiscal year  five customers represented of total revenues for the year and of trade accounts receivable at march  in the fiscal year ended march   two customers had of the total revenues for the year 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of expenses incurred to manufacture battery and laminate products 
we initiated the recording of costs of sales as we ramped production and began our transition from a research and development focused organization during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded cost of sales of million 
comparably  cost of sales totaled million during fiscal  net of grant funding of million provided by the northern ireland industrial development board  now known as invest northern ireland or ini  as a reduction of labor costs 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal represents over a reduction of costs of sales as a percentage of sales 
the substantial decrease in fiscal from fiscal is due to continued automation improvements in the northern ireland facility and the reduction in battery and laminate production volumes 
research and product development 
research and product development expenses consist primarily of personnel  equipment and materials to support the company s battery and product research and development 
research and product development expense totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the million or increase in research and product development expenses from fiscal to relates to the both additional engineering for development of the our first end user product and expanded development and pilot production of our saphion chemistry 
the million or decrease in research and product development expenses from fiscal to reflects our initial transition from solely a research and development focus 
marketing 
marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing personnel  public relations and promotional materials 
marketing expenses were million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the million or increase in marketing expenses during fiscal resulted from increased personnel  the launch of a new corporate web site  the development of our on line store  and the creation of promotional materials and sales tools 
our increased expenditures during fiscal and are in line with our transition from a research and development focused organization to a sales and customer focused entity 
page general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for finance  human resources  accounting  information technology  legal  and corporate related expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march    and respectively 
the million or increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal relate primarily to increased recruiting efforts associated with completion of the management team and relocation of the corporate office to austin  texas 
the million or increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was due to additional finance and management headcount  increased spending on investor relations  insurance  environmental compliance  and legal fees associated with intellectual property transactions 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the million or decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses during fiscal resulted primarily from the impact of an impairment charge taken during the third quarter of fiscal as described below 
this decrease is partially offset by depreciation for capital assets acquired during fiscal impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
the charge was recorded pursuant to fasb statement no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we refined our business strategy and solidified our manufacturing plan and product mix 
as a result  we determined that the future cash flows expected to be generated from older manufacturing equipment in our northern ireland facility and intellectual property acquired in the telcordia transaction in december did not exceed their carrying value 
this determination resulted in a net impairment charge against property  plant and equipment and intellectual property to adjust these assets to their fair value 
factory start up costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company started shipping commercial quality grade batteries under an existing purchase order 
the cost of raw materials used to bring the machinery up to production quality  along with related consumables and direct labor  were separated as factory start up costs in the amount of million 
stockholder lawsuit settlement 
as announced on february   we reached a settlement in the securities class action lawsuit that had been pending against the company 
the court approved settlement dismissed all claims against us and all other defendants without presumption or admission of any liability or wrong doing 
under the terms of the settlement  a payment of million in cash was made  and we issued  shares of common stock  to the class fund 
we took an accounting charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal of million or per share for the impact of this settlement 
interest and other income 
interest and other income increased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  interest and other income increased to million for the fiscal year ended march   from  for the fiscal year ended march  the increases in both fiscal and were due primarily to increased investment income 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  interest expense increased to million for the fiscal year ended march   from million for the fiscal year ended march  the increases for both fiscal and in were the result of increased borrowings from berg berg 
equity in earnings loss of joint venture 
in june  we reached and agreement with our joint venture partner  hanil telecom co  ltd 
hanil telecom to terminate the hanil valence korean joint venture 
as conditions of the termination  shinhan bank transferred its payment guarantee obligations under a line of credit from us to hanil telecom and we granted a license to an affiliate of hanil telecom 
in addition  the deferred revenue balance of million was offset by approximately  of accounts receivable and the remaining million balance was recorded as license revenue to recognize the license agreement 
liquidity and capital resources at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  on april  we raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of million shares of our common stock 
in addition  as of march  page we had million available under a loan agreement and million available under an equity line of credit with berg berg enterprises 
this equity line of credit is subject to stockholder approval at our annual meeting and completion of definitive documentation 
we have commitments for capital expenditures for the next months of approximately million relating to specified manufacturing equipment  which is included in accrued expenses at march  we may require additional capital expenditures in order to meet greater demand levels for our products than are currently anticipated 
after taking into account our cash and cash equivalents  projected cash flows from licensing and systems sales and available funding from our loan agreement and equity line of credit  we expect that we will have sufficient financing through fiscal to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and investment requirements 
at our current level of operations  we are using cash from operations of approximately to million per quarter 
we expect our cash requirements to increase as our sales increase  and we intend to manage our capital expenditures based on our then available sources of cash 
we may have additional sources of cash from the commercialization of our saphion tm technology into new markets and customers in addition to the sale of new products announced in february however  at this time we are not able to accurately forecast cash from these sources 
we used net cash from operations for fiscal  and of million  million and million  respectively 
the cash used in our fiscal operating activities was primarily due to net loss and the add back of non cash expenses  including depreciation and amortization  provision for bad debt  impairment charge  accretion of debt discount  and compensation related to issuance of stock options 
the decrease in operating cash outflows was substantially due to operational improvements  lower production levels and inventory utilization in our northern ireland facility 
we used million  million and million in investing activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures during fiscal and fiscal were primarily related to the establishment and expansion of our manufacturing facilities and equipment in our dutch subsidiary 
we obtained cash from financing activities of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a result of the above  we had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million and million in fiscal and  and a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million in fiscal as of march   our short term and long term debt obligations were  and million respectively 
during fiscal  we reached an agreement with mr 
berg to extend the maturity date of our loan agreement with the loan balance of million and accrued interest of million from august  to september  during fiscal year  we  through our dutch subsidiary  signed an agreement with the ini to open an automated manufacturing plant in northern ireland in exchange for capital and revenue grants from the ini 
the grants available under the agreement and offers for an aggregate of up to pound million  generally became available over a five year period through october  as a condition to receiving funding from ini  the subsidiary must maintain a minimum of pound million approximately million in debt or equity financing from the company 
as of march   we had received grants aggregating pound million million 
the amount of the grants available under the agreement and offers depends primarily on the level of capital expenditures that are made by the company 
substantially all of the funding received under the grants is repayable to the ini if the subsidiary is in default under the agreement and offers  which includes the permanent cessation of business in northern ireland 
funding received under the grants to offset capital expenditures is repayable if related equipment is sold  transferred or otherwise disposed of during a four year period after the date of grant 
in addition  a portion of funding received under the grants may also be repayable if the subsidiary fails to maintain specified employment levels for the two year period immediately after the end of the five year grant period 
as a result of the temporary reduction of northern ireland business activity  specified employment levels have not been maintained  but the ini is not seeking repayment and on the advice of counsel  on the basis that successful negotiations will be concluded  we do not believe that the ini will bring any legal action pursuant to the letter of offer 
we have begun discussion with the ini to end the current agreement and enter into a new agreement more closely aligned to current business conditions 
we may not be able to meet the requirements necessary to retain grants under the ini agreement 
although it is unlikely  the ini could demand repayment of a portion of the total amounts received  which include revenue grants of million and equipment grants of million 
since inception  we have experienced significant losses and negative cash flow from operations 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  anticipated cash flows from our operating activities and available financing will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs through fiscal if our working capital requirements and capital page expenditures are greater than we expect  we may need to raise additional debt or equity financing in order to provide for our operations 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
recent events pursuant to a letter agreement and release effective march   we disposed of certain assets consisting of cash and investment equivalent instruments valued at approximately million in exchange for a discharge and release of all obligations under our loan agreement with berg berg enterprises  llc dated february  that loan agreement had an outstanding balance in the principal amount of  and accrued and unpaid interest of  at march  inflation historically  our operations have not been materially affected by inflation 
however  our operations may be affected by inflation in the future 
risk factors cautionary statements and risk factors several of the matters discussed in this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
factors associated with the forward looking statements that could cause actual results to differ from those projected or forecasted in this report are included in the statements below 
in addition to other information contained in this report  you should carefully consider the following cautionary statements and risk factors 
risks related to our business we may have a need for additional financing 
we may need to raise additional capital 
if we cannot obtain additional financing on reasonable terms  or at all  we may not be able to execute our business strategy as planned and our results of operations would suffer 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  on april  we raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of million shares of our common stock 
in addition  at march  we had million available under a loan agreement and million available under an equity line of credit with berg berg enterprises 
our financing commitment with berg berg will enable us to access up to million per quarter but no more than million in the aggregate in equity capital over the next two years 
this commitment is subject to stockholder approval at our annual meeting and completion of definitive documentation 
in exchange for any amounts funded pursuant to this new agreement  we will issue to berg berg restricted common stock at a customary discount to market 
we will agree to register any shares we issue to berg berg under this agreement 
berg berg s obligation to fund the equity commitment is subject to conditions including  but not limited to  our achievement of operating milestones 
in addition  berg berg has the option to reduce the commitment to the extent we enter into a debt or equity financing arrangement with a third party at any time during the term of the commitment 
as a result of the offering we completed in april  berg berg may elect to reduce its commitment to  at our current level of operations  we are using cash from operations of approximately to million per quarter 
to sustain our operations for a longer period of time than can be funded from operations and our commitments from berg berg  we may need to seek additional financing 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including changes in oem relationships  market conditions  joint venture and business opportunities  or a request for repayment of a portion or all of our existing grants  which totaled million at march   from the northern ireland industrial development board 
page all of our assets are pledged as collateral under our loan agreements 
our failure to meet the obligations under our loan agreements could result in foreclosure of our assets 
all of our assets are pledged as collateral under various loan agreements 
if we fail to meet our obligations pursuant to these loan agreements  our lenders may declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest 
if we are unable to repay our debt  these lenders could proceed against our assets 
we have a history of losses  have an accumulated deficit and may never achieve or sustain significant revenues or profitability 
we have incurred operating losses each year since inception in and had an accumulated deficit of million as of march  we have negative working capital of million as of march   and have sustained recurring losses related primarily to the research and development and marketing of our products 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows through fiscal  as we begin to build inventory  increase our marketing efforts and continue our product development 
we may never achieve or sustain significant revenues or profitability in the future 
our business may be adversely affected if our saphion tm technology batteries are not commercially accepted 
we are researching and developing batteries based upon phosphate chemistry 
our batteries are designed and manufactured as components for other companies and end user customers 
our success is dependent on the acceptance of our batteries and the products using our batteries in their markets 
market acceptance may depend on a variety of factors  including educating the target market regarding the benefits of our products 
market acceptance and market share are also affected by the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
if we or our customers are unable to gain any significant market acceptance for saphion tm technology based batteries  our business will be adversely affected 
it is too early to determine if saphion tm technology based batteries will achieve significant market acceptance 
if we are unable to develop  manufacture and market products that gain wide customer acceptance  our business may be adversely affected 
the process of developing our products is complex and uncertain  and failure to anticipate customers changing needs and to develop products that receive widespread customer acceptance could significantly harm our results of operations 
we must make long term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will eventually result in products that the market will accept 
after a product is developed  we must be able to manufacture sufficient volumes quickly and at low costs 
to accomplish this  we must accurately forecast volumes  mix of products and configurations that meet customer requirements  and we may not succeed 
failure to develop sales channels for our current and future end user products would significantly impact our future revenue and profitability 
we introduced the n charge tm power system  our first end user product in february we must develop reliable sales channels for distribution of our n charge tm product and any future end user products 
if our n charge tm product is not commercially accepted  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
in addition  failure to develop effective sales channels will significantly impact our future revenue and profitability 
our failure to develop partnerships with other battery manufacturers will limit our ability to widely introduce our phosphate chemistry technology into the marketplace and could significantly impact our sales and profitability in future periods 
to successfully implement our business strategy of broadly disseminating the saphion tm technology  we intend to develop relationships with manufacturers of lithium ion batteries using stacked polymer technology as well as cylindrical battery manufacturers 
our failure to develop these relationships will limit our ability to widely introduce our phosphate chemistry technology into the marketplace and could significantly impact our sales and profitability in future periods 
page we recently formed relationships with three of the world s leading personal computer vendors 
these relationships may not result in sales or profitability 
we recently entered into a memorandum of understanding with each of acer and wistron for the development of devices using our technology 
additionally  we have entered into a relationship with hewlett packard in which our n charge tm product will be featured in hewlett packard s education solutions portfolio product bundle 
subsequently  hewlett packard placed an initial purchase order and we began shipment of the n charge tm product in april  neither the memoranda of understanding with acer or wistron nor the relationship with hewlett packard requires the companies to make any financial commitments to us and may not lead to additional purchase orders 
as a result  these relationships may not result in significant sales of products incorporating our saphion tm technology  including sales of our n charge tm product 
if these relationships result in additional sales  we cannot assure you that they will be profitable 
if these relationships do not lead to significant purchase orders  our future revenues and profitability may be materially adversely affected 
because our batteries are intended primarily to be incorporated into other products  we will need to rely on original equipment manufacturers to commercialize our products 
we may not obtain adequate assistance from these third parties to successfully commercialize our products 
our business strategy contemplates that we will be required to rely heavily on assistance from original equipment manufacturers to gain market acceptance for our products 
we therefore will need to identify acceptable original equipment manufacturers and enter into agreements with them 
once we identify acceptable original equipment manufacturers and enter into agreements with them  we will need to meet these companies requirements by developing and introducing new products and enhanced  or modified  versions of our existing products on a timely basis 
original equipment manufacturers often require unique configurations or custom designs for batteries  which must be developed and integrated into their product well before the product is launched 
this development process not only requires substantial lead time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized battery system and the commencement of volume shipments of the battery system to the customer  but also requires the cooperation and assistance of the original equipment manufacturers for purposes of determining the battery requirements for each specific application 
if we are unable to design  develop and introduce products that meet original equipment manufacturers requirements  we may lose opportunities to enter into additional purchase orders and our reputation may be damaged 
as a result  we may not receive adequate assistance from original equipment manufacturers or battery pack assemblers to successfully commercialize our products  which could impair our profitability 
failure to implement an effective licensing business strategy could adversely affect our revenue  cash flow and profitability 
in december  we acquired the intellectual property assets of telcordia technologies  inc as a result of the acquisition of these intellectual property assets and the internal development of our saphion tm technology  we significantly increased the role of licensing in our business strategy 
we have not entered into any licensing agreements for our saphion tm technology 
our future operating results could be affected by a variety of factors including o our ability to secure and maintain significant customers of our proprietary technology  o the extent to which our future licensees successfully incorporate our technology into their products  o the acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our technology  o the rate that our licensees manufacture and distribute their products to oems  o our ability to secure one time license fees and ongoing royalties for our technology from licensees 
our future success will also depend on our ability to execute our licensing operations simultaneously with our other business activities 
if we fail to substantially expand our licensing activities while maintaining our other business activities  our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
page failure to obtain international regulatory approval for commercial shipments of phosphate material would cause delays in the production ramp plan for our battery technology and result in delays or losses of revenues associated with that plan 
we currently are shipping phosphate material from our facility in henderson  nevada to our manufacturing facility in mallusk  northern ireland as research and development material 
we must receive regulatory approval from the appropriate international regulatory entities to ship commercial quantities of the material 
failure to obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals internationally would cause delays in the production ramp plan for our battery technology and result in delays or losses of revenue associated with that plan 
our failure to cost effectively manufacture batteries in commercial quantities  which satisfy our customers product specifications  could damage our customer relationships and result in significant lost business opportunities for us 
to be successful  we must cost effectively manufacture commercial quantities of our batteries that meet customer specifications 
to facilitate commercialization of our products  we will need to reduce our manufacturing costs  which includes substantially raising and maintaining battery yields of commercial quality in a cost effective manner 
if we fail to substantially increase yields in our manufacturing process and reduce unit manufacturing costs  we will not be able to offer our batteries at a competitive price  and we will lose our current customers and fail to attract future customers 
failure to scale up our manufacturing facility will harm our customer relations and threaten future profits 
we have begun to manufacture batteries on a commercial scale to fulfill purchase orders and we are able to produce sufficient quantities of batteries for short term needs 
we continue to install  de bug and qualify equipment in our manufacturing facility 
if we fail to develop and efficiently operate a large scale manufacturing facility capable of cost effectively producing significant quantities of batteries according to customer specifications  our ability to serve the needs of our customers will be harmed and our future sales and profits will be threatened 
our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until the patents issue or are published 
since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months  we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions 
we also can not be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford protection against a competitor 
in addition  patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws  rules and procedures which differ from those of the united states  and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued united states patents will issue 
furthermore  if these patent applications issue  some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than the united states 
the status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that patent applications we file will result in patents being issued  or that our patents and any patents that may be issued to us in the future will afford protection against competitors with similar technology 
in addition  patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around  either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our operations 
if we cannot protect or enforce our existing intellectual property rights or if our pending patent applications do not result in issued patents  we may lose the advantages of our research and manufacturing systems 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on whether we can protect our existing proprietary technology and manufacturing processes 
we rely on a combination of patent and trade secret protection  non disclosure agreements and cross licensing agreements 
these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the proprietary technology underlying our batteries 
employees  consultants  and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their non disclosure agreements with us  and we may not have adequate remedies in the event of their breaches 
in addition  our competitors may be able to develop products that are equal or superior to our page products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
moreover  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights outside of the united states 
we have established a program for intellectual property documentation and protection in order to safeguard our technology base 
we intend to vigorously pursue enforcement and defense of our patents and our other proprietary rights 
we could incur significant expenses in preserving our proprietary rights  and these costs could harm our financial condition 
we also are attempting to expand our intellectual property rights through our applications for new patents 
we cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that our issued patents will afford us protection against a competitor 
our inability to protect our existing proprietary technologies or to develop new proprietary technologies may substantially impair our financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and if any of our products or processes are found to be infringing  we may not be able to procure licenses to use patents necessary to our business at reasonable terms  if at all 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
while we currently are not engaged in any intellectual property litigation or proceedings  we may become involved in these proceedings in the future 
in the future we may be subject to claims or inquiries regarding our alleged unauthorized use of a third party s intellectual property 
an adverse outcome in litigation could force us to do one or more of the following o stop selling  incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property  o pay significant damages to third parties  o obtain from the owners of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or o redesign those products or manufacturing processes that use the infringed technology  which may be economically or technologically infeasible 
whether or not an intellectual property litigation claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  could be expensive and harm our business 
our ability to manufacture large volumes of batteries is limited and may prevent us from fulfilling orders 
we are actively soliciting additional purchase orders 
we are qualifying additional automated equipment at our facility in mallusk  northern ireland which will provide us with sufficient capacity to assemble batteries in high volumes 
we expect this equipment to be fully operational during the second quarter of fiscal if we cannot rapidly increase our production capabilities to make sufficient quantities of commercially acceptable batteries  we may not be able to fulfill purchase orders in a timely manner  if at all 
in addition  we may not be able to procure additional purchase orders  which could cause us to lose existing and future customers  purchase orders  revenue and profits 
if our batteries fail to perform as expected  we could lose existing and future business  and our long term ability to market and sell our batteries could be harmed 
if we manufacture our batteries in commercial quantities and they fail to perform as expected  our reputation could be severely damaged  and we could lose existing or potential future business 
even if the performance failure is corrected  this performance failure might have the long term effect of harming our ability to market and sell our batteries 
page we depend on a small number of customers for our revenues  and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we were to lose the business of any one of them 
to date  our existing purchase orders in commercial quantities are from a limited number of customers 
we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of key customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our customers and do not expect to enter into any long term agreements in the near future 
as a result  we face the substantial risk that any of the following events could occur o reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from a customer  o development by a customer of other sources of supply  o selection by a customer of devices manufactured by one of our competitors for inclusion in future product generations  o loss of a customer or a disruption in our sales and distribution channels  and o failure of a customer to make timely payment of our invoices 
if we were to lose one or more customers  or if we were to lose revenues due to a customer s inability or refusal to continue to purchase our batteries  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
the fact that we depend on a sole source supplier or a limited number of suppliers for key raw materials might delay our production of batteries 
we depend on a sole source supplier or a limited number of suppliers for certain key raw materials used in manufacturing and developing our batteries 
we generally purchase raw materials pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time and have no long term contracts or other guaranteed supply arrangements with our sole or limited source suppliers 
as a result  our suppliers may not be able to meet our requirements relative to specifications and volumes for key raw materials  and we may not be able to locate alternative sources of supply at an acceptable cost 
we have in the past experienced delays in product development due to the delivery of nonconforming raw materials from our suppliers  and if in the future we are unable to obtain high quality raw materials in sufficient quantities on competitive pricing terms and on a timely basis  it may delay battery production  impede our ability to fulfill existing or future purchase orders and harm our reputation and profitability 
we have four key executives 
the loss of a single executive or the failure to hire and integrate capable new executives could harm our business 
other than our written employment agreement with stephan b 
godevais  our president and chief executive officer  we do not have written employment contracts and do not have key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our key members of management 
without qualified executives  we face the risk that we will not be able to effectively run our business on a day to day basis or execute our long term business plan 
our revenue from license fees and royalties will depend significantly on the success of our licensees and the market demand for their products 
we expect to generate income from license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on sales by licensees that design  manufacture and sell batteries incorporating our technology 
license fees will be nonrefundable and may be paid in one or more installments 
ongoing royalties will be nonrefundable and generally based on a percentage of the selling price of the batteries that incorporate our technology sold by the licensee 
because we expect to derive a portion of our future revenues from royalties on shipments by our licensees  our future success depends upon the ability of our licensees to develop and introduce high volume batteries that achieve and sustain market acceptance 
if our licensees are not successful or the demand for lithium ion polymer batteries  saphion tm technology batteries or devices utilizing these batteries does not increase  our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected 
in addition  our license fee revenues depend on our ability to gain additional licensees within existing and new markets 
page a reduction in the demand for lithium ion polymer batteries  saphion tm technology batteries  our loss of key existing licensees or our failure to gain additional licensees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
there is a potential sales channel conflict between our future technology licensees and us 
the acquisition of the telcordia intellectual property assets and our saphion tm technology licensing strategy has added significant diversity to our overall business structure and our opportunities 
we recognize that there is potential for a conflict among our sales channels and those of our future technology licensees 
although our manufacturing and marketing business generally is complimentary to our licensing business  sales channel conflicts may arise 
if these potential conflicts do materialize  we may not be able to mitigate the effect of a conflict that  if not resolved  may impact our results of operations 
our oxide based batteries  which now comprise a small portion of our available products  contain potentially dangerous materials  which could expose us to product liability claims 
in the event of a short circuit or other physical damage to an oxide based battery  a reaction may result with excess heat or a gas being generated and released 
if the heat or gas is not properly released  the battery may be flammable or potentially explosive 
we could  therefore  be exposed to possible product liability litigation 
in addition  our batteries incorporate potentially dangerous materials  including lithium 
it is possible that these materials may require special handling or that safety problems may develop in the future 
we are aware that if the amounts of active materials in our batteries are not properly balanced and if the charge discharge system is not properly managed  a dangerous situation may result 
battery pack assemblers using batteries incorporating technology similar to ours include special safety circuitry within the battery to prevent such a dangerous condition 
we expect that our customers will have to use a similar type of circuitry in connection with their use of our oxide based products 
accidents at our facilities could delay production and adversely affect our operations 
an accident in our facilities could occur 
any accident  whether due to the production of our batteries or otherwise resulting from our facilities operations  could result in significant manufacturing delays or claims for damages resulting from personal or property injuries  which would adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we depend upon the continued operation of our northern ireland facility 
operational problems at this facility could harm our business 
our revenues are dependent upon the continued operation of our manufacturing facility in northern ireland 
the operation of a manufacturing plant involves many risks  including potential damage from fire or natural disasters 
in addition  we have obtained permits to conduct our business as currently operated at the facility 
if the facility were destroyed and rebuilt there is a possibility that these permits would not remain effective at the current location  and we may not be able to obtain similar permits to operate at another location 
the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our northern ireland facility may harm our business 
we expect to sell a significant portion of our products to and derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from customers located outside the united states 
foreign government regulations  currency fluctuations and increased costs associated with international sales could make our products and licenses unaffordable in foreign markets  which would reduce our future profitability 
we expect that international sales of our products and licenses  as well as licensing royalties will represent an increasingly significant portion of our sales 
international business can be subject to many inherent risks that are difficult or impossible for us to predict or control  including o changes in foreign government regulations and technical standards  including additional regulation of rechargeable batteries or technology or the transport of lithium and phosphate  which may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell or license in certain markets  o foreign governments may impose tariffs  quotas and taxes on our batteries or our import of technology into their countries  page o requirements or preferences of foreign nations for domestic products could reduce demand for our batteries and our technology  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates relative to the united states dollar could make our batteries and our technology unaffordable to foreign purchasers and licensees or more expensive compared to those of foreign manufacturers and licensors  o longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable may reduce the future profitability of foreign sales and royalties  o import and export licensing requirements in northern ireland or other countries where we intend to conduct business may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell or license in certain markets  and o political and economic instability in northern ireland or other countries where we intend to conduct business may reduce the demand for our batteries and our technology or our ability to market our batteries and our technology in those countries 
these risks may increase our costs of doing business internationally and reduce our sales and royalties or future profitability 
we must continue to expand our employee base and operations in order to distribute our products commercially  which may strain our management and resources and could harm our business 
to implement our growth strategy successfully  we will have to increase our staff  primarily with personnel in sales  marketing  and product support capabilities  as well as third party and direct distribution channels 
however  we face the risk that we may not be able to attract new employees to sufficiently increase our staff or product support capabilities  or that we will not be successful in our sales and marketing efforts 
failure in any of these areas could impair our ability to execute our plans for growth and adversely affect our future profitability 
competition for personnel  in particular for product development and product implementation personnel  is intense  and we may have difficulty attracting the personnel necessary to effectively operate our business 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel who are familiar with and experienced in the battery industry  as well as skilled personnel to operate our facility in northern ireland 
if we cannot attract and retain experienced sales and marketing executives  we may not achieve the visibility in the marketplace that we need to obtain purchase orders  which would have the result of lowering our sales and earnings 
we compete in the market for personnel against numerous companies  including larger  more established competitors with significantly greater financial resources than us 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business effectively in the future 
the limited number of skilled workers in northern ireland could affect the success of our improvements in the manufacturing facility 
we may need to hire and train additional manufacturing workers 
the availability of skilled workers in northern ireland is limited because of a relatively low unemployment rate 
as a result  we face the risk that we may not o hire and train the new manufacturing workers necessary for the ramp up of our mallusk  northern ireland manufacturing facility  o develop improved processes  o implement multiple production lines  or o efficiently operate the mallusk facility 
page our failure to efficiently automate our production on a timely basis  if at all  could damage our reputation  relationships with future and existing customers  cause us to lose business and potentially prevent us from establishing the commercial viability of our products 
political instability in northern ireland could interrupt manufacturing of our batteries and end user products at our northern ireland facility and cause us to lose sales and marketing opportunities 
northern ireland has experienced significant social and political unrest in the past and we cannot assure you that these instabilities will not continue in the future 
any political instability in northern ireland could temporarily or permanently interrupt our manufacturing of batteries and end user products at our facility in mallusk  northern ireland 
any delays could also cause us to lose sales and marketing opportunities  as potential customers would find other vendors to meet their needs 
risks associated with our industry if competing technologies that outperform our batteries were developed and successfully introduced  then our products might not be able to compete effectively in our targeted market segments 
rapid and ongoing changes in technology and product standards could quickly render our products less competitive  or even obsolete 
other companies are seeking to enhance traditional battery technologies  such as lead acid and nickel cadmium or have recently introduced or are developing batteries based on nickel metal hydride  liquid lithium ion and other emerging and potential technologies 
these competitors are engaged in significant development work on these various battery systems  and we believe that much of this effort is focused on achieving higher energy densities for low power applications such as portable electronics 
one or more new  higher energy rechargeable battery technologies could be introduced which could be directly competitive with  or superior to  our technology 
the capabilities of many of these competing technologies have improved over the past several years 
competing technologies that outperform our batteries could be developed and successfully introduced  and as a result  there is a risk that our products may not be able to compete effectively in our targeted market segments 
we have invested in research and development of next generation technology in energy solutions 
if we are not successful in developing and commercially exploiting new energy solutions based on new materials  or we experience delays in the development and exploitation of new energy solutions  compared to our competitors  our future growth and revenues will be adversely affected 
our principal competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and they may therefore develop batteries similar or superior to ours or otherwise compete more successfully than we do 
competition in the rechargeable battery industry is intense 
the industry consists of major domestic and international companies  most of which have financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than ours 
there is a risk that other companies may develop batteries similar or superior to ours 
in addition  many of these companies have name recognition  established positions in the market  and long standing relationships with original equipment manufacturers and other customers 
we believe that our primary competitors are existing suppliers of liquid lithium ion  competing polymer and  in some cases  nickel metal hydride batteries 
these suppliers include sanyo  matsushita industrial co  ltd 
panasonic  sony  toshiba  saft and electrovaya 
all of these companies are very large and have substantial resources and market presence 
we expect that we will compete against manufacturers of other types of batteries in our targeted application segments  which include laptops  cellular telephones and personal digital assistant products  on the basis of performance  size and shape  cost and ease of recycling 
there is also a risk that we may not be able to compete successfully against manufacturers of other types of batteries in any of our targeted applications 
laws regulating the manufacture or transport of batteries may be enacted which could result in a delay in the production of our batteries or the imposition of additional costs that would harm our ability to be profitable 
at the present time  international  federal  state or local law does not directly regulate the storage  use and disposal of the component parts of our batteries or the transport of our batteries 
however  laws and regulations may be enacted in the future which could impose environmental  health and safety controls on the storage  use  and disposal of certain chemicals and metals used in the manufacture of lithium polymer batteries as well as regulations governing the transport of our batteries 
satisfying any future laws or regulations could require significant time and page resources from our technical staff and possible redesign which may result in substantial expenditures and delays in the production of our product  all of which could harm our business and reduce our future profitability 
general risks associated with stock ownership corporate insiders or their affiliates will be able to exercise significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval that might not be in the best interests of our stockholders as a whole 
as of june   our officers  directors  and their affiliates as a group beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
carl berg  one of our directors  owns a substantial portion of that amount 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions  which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
the interest of our officers and directors  when acting in their capacity as stockholders  may lead them to o vote for the election of directors who agree with the incumbent officers or directors preferred corporate policy  or o oppose or support significant corporate transactions when these transactions further their interests as incumbent officers or directors  even if these interests diverge from their interests as shareholders per se and thus from the interests of other shareholders 
some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult  which could depress the price of our stock and limit the price potential acquirers may be willing to pay for your shares 
our board of directors has the authority  without any action by the stockholders  to issue additional shares of our preferred stock  which shares may be given superior voting  liquidation  distribution and other rights as compared to those of our common stock 
the rights of the holders of our capital stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may decrease the market price  and infringe upon the voting and other rights of the holders  of our common stock 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
factors that may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock include the following o fluctuation in our operating results  o announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  o failure to achieve operating results projected by securities analysts  o governmental regulation  o developments in our patent or other proprietary rights or our competitors developments  o our relationships with current or future collaborative partners  and o other factors and events beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
page as a result of this potential stock price volatility  investors may be unable to sell their shares of our common stock at or above the cost of their purchase prices 
in addition  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the subject of securities class action litigation  this could result in substantial costs  a diversion of our management s attention and resources and harm to our business and financial condition 
future sales of currently outstanding shares could adversely affect our stock price 
the market price of our common stock could drop as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or in response to the perception that these sales could occur 
in addition these sales might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
we had outstanding  shares of common stock as of june  in addition  at june   we had  shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under outstanding options and warrants  and  additional shares reserved for issuance under our stock option plans 
sales of shares eligible for future sale could impair our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market  or the perception that sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
this offering will result in additional shares of our common stock being available on the public market 
these factors could also make it more difficult to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
we do not intend to pay dividends and therefore you will only be able to recover your investment in our common stock  if at all  by selling the shares of our stock that you hold 
some investors favor companies that pay dividends 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
because we may not pay dividends  your return on an investment in our stock likely depends on your ability to sell your shares at a profit
