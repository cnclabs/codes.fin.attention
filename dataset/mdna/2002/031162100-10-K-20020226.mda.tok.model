financial outlook in the future  the company expects the growth of its anemia business to be driven primarily by aranesp tm sales in new markets 
the company expects growth in its us dialysis business to come primarily from patient population growth and inflation related price increases 
patients receiving treatment for end stage renal disease are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government 
therefore  epogen r sales may also be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government 
worldwide aranesp tm sales will be dependent in part upon such factors as the effects of competitive pressures  penetration of existing and new market opportunities  the availability and extent of reimbursement by third party payors including governments and private insurance plans  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
future neupogen r demand is dependent primarily upon penetration of existing markets  inflation related price increases  and the effects of competitive products

neupogen r usage is expected to continue to be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers worldwide 
in addition  reported neupogen r sales will continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of neupogen r are dependent  in part  on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as governments for example  medicare and medicaid programs in the us and private insurance plans 
therefore  neupogen r sales may also be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or changes in the bases for reimbursement

summary of critical accounting policies epogen r revenue recognition the company has the exclusive right to sell epoetin alfa for dialysis  certain diagnostics  and all non human  non research uses in the united states 
amgen has granted to johnson johnson a license relating to epoetin alfa for sales in the united states for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics 
pursuant to this license  the company and johnson johnson are required to compensate each other for epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party s exclusive market  sometimes referred to as spillover sales 
accordingly  amgen does not recognize product sales it makes into the exclusive market of johnson johnson and does recognize the product sales made by johnson johnson into amgen s exclusive market 
sales in amgen s exclusive market are derived from the company s sales to its customers  as adjusted for any spillover sales 
the company is employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party s spillover sales based on independent third party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage 
data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques  and accordingly  the results of such sampling can produce variability in recognized spillover sales 
the company initially recognizes spillover sales based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage  utilizing historical third party data and subsequently adjusts such amounts based on revised third party data as received 
differences between initially estimated spillover sales and amounts based on revised third party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized epogen r sales 
however  such differences to date have not been material
