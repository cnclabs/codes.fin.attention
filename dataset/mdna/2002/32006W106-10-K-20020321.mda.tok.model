item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations first defiance is a unitary thrift holding company which conducts business through its subsidiaries  first federal  first insurance and the leader 
first federal is a federally chartered savings bank that provides financial services to communities based in northwest ohio where it operates full service branches 
first federal provides a broad range of financial services including checking accounts  real estate mortgage loans  commercial loans  consumer loans  home equity loans  and trust services 
first insurance sells a variety of property and casualty  group health and life  and individual health and life insurance products and investment and annuity products 
insurance products are sold through first insurance s office in defiance  ohio while investment and annuity products are sold through investment representatives located at two first federal branch locations 
the leader is a mortgage banking company that specializes in servicing loans originated under first time homebuyer programs 
under these programs  first time homebuyers are able to obtain loans at rates generally below market at the time of closing 
the funds for the loans are available as a result of bond issues through various state and local governmental units 
the leader  as master servicer under the bond programs  purchases the loans from the originator  principally other financial institutions or mortgage brokers 
once purchased by the leader  the loans under the specific bond programs are packaged and gnma securities are issued to the bond trustees under the programs 
as of december   the leader serviced approximately  bond program loans with balances of billion 
because the loans under the first time homebuyer programs are generally issued at below market rates  they typically have significantly lower pre payment rates than conventional mortgage loans 
the leader also collects a significant amount of ancillary fees  including late charges 
at december   total loans serviced by the leader  including bond program loans  conventional loans and loans serviced for various third parties  consisted of  loans with a total balance of billion 
on january   first defiance announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the leader to us bank home mortgage  a unit of us bank 
financial condition total assets at december  were billion  a increase from the december  total of billion 
net loans receivable excluding loans held for sale declined by million and investment securities declined by million 
those decreases were offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents  which rose by million  loans held for sale  which increased by million  and mortgage servicing rights  which increased by million 
the reduction in loans receivable occurred primarily in the single family residential category  which declined by million 
this reduction was due to the high level of mortgage loan refinancings that occurred in due to the low interest rate environment 
the majority of loans refinanced were then sold into the secondary market to limit the company s exposure to interest rate risk on long term fixed rate loans 
approximately of new first mortgage loans made by first federal in were sold into the secondary market 
automobile loans also declined in  by million to million  continuing a trend that began in when the company implemented more stringent underwriting guidelines for that type of lending 
these declines were partially offset by increases in loans secured by non residential real estate which increased million to million  loans secured by multi family residential property which increased million to million  home equity and improvement loans which increased million to million and commercial loans which increased million to million 
loans available for sale and mortgage servicing rights  two assets primarily associated with the leader  both increased significantly at december  compared to december  loans available for sale increased to million at december  from million 
the increase was primarily due to the company s strategy to hold certain higher interest loans in the warehouse for extended periods to take advantage of the favorable interest rate spread 
mortgage servicing rights increased to million at december  from million at december  this growth is a function of continued loan production at the leader throughout the balance is net of a million impairment reserve 
there was no impairment reserve recorded as of december  the company s deposits increased by million or from million at december  to million at december  this growth was realized in checking accounts which increased million or  money market accounts which increased million or and certificates of deposit which increased million or 
of these deposit balances  million were associated with the leader at december  compared to million at the end of the certificate of deposit balances include approximately million of brokered cds at december   up from million at december  first defiance also realized a significant increase in advance payments by borrowers for principle  interest  taxes and insurance  which increased from million at december  to million at december  this balance increased due to the increased level of payoffs that were experienced in the mortgage banking operations 
the company has the right to hold those payoffs for up to days before they must be remitted to the investors 
as a result of the increases in deposits and advance payment accounts  first defiance was able to reduce its fhlb advances by million to million at december  from million at december  and its warehouse and term note borrowings by million to million at december  from million at december  changes in the above balances  and the inability to further pay down fixed rate fhlb advances  resulted in a higher than normal cash and cash equivalent balance at december  of million compared to million at december  paydowns and maturities of investment securities which were not reinvested because funds were deployed elsewhere resulted in the investment portfolio declining to million at december  from million at the end of average balances  interest rates and yields the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amounts of interest from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin

interest rate spread is the difference in the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets

net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
net interest margin was  and for the years ended december   and respectively 
the increase in net interest margin in over is due primarily to an increase in the interest rate spread from for the year ended december  to for  and increases of million  million and million in average non interest bearing deposits  average other non interest bearing liabilities  and average shareholders equity respectively 
the decrease in margins that were experienced in compared to were due primarily to the financing required to support the million increase in average non interest earning assets between and that increase was primarily the result of increases in mortgage servicing rights and prepaid expenses and other assets 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities dropped basis points in compared to while the yield on interest earning assets fell basis points between those same periods  resulting in the basis point spread improvement 
the cost of average interest bearing liabilities declined to for compared in while the yields on interest earning assets declined to in from in the decline in rates for both assets and liabilities was due to falling market rates throughout spurred by the federal reserve s cuts to the federal funds rate 
liability rates fell more than asset rates primarily due to the improved mix of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
on the asset side  loans receivable balances increased while lower yielding investment securities balances declined 
on the liability side  non interest bearing deposits and money market balances increased at a greater pace than certificates of deposit while fhlb advances remained flat and outside borrowings declined 
in compared to  the yield on interest earning assets increased to from while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased to from 
asset yields increased in because of increased balances in non residential real estate and commercial loans as well as general interest rate increases 
the increase in the cost of funds was the result of several increases in the targeted federal funds rate as well as increased usage of external funding sources to finance the growth in mortgage banking activities 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million for the provision was comprised of million for credit losses and million to cover the cost of servicing foreclosed properties in compared to  and million in credit and foreclosure costs in respectively and  and million in credit and foreclosure costs respectively in for the year ended december   non interest income was million compared to million for and million for non interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for and million for see also the results reflecting the sale of the leader mortgage company section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net interest income first defiance s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread ie the difference between the yields on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
total interest income increased by only  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  average loans receivable increased to million for from million for while average investment securities declined to million for from million 
although the average balance of total interest earning assets including fhlb stock increased by million in compared to  the yield on those total assets fell to in from in the average balance of loans held for sale increased to million for compared to million for while the average balance of non residential real estate and commercial loans grew to million for from million for also the average balance of home equity and improvement loans grew by million from december  to december  this growth was partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance of single family residential loans and a million decrease in the average balance of all consumer loans 
the increase in the average balance of non residential real estate and commercial loans is the result of the company s strategy to increase this type of lending 
residential mortgage loans declined because falling interest rates caused a high level of refinanced loans  most of which were subsequently sold into the secondary market 
the decline in consumer loans continues a trend that started in when the company tightened underwriting standards 
the increase in the average balance of available for sale loans is the result of the leader retaining certain loans which had higher interest rates than the typical housing finance agency loans that generally occupy its warehouse 
with the anticipated sale of the leader in  the available for sale balances will decline substantially while the balance of investment securities will increase significantly 
in  total interest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a million increase in the average balance of loans outstanding for compared to and an increase in yield to for from for the increase in balances were in non residential real estate and commercial loans  which increased in total by million  and loans held for sale  which increased by million  offset by declines in residential mortgage and consumer loans 
interest earnings from the investment portfolio and other interest bearing deposits decreased to million for from million for as the average balances declined to million for from million for the yield on those investments declined basis points during that period to for from for in  interest earnings from the investment portfolio totaled million as the average balance of million earned an average yield of 
because of the loan demand and the financing requirements of the leader  the investment portfolio has been used primarily as a source of liquidity during the last three years 
it is anticipated that when the sale of the leader is completed  the investment portfolio will increase significantly 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in compared to million in the decrease is due to a decline in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities to for from for the cost of interest bearing deposits dropped basis points  to in from in  the cost of fhlb advances dropped basis points  to from  and the cost of warehouse and other notes payable dropped basis points  to from 
the company also experienced million or growth in its non interest bearing deposit balances 
interest bearing deposit balances increased by million in compared to with much of the growth coming in the company s money market product 
the average balance of fhlb advances remained relatively stable between and while the average balance of warehouse and other term notes payable declined by million 
in  interest expense increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the increase is due to the increase in the average interest bearing liabilities to million in from million in additionally  the average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities increased to during from during the increased balances were due to increased funding requirements relating to loans held for sale and mortgage servicing rights at the leader and increased loan growth at first federal while the increased cost of funds is due to higher rates in resulting from several federal reserve increases in the targeted federal funds rate during as well as increased usage of outside financing sources to finance the leader s mortgage banking activities 
all warehouse and other notes payable will be paid off at the completion of the leader sale transaction in to the extent possible  certain fhlb advances and brokered certificates of deposits will be repaid or not replaced as they mature 
as a result of the foregoing  first defiance s net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net interest margin for the year ended december  increased to from for and for provision for loan losses first defiance s provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
the provision for loan losses is comprised of a provision for credit losses  which accounts for losses on first federal s loan portfolio  and a provision for foreclosure losses  which accounts for expected administrative and legal charges necessary to take loans through the foreclosure process 
foreclosure losses are entirely associated with the leader s mortgage servicing portfolio 
the credit loss portion of the provision was million   and  respectively in  and respectively while the foreclosure loss portion of the provision was million  million and million respectively in those same three years 
provisions for credit losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level that is deemed appropriate by management 
factors considered by management include identifiable risk in the portfolios  historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by first defiance  regulatory guidance  the amount of non performing assets  including loans which meet the fasb statement no 
definition of impaired  general economic conditions  particularly as they relate to first defiance s market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of first defiance s loan portfolio 
continued growth in non residential and commercial loans at first federal  which have an inherently higher level of risk than other types of loans  and concerns about economic conditions in the northwest ohio market area caused the provision for credit losses to increase in from and levels 
the allowance for credit losses totaled million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  total credit charge offs for and were million each year and million in while recoveries for those same three years were   and  respectively 
the high level of charge offs recorded in related to underwriting problems first federal experienced with its consumer loan portfolio in and those charge offs were provided for in a large adjustment to the allowance for loan losses recorded by first federal in first defiance s non performing assets at december  were million compared to million at december  these totals include real estate owned by the leader of million and  at the end of and respectively 
the increase in real estate owned is primarily due to the slowing economy which tends to impact the borrowers in the programs in which the leader specializes 
first federal s non performing assets were million at december  compared to million at december  non performing assets include loans that are days past due and all real estate owned and other foreclosed assets 
non performing assets at first federal at december  and by category were as follows december in thousands non performing loans single family residential  non residential and multi family residential real estate commercial consumer finance total non performing loans   real estate owned and repossessed assets total non performing assets   the  balance of non performing non residential and multi family residential real estate loans represents a  or increase from the level 
total non residential and multi family real estate loans increased by million over that same period 
non performing loans in the non residential and multi family residential real estate loan category represent 
of the total loans in that category at december  compared to 
at december  this increase is primarily due to one commercial loan that is more than days past due and management believes the allowance for loan losses for this loan is adequate to cover any potential loss the increase in single family non performing loans  while significant  should not materially impact first defiance s results 
these non performing loans are comprised of single family mortgage loans with an average balance of  outstanding at december  these loans are generally well secured 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover any potential losses on these loans 
during the year ended december   the leader recorded a provision for foreclosure losses totaling million compared to foreclosure provisions of million and million recorded in and respectively 
in  management changed its method of estimating the required reserve for potential losses on foreclosures to more accurately reflect the total risk inherent in the servicing and loan portfolios at the leader 
this resulted in a one time increase in the provision for foreclosure losses of  excluding the one time adjustment in  the provision for foreclosure losses increased million between and this increase is a result of a growing portfolio and a weaker economy nationwide 
the borrowers who participate in the first time homebuyers tend to be among the first impacted by a weaker economy 
non interest income non interest income increased by million to million in from million in and million in million of the non interest income was related to operations that are being sold as part of the leader sale transaction 
the leader accounted for million and million of the non interest income in and  respectively 
non interest income  excluding the leader  was million in compared to million in and million in the increase from to was primarily attributable to gains on sale of mortgage loans  which increased to approximately million in from approximately  in the increase was the result of record mortgage originations through first federal s branch networks caused by low mortgage interest rates throughout the year 
loan and deposit fees at first federal increased to million in from million in and commission income at first insurance increased to million from million 
in  gains on mortgage loan sales totaled  while loan and deposit fees were million and insurance agency income was million 
the leader s non interest income increased each year between and because of continued growth in the mortgage servicing portfolio  which resulted in growth in mortgage servicing fees  and increases in gains on sale  a result of a significant increase in mortgage production in the first time homebuyer programs between and also  results included million in gains from the sale of certain loans  which had a history of delinquency  out of the servicing portfolio to a third party 
these transactions were accomplished by purchasing the loans out of the servicing portfolio at par as allowed under the servicing agreements and then selling the loans to a third party at a premium 
non interest expense total non interest expense for was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the total includes million of costs associated with the leader while the and totals include million and million of the leader s costs respectively 
excluding expenses that relate to the leader  non interest expense was million for  million for and million for the million increase from to was caused primarily by a million increase in compensation and benefits  and a million increase in amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights 
compensation and benefits increased approximately  because of pay raises   because of increases in various forms of incentive compensation linked to the performance of the company and  related to staffing increases  including a full year of staffing of the bowling green  ohio branch that opened in the fall of mortgage servicing rights amortization and impairment increased approximately  because of growth in the servicing portfolio and because approximately  of the million of the impairment adjustment recorded by the leader against its mortgage servicing portfolio related to servicing rights that will be retained by first federal after the close of the leader sale transaction 
the million increase in non interest expense at the leader between and was almost all related to the amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights 
amortization expense related to the mortgage servicing portfolio that will be part of the leader sale increased to million in from million in because of both the increase in prepayments on the underlying loans in the mortgage servicing portfolio and the growth in the servicing portfolio itself 
the leader also recorded a total of million of impairment reserves during as the estimated fair value of certain portions of the leader s servicing portfolio was determined to be less than its book value 
as noted above   of the million of impairment relates to the relatively small component of the mortgage servicing portfolio that will be retained by first federal 
other components of non interest expense at the leader changed only slightly between and the leader experienced a million increase in its compensation and benefits expense between and and the amortization of mortgage servicing rights also increased by approximately million between those two periods 
income taxes income tax amounted to million in compared to million in and million in the effective rates for those three years were  and respectively 
concentrations of credit risk financial institutions such as first defiance generate income primarily through lending and investing activities 
the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility is known as credit risk 
credit risk is increased by lending or investing activities that concentrate a financial institution s assets in a way that exposes the institution to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one manner a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels 
first defiance s loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its northwest ohio market area 
there are no industry concentrations which exceed of the company s loan portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through first federal s branch network  along with unused wholesale sources of funding and its capital base 
these funds  along with investment securities  provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments 
cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
for each of those three years  the company used more cash in operating activities than was provided 
the adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans less the origination of loans held for sale  the provision for loan losses  depreciation expense  goodwill amortization  esop expense related to the release of esop shares in accordance with aicpa sop  the origination and amortization of mortgage servicing rights and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities 
the primary investing activity of first defiance is lending  which is funded with cash provided from operations and financing activities  as well as proceeds from payments on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of securities 
in  cash provided from the sale and maturity of investment securities totaled million while million in additional securities were purchased 
principal financing activities include the gathering of deposits and advance payments from loan servicing customers  the utilization of fhlb advances  and borrowings from other banks 
for the year ended december   deposits and advance payments by loan servicing customers increased by million while fhlb advances decreased by million and warehouse and term notes payable decreased by million

to meet its obligations  management can adjust the rate on savings certificates to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments  it can sell or securitize mortgage and non mortgage loans  and it can turn to other sources of financing including fhlb advances  the federal reserve bank  bank lines and brokered certificates of deposit 
at december  first defiance had million of capacity under its lines of credit with other financial institutions 
after the sale of the leader is complete  all bank lines will be paid off and retired 
fhlb advances will also be paid down to the extent possible 
however  million has been borrowed under either fixed or structured fhlb advances that can not be immediately repaid without significant penalties 
management anticipates utilizing these advances after the sale of the leader to purchase investment securities pending other lending and investment opportunities 
stockholders equity increased by million  or at december  compared to december  net income for was million  of which million was returned to shareholders in the form of declared dividends

discontinued operations 

the income from continuing operations presented above is not representative of what the results of first defiance would have been without the leader because of a number of factors  especially the allocation of capital between the leader and the other operating units of first defiance 
income from continuing operations for first defiance as presented above are materially impacted by the banking relationship between first federal and the leader which existed throughout the three year period presented 
it is estimated that first federal incurred an after tax loss of  for the year ended december  from the negative spread that existed between the financing provided to the leader and first federal s incremental cost of funds

cash earnings first defiance recorded a total of  of goodwill amortization expense in  with  associated with the leader and  associated with first insurance  of first insurance s goodwill amortization is tax deductible 
the leader goodwill  which totaled million at december   will be disposed of as part of the leader sales transaction first defiance analyzes its performance on a net income basis determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  as well as on a cash basis before amortization of goodwill and the related tax benefit of tax deductible goodwill  referred to in this analysis as cash basis results 
cash basis results and related discussions are presented as supplementary information in this analysis to enhance the readers understanding of  and highlight trends in  the company s core financial results excluding the effects of amortization of goodwill 
cash basis results should not be viewed as a substitute for net income and earnings per share as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the selected financial data presented in the following table highlights the performance of first defiance on a cash basis for each of the three years in the period ended december  the data has been adjusted to exclude the amortization of goodwill and the related tax benefit of tax deductible goodwill 
this goodwill resulted from the acquisitions of the leader and the insurance agencies which were combined to form first insurance 
all three acquisitions were recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
the amortization of goodwill does not result in a cash expense and has essentially no economic impact on liquidity and funds management activity 
cash basis financial data provides an additional basis for measuring a company s ability to support future growth  pay dividends  and repurchase shares 
the cash basis data presented in the table below has not been adjusted to exclude the impact of other noncash items such as depreciation  the provision for loan losses  and amortization of mrp and esop expense

management has not yet completed the impairment analysis for the goodwill recorded at first insurance  which totaled million at december  critical accounting policies first defiance has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of the its financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of first defiance are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of first defiance 
allowance for loan losses first defiance believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
refer to the section entitled allowance for loan losses and note  statement of accounting policies for a detailed description of the corporation s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights first defiance believes the valuations of mortgage servicing rights is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance recognizes as separate assets the value of mortgage servicing rights  whether those rights are acquired through loan origination activities or through purchase activities 
refer to the section entitled mortgage servicing rights and note  statement of accounting policies  for a detailed description of first defiance s process and methodology 
fasb deferral of fees first defiance believes that sfas no 
deferral of fees is a critical accounting policy that utilizes estimates in its preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance accounts for loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination cost by deferring the net fees  or net costs  and amortizing them as an adjustment of the related loan s yield

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what management believes to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
first defiance does not presently use off balance sheet derivatives to enhance its risk management 
first defiance monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income 
the simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed basis point shift in interest rates which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  loan and deposit volumes and rates  non maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements 
this simulation is run for both first defiance as a consolidated entity and for first federal on a stand alone basis 
with the pending sale of the leader  management believes the first federal stand alone simulation to be the more meaningful analysis 
the results of the simulation indicate that in an environment where interest rates rise basis points over a month period  using projected amounts as a base case  first defiance s net interest income would decrease by 
were interest rates to fall by basis points during the same month period  the simulation indicates that net interest income would increase by 
first defiance has increased its lending activities in the non residential real estate and commercial loan areas 
while such loans carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage lending  they tend to be more rate sensitive than residential mortgage loans 
the balance of first defiance s non residential and multi family real estate loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  the commercial loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  certain of the loans classified as adjustable have fixed rates for an initial term that may be as long as five years 
the maturities on fixed rate loans are generally less than years 
first defiance also has significant balances of consumer loans million at december  which tend to have a shorter duration than residential mortgage loans  and home equity and improvement loans million at december  which fluctuate with changes in the prime lending rate 
also  to limit its interest rate risk  first federal sells more than of its fixed rate mortgage originations into the secondary market 
historically  loans with maturities less than years had been retained in portfolio although first federal began selling its year fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market beginning in january in addition to the simulation analysis  first federal also prepares an economic value of equity eve analysis 
this analysis calculates the net present value of first federal s assets and liabilities in rate shock environments which range from basis points to basis points 
the results of this analysis are reflected in the following table for the first federal stand alone analysis 
this analysis is materially different than the first defiance consolidated analysis because of interest rate sensitivity associated with mortgage servicing rights 
december  economic value of equity as of economic value of equity present value of assets change in rates amount change change ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp  bp this analysis is based on first defiance s internal allocation of capital between first federal and the leader 
once the sale of the leader is completed  all of the capital of first defiance will be included in this analysis 
management will have an opportunity to control its interest rate risk based on how the freed up capital is redeployed 
based on the above analysis  in the event of a basis point change in interest rates as of december   first federal would experience a decrease in its economic value of equity in a rising rate environment and only a increase in its economic value of equity in a declining rate environment 
during periods of rising rates  the value of monetary assets declines 
conversely  during periods of falling rates  the value of monetary assets increases 
it should be noted that the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling rate environment 
based on the eve analysis  the decline in the economic value of equity in a rising rate environment is generally because first federal has used fhlb advances and deposits with shorter terms than the assets in which it invests 
the average duration of its assets at december  was years while the average duration of its liabilities was years 
management anticipates that it will balance the interest rate risk that exists on the balance sheet through the additions it makes to its investment portfolio after the completion of the sale of the leader 
in evaluating first federal s exposure to interest rate risk  certain shortcomings inherent in the each of the methods of analysis presented must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other types of financial instruments may lag behind current changes in market rates 
furthermore  in the event of changes in rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could differ significantly from the assumptions in calculating the table and the results therefore may differ from those presented 
forward looking information forward looking statements in this report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this report which are not historical fact are forward looking statements and they include  among other statements  the pro forma income statement and balance sheet which reflect the results of first defiance as if the sale of the leader had occurred as of january   projections about growth in the financial condition section  comments about the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and projections about interest rate simulations included in the asset liability management section 
actual results may differ from expectations contained in such forward looking information as a result of factors including but not limited to the interest rate environment  economic policy or conditions  federal and state banking and tax regulations  and competitive factors in the marketplace 
each of these factors could affect estimates  assumptions  uncertainties and risks considered in the development of forward looking information and could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectation regarding future performance
