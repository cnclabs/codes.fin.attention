overview worthington industries  inc is a diversified steel processor that focuses on value added steel processing and metals related businesses 
as of may   we operated facilities worldwide  principally in three reportable business segments processed steel products  metal framing and pressure cylinders 
we also hold equity positions in seven joint ventures  which as of may   operated facilities worldwide 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  accrued liabilities  income and other tax accruals  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of our significant judgments and uncertainties that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
although actual results historically have not deviated significantly from those determined using our estimates  as discussed below  our financial position or results of operations could be materially different if we were to report under different conditions or to use different assumptions in the application of such policies 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are the primary areas where financial information is subject to the use of our estimates and assumptions  and the application of our judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to our accounts receivable  including the risk associated with our retained interest in the pool of receivables sold through our accounts receivable securitization ar securitization facility 
this allowance is maintained at a level that we consider appropriate based on historical and other factors that affect collectibility 
these factors include historical trends of charge offs  recoveries and credit losses  the careful monitoring of portfolio credit quality  and current and projected economic and market conditions 
general weakness in the economy over the last few years has led to bankruptcy filings by many of our customers 
as mentioned above  we specifically monitor our credit portfolio quality  which includes identification of customers that have or may potentially file for bankruptcy  and make allowance adjustments accordingly 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable totaled million and million at may  and  respectively 
while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is adequate  changes in economic conditions or any weakness in the economy could adversely impact our future earnings 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of  including other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable 
if an evaluation is required  accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from a company s asset is less than the reported value of the asset  an impairment charge must be recognized in the financial statements 
we recognized a million loss during the year ended may  fiscal  for the impairment of certain preferred stock and subordinated debt described later in the document 
effective june   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that we review goodwill at least annually for impairment based on the fair value method 
prior to june   we amortized goodwill over years using the straight line method 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and identifiable intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we use the present value technique in determining the estimated fair value of the goodwill associated with each reporting entity 
there are three significant sets of values used to determine the fair value estimated future discounted cash flows  capitalization rate and tax rates 
the estimated future discounted cash flows used in the model are based on planned growth with an assumed perpetual growth rate 
the capitalization rate is based on our current cost of capital for equity and debt 
tax rates are maintained at current levels 
our impairment testing for fiscal resulted in an impairment write off of million 
we feel our assumptions are reasonable and our goodwill carrying amounts of million and million at may  and  respectively  are properly valued 
accounting for derivatives and other contracts at fair value we use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign currency rates 
significant judgments and estimates are required to determine fair values in the absence of quoted market values 
these estimates are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances  however  the use of different assumptions could affect the estimated fair values 
restructuring reserves during fiscal  we announced a consolidation plan to improve profitability 
this plan affects each of our business segments as six facilities will be closed and two others will be restructured 
as part of the consolidation plan  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million  comprised of million for the write down of idled assets to net realizable value  million for severance and employee related costs  and million for other restructuring related items 
as of may   employee positions had been eliminated through termination and through retirement and attrition  and cash payments totaling million had been made against the severance reserve 
the estimated net realizable value of the plant and equipment being idled of million was reclassified to other current assets as assets held for sale 
we anticipate that the termination of employees and the sale of the idled plant and equipment will be substantially complete by february we periodically evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring reserves 
these estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which may be beyond our control 
actual results may differ from our estimates and may require adjustments to our restructuring reserves and operating results in future periods 
the critical accounting policies discussed herein are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for our judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements  and some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  consolidated net sales and operating income by segment and other financial information of of of in millions  except per share actual net sales change actual net sales change actual net sales net sales processed steel products    metal framing pressure cylinders other total net sales    cost of goods sold    gross margin selling  general administrative expense restructuring expense operating income processed steel products metal framing pressure cylinders other total operating income other income expense miscellaneous income expense nonrecurring loss interest expense equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates earnings before taxes income tax expense net earnings average common shares outstanding diluted earnings per share diluted fiscal includes restructuring charges of million 
of that total  amounts that relate to the operating segments are as follows processed steel products million  metal framing million and pressure cylinders million 
fiscal includes restructuring charges of million  all relating to the processed steel products segment 
our earnings for fiscal were impacted by two one time charges a million pre tax restructuring expense and a million pre tax charge to establish a reserve for the impairment of certain assets 
in addition  fiscal was impacted by a million pre tax restructuring charge for the partial shutdown of the malvern  pennsylvania  facility 
in january  we announced a consolidation plan that included the closing of six of our facilities  the restructuring of two others and a workforce reduction of employees 
the eight facilities impacted by the consolidation plan are included in our business segments as follows processed steel products  metal framing and pressure cylinders 
in our processed steel products segment  we are closing our malvern  pennsylvania  and jackson  michigan  facilities  and we are reducing overhead costs at our facility in louisville  kentucky 
the rock hill  south carolina  facility will become a metal framing location 
the current metal framing facility in fredericksburg  virginia  will be closed and its operations moved to rock hill 
in our pressure cylinders segment  we have discontinued the operations of two partnerships in itu  brazil  and we are closing a production facility in claremore  oklahoma 
this consolidation plan resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of million or million after tax 
of this pre tax charge  million represents a cash outlay for severance and employee related payments  and the remainder represents the write down of assets to their fair market value 
going forward  we estimate this plan will improve our annual operating income by at least million  despite reducing sales by approximately million 
headcount reductions and reduced depreciation will account for annual savings of approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
see note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for more information 
in addition to the restructuring charge  we recognized a million pre tax loss for the impairment of certain preferred stock and subordinated debt we received as partial payment from four acquirers when we sold the assets of our custom products and cast products business segments during the fiscal year ended may  as economic conditions have deteriorated  each of the issuers has encountered difficulty making scheduled payments under the terms of the preferred stock and subordinated debt 
the after tax impact of the impairment charge reduced net income for fiscal by million 
in february  we formed aegis metal framing  llc aegis  a joint venture with mitek industries  inc mitek 
aegis combines the manufacturing and distribution capabilities of our metal framing segment with the software  engineering and marketing functions of mitek s metal framing systems division 
we invested million plus certain of our assets for a interest in the joint venture and purchased the rollforming assets of mitek for million 
the equity method is used to account for the joint venture  as control of the critical business decisions is equally shared with mitek 
manufacturing is contracted to our metal framing segment  which manufactures and sells the product to aegis 
effective june   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminates the pooling method of business combinations while sfas no 
eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
while there was no impact from adopting safs no 
 sfas no 
increased after tax income by approximately million for fiscal see note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for more information 
we recorded a million pre tax restructuring charge during the third quarter of fiscal when we closed a portion of our malvern facility 
the result of this partial closure was a reduction in the workforce of employees and the write down to fair market value of the affected assets 
the after tax impact of this charge reduced our fiscal income by million 
this partial closure was completed by december  fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased or million to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal this decline was due to weaker demand within our processed steel products and pressure cylinders segments and lower selling prices in metal framing and processed steel products 
gross margin increased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal much of the increase was due to higher volumes during the fourth quarter  which improved gross margin by million 
in addition  direct labor and manufacturing expenses declined million  including a million reduction in utilities mainly from lower natural gas cost  a million decrease in compensation and benefits from headcount reductions  and a million decrease in repairs and maintenance expenses 
these factors increased gross margin as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs sg a decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the reduction was due to numerous factors including a million decrease in professional expenses  a million decrease in depreciation and amortization due to lower capital spending and the elimination of goodwill amortization  a million gain on the sale of an airplane  a million gain related to legal settlements  and lower travel and entertainment expenses of million 
the decrease was partly offset by a million increase in bad debt expense which  in anticipation of a settlement  included the write down of a note received from the sale of discontinued operations 
operating income decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal excluding the effects of the previously mentioned restructuring expense  operating income increased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest expense decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decline primarily was attributable to lower average debt levels due to increased use of our a r securitization facility and lower working capital requirements and lower average short term interest rates 
a r securitization facility fees  which began in november and were recorded as miscellaneous expense  increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary contributors to the decline were reduced sales and higher manufacturing expenses at wsp and increased operating expenses at acerex which led to lower margins for those joint ventures 
our effective tax rate of in fiscal was unchanged from fiscal the following provides further information on net sales and operating income by segment processed steel products 
net sales decreased or million to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal stronger demand during the third and fourth quarters was not enough to overcome the weakness in the market early in the year  resulting in reduced volumes 
in addition  selling prices declined due to lower raw material costs and a shift from direct to toll processing 
direct shipments include sales of material with a value added processing charge  while toll shipments contain only a value added processing charge on customer owned material 
excluding the restructuring expense for fiscal and fiscal of million and million  respectively  operating income increased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal improvement in the spread between direct selling prices and raw material costs increased operating income by million 
further savings were achieved through a million decrease in compensation and benefits expense mainly due to a reduction in the number of employees  a million decrease in utilities costs primarily due to lower natural gas expenses  a million reduction in professional fees  a million gain related to a legal settlement  and a million reduction in repairs and maintenance expenses 
lower volumes and higher bad debt expense partially offset these savings and reduced operating income by million and million  respectively 
the net impact of these factors was an increase in operating income as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal metal framing 
net sales decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was due to the erosion of sales prices for core building products combined with the elimination of the stainless product line in december however  price increases instituted in the fourth quarter have begun to restore pricing 
excluding the restructuring expense for fiscal of million  operating income decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the net impact of lower average selling prices and lower raw materials cost was a million reduction in operating income 
furthermore  increased costs related to the new hawaii and washington facilities contributed to a million increase in manufacturing expense 
higher volumes partially offset these decreases by million 
as a result  operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal pressure cylinders 
net sales increased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase primarily was due to strong fourth quarter sales of liquefied petroleum gas cylinders driven by new regulations in many states requiring overfill protection devices on propane tanks 
excluding the restructuring expense for fiscal of million  operating income increased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal reduced utilities expense  lower supplies expense and higher sales volumes improved operating income by million  million and million  respectively 
consequently  operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased or million to  million in fiscal from  million in the fiscal year ended may  fiscal due to lower demand within our processed steel products and pressure cylinders segments and reduced selling prices in processed steel products and metal framing 
higher volumes in metal framing partially offset these factors 
gross margin decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the majority of the decline occurred in our processed steel products segment due to lower volumes and the smaller spread between direct average selling prices and raw material costs 
these factors decreased gross margin as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal sg a expense increased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher compensation  bad debt and health care expenses 
operating income decreased or million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal excluding the effects of the previously mentioned restructuring expenses  operating income decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest expense decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal since we paid off the decs liability during the fourth quarter of fiscal  there was no comparable interest expense during fiscal in addition  we reduced short term debt see description in liquidity and capital resources 
however  higher average short term interest rates partially offset these factors 
a r securitization facility fees of million in fiscal were recorded as miscellaneous expense 
equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal higher raw material costs at twb and lower sales at wsp led to lower margins at those joint ventures 
increases in sales and operating income at the acerex and wave joint ventures partly negated the overall decline 
our effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to ongoing state and local tax planning initiatives 
the following provides further information on net sales and operating income by segment processed steel products 
net sales decreased or million to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal primarily due to the general economic slowdown  especially in the domestic automotive industry 
the decrease in net sales was principally attributable to declining direct shipments from most plants and a decrease in toll processing volume 
however  our monroe  ohio  and decatur  alabama  plants continued to increase direct volumes due to the new dry lube line and market penetration  respectively 
excluding the restructuring expense for fiscal of million  operating income decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher average raw material prices  changes in sales mix to lower margin products  and declining direct and toll processing volumes 
higher manufacturing expenses and sg a costs as a percentage of net sales resulted in operating income as a percentage of net sales of in fiscal compared to in fiscal metal framing 
net sales decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to erosion of selling prices throughout the year brought on by intense competition 
nevertheless  strong demand for building products led to higher volumes  thus offsetting much of the negative impact due to pricing 
operating income decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales volume increases were overshadowed by price competition and higher raw material costs  decreasing operating income as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal pressure cylinders 
net sales decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was the weakening demand in all product lines due to the slowing economy and stiff competition in the european market 
a strong united states dollar also resulted in lower reported sales from our international operations 
operating income decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal reductions in sales volumes and the start up of a new non refillable refrigerant production line in portugal were the major factors leading to the decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities  representing a million decrease from fiscal the decrease primarily was due to the initial sale of accounts receivable as part of the a r securitization facility in november see description below and the prior year reduction in inventory levels 
our significant investing and financing activities during fiscal included disbursing million in dividends to shareholders  spending million on capital additions  investing million in the aegis joint venture  and retiring million in long term debt 
these transactions were funded by the cash flows from our operations and million in proceeds from the sale of assets including million for an airplane and million for certain malvern assets 
capital spending during fiscal included the following million in our processed steel products segment primarily to complete the construction of the clyde  ohio  facility  million in our metal framing segment which included spending for rollforming machinery  the washington facility  and engineering software development  million in the pressure cylinders segment partly for a new hydraulic press in westerville  and million in other  mainly in our steel pallet business  to complete the installation of welding equipment 
in november  we entered into a million revolving a r securitization facility which was expanded to million in may pursuant to the terms of the facility  certain of our subsidiaries sell their accounts receivable  on a revolving basis  to worthington receivables corporation wrc  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
in turn  wrc sells  on a revolving basis  undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to independent third parties 
we retain an undivided interest in this pool and are subject to risk of loss based on the collectibility of the receivables from this retained interest 
because the amount eligible to be sold excludes receivables past due  balances with foreign customers  concentrations over limits with specific customers  and certain reserve amounts  we believe additional risk of loss is minimal 
also because of these exclusions  no discount occurs on the sale and no gain or loss is recorded  however  facility fees of million and million were incurred for fiscal and  respectively 
the book value of the retained portion approximates fair value 
we continue to service the accounts receivable 
no servicing asset or liability has been recognized  as our cost to service the accounts receivable is expected to approximate the servicing income 
as of may   a million undivided interest in this pool had been sold 
the proceeds from these sales have been used to reduce short term borrowings 
consolidated net working capital increased million from may  to million at may  the primary contributors to the increase were higher accounts receivable due to strong sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal and an increase in other current assets related to an increased current deferred tax asset  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities due to restructuring related accruals 
during may  we replaced our million revolving credit facility maturing may with million in new facilities syndicated with various banks 
the new facilities  which will be used to finance the cash requirements of our business operations  consist of a million day revolving credit agreement maturing may and a million five year revolving credit agreement maturing may there were no outstanding balances under the facilities as of may  on may   our total debt was million compared to million at the end of fiscal our debt to capital ratio of at may   was slightly improved from the ratio at the end of fiscal on july   we acquired the stock of unimast incorporated and its subsidiaries unimast for approximately million in cash and approximately million of assumed indebtedness 
we anticipate the majority of this acquisition will be funded by proceeds from assets available for sale with the remaining portion funded through our a r securitization facility 
we expect to continue to assess acquisition opportunities as they arise 
additional financing may be required if we decide to make additional acquisitions 
there can be no assurance  however  that any such opportunities will arise  that any such acquisitions will be consummated  or that any needed additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when required 
absent any other acquisitions  we anticipate that cash flows from operations and unused short term borrowing capacity should be more than sufficient to fund expected normal operating costs  dividends  working capital  and capital expenditures for our existing businesses

inflation the effects of inflation on our operations were not significant during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to various market risks 
we continually monitor these risks and regularly develop appropriate strategies to manage them 
accordingly  from time to time  we may enter into certain derivative financial and commodity instruments 
these instruments are used to mitigate market exposure and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk at may   our long term debt was comprised primarily of fixed rate instruments 
therefore  the fair value of this debt is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
we would not expect that a increase in interest rates would materially impact the fair value of our long term debt  our results of operations or cash flows absent an election to repurchase or retire all or a portion of the fixed rate debt at prices above carrying value 
foreign currency risk the translation of our foreign operations from their local currencies to the us dollar subjects us to exposure related to fluctuating exchange rates 
we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk 
however  we do make limited use of forward contracts to manage our exposure to certain intercompany loans with our foreign affiliates 
at may   the difference between the contract and book value was not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not expect that a change in the exchange rate to the us dollar forward rate would materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
commodity price risk we are exposed to market risk for price fluctuations on purchases of steel  natural gas  zinc  nickel  and other raw materials and utility requirements 
to limit this exposure  we negotiate the best prices for our commodities and competitively price our products and services to reflect the fluctuations in commodity market prices 
to a limited extent  we have entered into commodity derivative instruments cash flow hedges to hedge purchases of steel  natural gas and zinc 
at may   these positions were not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
