item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes  included herein 
we design  manufacture and market equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disordered breathing conditions  including obstructive sleep apnea 
our net revenues are generated from the sale of our various flow generator devices  nasal mask systems  accessories and other products  and  to a lesser extent from royalties and sales of custom motors 
we have invested significant resources in research and development and product enhancement 
since  we have developed several innovations to the original cpap device to increase patient comfort and to improve ease of product use 
we have been developing products for automated treatment  titration and monitoring of osa  such as the autoset t and autoset spirit flow generators 
our research and development expenses have been subsidized in part by grants and tax incentives from the australian federal government 
labhardt acquisition on november   we acquired all the common stock of labhardt ag  our swiss distributor  for total cash consideration  including acquisition costs  of million 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the results of operations of labhardt ag have been included in our consolidated financial statements from november  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of million has been recorded as goodwill 
smi acquisition on may   we acquired all of the common stock of servo magnetics incorporated smi through a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary  servo magnetics acquisitions inc  for total consideration  including acquisition costs  of million 
consideration included the issue of  shares for fair value of million with the balance of the acquisition price paid in cash 
upon consummation of the merger  the surviving corporation  servo magnetics acquisition inc  changed its name to servo magnetics inc 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the results of operations of smi have been included in our consolidated financial statements from may  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of million has been recorded as goodwill 
purchased in process research and development of  was expensed upon acquisition of smi because technological feasibility of the products under development had not been established and no further alternative uses existed 
the value of in process technology was calculated by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established  estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such products  discounting the net cash flows to present value  and applying the reduced percentage completion of the projects thereto 
the discount rate used in the analysis was and was based on the risk profile of the acquired assets 
purchased research and development projects related to electrical motor systems used in medical devices and health equipment 
key assumptions used in the analysis included gross margins of approximately 
as of the date of acquisition  new motor systems for use in these devices are expected to be completed and commercially available by fiscal these projects have estimated costs to complete totalling approximately  we believe that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangible assets were reasonable at the time of acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project revenues  development costs or profitability  or events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary from the projected results 
tax expense our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized 
to date  a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was in fiscal and was in fiscal and respectively 
during fiscal  and  our effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately and approximately 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and future effective tax rates will depend upon  numerous factors  including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a australian tax deduction is available  the level of non deductible expenses  and the use of available net operating loss carryforward deductions and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 
fiscal year ended june   compared to fiscal year ended june  net revenues

gross profit 
gross profit increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue declined in fiscal to from in fiscal the decline in gross margins reflects a change in geographical sales mix after adjusting for map sales  with a relatively higher percentage of domestic sales  which achieve lower margins  compared to international markets 
the decline also reflects that gross margins in our acquired subsidiary  map  are historically lower than the average margins achieved by our company as a whole 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million for  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was  consistent with fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the addition of personnel in sales and administration and other expenses related to the increase in our sales

income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate declined to approximately in fiscal from approximately excluding a non recurring in process research and development write down of million and restructuring charge of million in fiscal the lower tax rate was primarily due to the lowering of the corporate income tax rate in australia from to effective july  the company also benefits from a tax deduction on research and development expenditures in australia  which further reduces the effective tax rate on australian sourced income 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net revenues 
net revenues increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million or

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million for  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were steady in fiscal  compared to fiscal at

research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses remained static in fiscal at 
the dollar increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to an increase in clinical trial costs  personnel and external consultancy fees 
other income expense 
other income expense improved in fiscal to million from million for fiscal  an increase of million 
this improvement was due primarily to foreign currency gains incurred in our foreign currency hedging structures  partially offset by interest expense associated with the purchase of map 
net foreign currency gains for fiscal were million compared to net foreign currency losses of million in income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal before map acquisition charges of million for restructuring costs and in process research and development write off of million was down from for fiscal this reduction was primarily due to the reduction in australian corporate tax rates from to on july  and to additional research and development expenses in australia for which we received a deduction for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources as of june  and june   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of approximately million and million  respectively 
working capital approximated million and million at june  and june  respectively

during the year ended june  approximately million of cash was generated by operations 
capital expenditures for the year ended june  and aggregated million and million respectively 
the majority of the expenditures for the year ended june  related to the purchase of land in sydney described below  a computer system upgrade and acquisition of production tooling and equipment 
the capital expenditures in the year ended june  primarily reflected the capital expenditure of million on the company s us headquarters in poway  california in july as a result of these capital expenditures  our balance sheet reflects net property plant and equipment of approximately million at june  compared to million at june on july   we issued million in over allotments for our convertible subordinated notes issue  increasing the total amount of convertible subordinated notes then outstanding to million

the total purchase price of the notes was million  including million in accrued interest 
we recognized a gain of million  net of tax of million  on these transactions 
as at june   we had convertible subordinated notes outstanding of million 
we may from time to time seek to retire our convertible subordinated notes through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  and current or future contractual obligations of the company  if any  that may directly or indirectly apply to such transactions

the results of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between currencies 
changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated net revenue and gross profit margins from international operations 
we are exposed to the risk that the dollar value equivalent of anticipated cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage this risk through foreign currency option contracts 
we expect to satisfy all of our short term and long term liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
critical accounting principles and estimates in response to the sec s release numbers cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty obligations  impaired assets  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first in  first out method 
we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the likelihood of any material inventory write downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or rapid changes in customer demand 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our long lived assets and goodwill 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by the company 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends  significant changes in our strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  and a significant change in the economic and or political conditions in certain countries 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in  and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
provision for warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with the company s different products 
this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision 
although we engage in product improvement programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for restructuring costs 
sfas applies to costs associated with an exit activity including restructuring or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
under sfas  a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
sfas will require a company to disclose information about its exit and disposal activities  the related costs  and changes in those costs in the notes to the interim and annual financial statements that include the period in which an exit activity is initiated and in any subsequent period until the activity is completed 
sfas is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
under sfas  a company may not restate its previously issued financial statements and the new statement grandfathers the accounting for liabilities that a company had previously recorded under emerging issues task force issue the company believes that it will not have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position and liquidity of the company 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections as of april  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may   but may be adopted early 
sfas rescinds sfas and sfas  which required that all gains and losses from debt extinguishment of debt be aggregated  and if material  classified as an extraordinary item 
as a result  gains and losses from debt extinguishment are to be classified as extraordinary only if they meet the criteria set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas also requires that sale leaseback accounting be used for capital lease modifications with economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the company has elected to early adopt sfas no 
and has classified gains from the extinguishment of debt as other income in its consolidated statements of income 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for long lived assets to be held and used  sfas no 
retains the requirements of sfas no 
to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value 
further  sfas no 
eliminates the requirement to allocate goodwill to long lived assets to be tested for impairment  describes a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows  and establishes a primary asset approach to determine the cash flow estimation period 
for long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale eg assets abandoned  exchanged or distributed to owners in a spin off  sfas no 
requires that such assets be considered held and used until disposed of 
further  an impairment loss should be recognized at the date an asset is exchanged for a similar productive asset or distributed to owners in a spin off if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the company believes that it will not have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position and liquidity of the company 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as allowed under the standard  the company has adopted sfas effective july  sfas requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
with the adoption of sfas  the company reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets to make any necessary amortization period adjustments 
based on that assessment  only goodwill was determined to have an indefinite useful life and no adjustments were made to the amortization period or residual values of other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas the company has completed its initial assessment of goodwill impairment 
the results of the review indicated that no impaired goodwill currently exists 
effective july   the company adopted sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs would be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes that it will not have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position and liquidity of the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market and business risks foreign currency market risk our functional currency is the us dollar  although we transact business in various foreign currencies including a number of major european currencies  as well as the australian dollar 
we have significant foreign currency exposure through both our australian manufacturing activities and international sales operations 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options to hedge foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities and manufacturing expenditure 
the goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates on our foreign currency exposures denominated in euro s and the australian dollar 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities  and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments 
the table below provides information in us dollars on our foreign currency denominated financial assets by legal entity functional currency foreign currency financial assets aud usd eur gbp sgd nzd sek chf aud functional currency entities assets        liability   net total        usd functional currency entities assets  liability net total  euro functional currency entities assets    liability  net total    the table below provides information about our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and presents such information in us dollar equivalents 
the table summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including foreign currency call options held at june  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by contractual maturity dates for our foreign currency derivative financial instruments 
these notional amounts generally are used to calculate payments to be exchanged under the options contracts

at june   we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio containing financial instruments in which the majority have original maturities of greater than three months but less than twelve months 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates during the twelve months ended june   would have resulted in approximately million change in pretax income 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
forward looking statements this report on form k contains or may contain certain forward looking statements and information that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as estimates and assumptions made by  and information currently available to our management 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  plan  future and other similar expressions generally identify forward looking statements  including  in particular  statements regarding the development and approval of new products and product applications  market expansion  pending litigation and the development of new markets for the company s products  such as cardiovascular and stroke markets 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements reflect the views of our management at the time such statements are made and are subject to a number of risks  uncertainties  estimates and assumptions  including  without limitation  and in addition to those identified in the text surrounding such statements  those identified below and elsewhere in this report 
in addition  important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include changes or developments in social  economic  market  legal or regulatory circumstances  changes in our business or growth strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to changes in our industry or the economy generally  the emergence of new or growing competitors  the actions or omissions of third parties  including suppliers  customers  competitors and governmental authorities  and various other factors 
should any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or the underlying estimates or assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary significantly from those expressed in such forward looking statements  and there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements contained in this report will in fact occur 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties that may affect our business  financial condition or results of operations include the following our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business 
the markets for our sdb products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology 
our ability to compete successfully depends  in part  on our ability to develop innovative new products and to be the first to market with those products 
the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could result in our products becoming noncompetitive or obsolete 
additionally  some of our competitors have greater financial  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the health care industry and in the markets for our products 
industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours 
this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing 
if we are unable to develop innovative new products  maintain competitive pricing  and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors  our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 
our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home health care products and sleep clinics 
we market our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders 
we believe that home health care dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use 
for example  in the united states  when a physician at a sleep clinic prescribes the use of a product  the patient typically purchases the product from a home health care dealer 
the physician may or may not prescribe a specific brand of product 
if a specific brand is prescribed  we believe the brand prescribed depends upon the brand of product that is used in the sleep clinic 
if a specific brand is not prescribed  the home health care dealer may recommend a specific brand 
occasionally  even if the physician prescribes a specific brand  a home health care dealer may substitute a competitive product for the patient 
we have limited resources to market to the more than  us sleep clinics and the more than  home health care dealer branch locations  most of which use  sell or recommend several brands of products 
in addition  home health care dealers have experienced price pressures as government and third party reimbursement have declined for home care products  and home health care dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us 
we cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products  or that home health care dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 
the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home health care dealers and sleep clinics and to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties 
we intend to expand our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sdb as well as primary care physicians and specialists 
we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness of our products 
if we are unable to support our continued growth  our business could suffer 
we have experienced rapid and substantial growth 
as we continue to grow  the complexity of our operations increases  placing greater demands on our management 
our ability to manage our growth effectively depends upon our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business 
unexpected difficulties during expansion  the failure to attract and retain qualified employees  the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems  the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop 
if we fail to manage our growth  our business could suffer 
if we fail to integrate our recent acquisition in germany with our operations  our business could suffer 
on february   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of map located near munich  germany 
we are currently in the process of integrating our operations with those of map 
the integration requires significant efforts from each company 
we may find it difficult to integrate the operations of map 
map personnel may leave map because of the acquisition and map licensees  distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements with map  or demand amended terms to these arrangements 
additionally  our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate the two companies 
this diversion or these difficulties in integration could have an adverse impact on us 
if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations of map  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the map acquisition 
we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in non us markets  subjecting us to various risks relating to international activities that could adversely affect our overall profitability 
sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately   and of our net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately of our net revenues in the foreseeable future 
our sales outside of north america and our operations in europe  australia and asia are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our domestic operations  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs and other trade barriers  compliance with foreign medical device manufacturing regulations  reduction in third party payer reimbursement for our products  inability to obtain import licenses  changes in trade policies and in domestic and foreign tax policies  possible changes in export or import restrictions  and the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with potentially adverse effects 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings 
since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars  our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future 
we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant portion of our manufacturing costs will continue to be denominated in australian dollars 
government and private insurance plans may not reimburse patients for our products  which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products 
our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our products will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
these third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
therefore  even if a product is approved for marketing  we cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed for such product or that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or  if adequate  will not subsequently be reduced 
for example  in some markets  such as spain  france and germany  government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations 
in other markets  such as australia and the united kingdom  there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep disordered breathing related respiratory conditions 
additionally  future legislation or regulation concerning the health care industry or third party or governmental coverage and reimbursement  particularly  legislation or regulation limiting consumers reimbursement rights may harm our business 
as we continue to develop new products  those products will generally not qualify for reimbursement  if at all  until they are approved for marketing 
in the united states  we sell our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics 
we do not file claims and bill governmental programs and other third party payors directly for reimbursement for our products 
however  we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental reimbursement programs  particularly medicaid and medicare 
in particular  the federal anti kickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering or providing remuneration  directly or indirectly  to induce either the referral of an individual  or the furnishing  recommending or arranging for a good or service  for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs 
the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 
many states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti kickback law 
we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer 
these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program  including private third party payors 
these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage  coding  and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payors 
any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties  including fines 
complying with fda and other regulations is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and international regulations regarding the testing  manufacture  distribution  marketing  promotion  record keeping and reporting of our products 
in particular  our failure to comply with fda regulations could result in  among other things  recalls of our products  substantial fines and or criminal charges against us and our employees 
product sales  introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of the fda or similar foreign regulations  which could cause our sales to decline 
before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states  we must obtain fda clearance  which can be a lengthy and time consuming process 
we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the k clearance process 
we have modified some of our k approved products without submitting new k notices  which we do not believe were required 
however  if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new k notifications for modifications to our existing products  we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the k notification 
any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier  more rigorous fda examination process 
for example  in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product prior to submitting a k notice 
additionally  we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our products 
the requirements of these more rigorous processes could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance 
marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals  and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals  our sales could suffer 
we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 
off label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties 
clearance under section k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda 
we may request additional label indications for our current products  and the fda may deny those requests outright  require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance 
if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for off label use  we could be subject to fines  injunctions or other penalties 
disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability 
we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from single source suppliers 
we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or  in the alternative  that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part 
a reduction or stoppage in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components  or while we reconfigure our components for the replacement part  would limit our ability to manufacture our devices  which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability 
we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 
our intellectual property may not protect our products  and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets and non disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products  their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
we have a number of pending patent applications  and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications 
we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable 
legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving  and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims 
additionally  there may be third party patents  patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 
we face the risks that third parties will infringe our intellectual property rights  our non disclosure agreements will be breached  we will not have adequate remedies for infringement  our trade secrets will become known to or independently developed by our competitors  or any third parties will be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require us to license and pay fees or royalties in order for us to be able to market some of our products 
we are currently engaged in litigation relating to the enforcement and defense of a number of our patents 
additional litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect our proprietary rights  or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others 
the defense and prosecution of patent claims  including these pending claims  as well as participation in other inter party proceedings  can be expensive and time consuming  even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us 
if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse  we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties  could be required to obtain licenses from third parties or could be required to cease sales of the affected products 
additionally  the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country  and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved  or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 
we are subject to product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage  which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims 
we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates 
in addition  we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits 
our insurance policies have various exclusions  and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage  in which case  we may have to pay the entire amount of any award 
we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance 
insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 
a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  if any  may require us to pay substantial amounts  which could harm our business 
our business could suffer if we lose the services of key members of our management 
we are dependent upon the continued services of key members of our senior management and a limited number of key employees and consultants 
the loss of the services of any one of these individuals could significantly disrupt our operations 
additionally  our future success will depend  among other factors  on our ability to continue to hire and retain the necessary qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
we compete for such personnel with numerous other companies  academic institutions and organizations 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons 
our operating results have  from time to time  fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations may result from a number of factors  including the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  the geographic mix of product sales  the success of our marketing efforts in new regions  changes in third party reimbursement  timing of regulatory clearances and approvals  timing of orders by distributors  expenditures incurred for research and development  competitive pricing in different regions  seasonality  the cost and effect of promotional and marketing programs  and the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities  we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales will decline 
we manufacture a significant portion of our products in our facilities in australia 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
the facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters and in the event it was affected by a disaster  we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers 
although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties  such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
delaware law  provisions in our charter and our shareholder rights plan could make the acquisition of our company by another company more difficult 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our securityholders 
in particular  our board of directors is divided into three classes  serving for staggered three year terms 
because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors 
additionally  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders 
under our stockholder rights plan  we have also issued purchase rights to the holders of our common stock that entitle those holders to purchase our series a junior participating preferred stock at a discount  under certain circumstances 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 
you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states 
additionally  two of our seven directors and three of our eight officers reside outside the united states  along with all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons 
as a result  it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets  those persons or their assets 
in addition  we have been advised by our australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts 
the information contained in this section is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business or in our strategic plans
