as part of the financial reporting process  the company s management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base judgments and develop estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
historical experience and available information is used to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in the financial statements 
in addition to the significant accounting policies described in note of the consolidated financial statements  the company believes that the following discussion addresses its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for phone services operations when title transfers at the time of shipment and the price for the product has been determined 
for its on site services  the company recognizes revenues on short term projects generally projects with a duration of less than one month as the projects are completed and invoiced to the client 
revenues from long term projects are recognized according to the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  income is recognized based on a ratio of estimated costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
losses  if any  on such contracts are provided in full when they become known 
billing in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are classified as current liabilities and any costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings are classified as current assets 
accounting for judgment and estimates the company establishes reserves when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
reserves by their nature relate to uncertainties that require exercise of judgment both in accessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating any amount of potential loss 
the most important areas of judgment and estimates affecting the company s financial statements include accounts receivable collectibility  inventory valuation  pending litigation and the realization of deferred tax assets 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in the company s business model  capital strategy  economic conditions or operating performance 
the company s evaluation is based upon  among other things  assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  the company would recognize an impairment loss 
the company continually applies its best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
the company evaluates the recoverability of the goodwill attributable to each of its reporting units as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the company continually applies its best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the financial projections used to assess the fair value of each reporting unit 
restructuring the company accrues the cost of restructuring activities in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance depending upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the situation 
the company exercises its judgment in estimating the total costs of each of these activities 
as these activities are implemented  the actual costs may differ from the estimated costs due to changes in the facts and circumstances that were not foreseen at the time of the initial cost accrual 
conversion to the euro currency on january   certain members of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency  the euro 
the company conducts business in member countries 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro was between january  and june  the company has converted to the euro  as required  and believes the conversion did not materially impact its operations or financial results
