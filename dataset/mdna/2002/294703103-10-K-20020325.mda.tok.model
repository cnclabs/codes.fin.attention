the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  equity inns trust the trust  is the sole general partner of equity inns partnership  lp the partnership and at december  owned an approximate interest in the partnership 
at december   the partnership and its affiliates owned hotel properties with a total of  rooms in states the hotels 
in order to qualify as a reit  the company and the partnership cannot operate hotels 
effective january  the effective date under the federal reit modernization act the rma  the company and its affiliates terminated or assigned all existing operating leases providing for payment of percentage rent the percentage leases between the company and certain affiliates of interstate hotels corporation ihc leasing of the hotels the interstate lessees and terminated related lease guaranties with interstate hotels  llc and wyndham international  inc and entered into new percentage leases with wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries of the company the trs lessees for the lease of hotels 
the terms of the percentage leases with the trs lessees are substantially identical to the percentage leases terminated with the interstate lessees 
through december   the partnership and its affiliates continued to lease amerisuites hotels to wholly owned subsidiaries the prime lessees of prime hospitality corporation prime  with all payments due under those percentage leases guaranteed by prime 
effective as of january  the effective date  the company and its affiliates terminated the existing percentage leases between the company and the prime lessees and the related lease guarantees 
the company also entered into new percentage leases with its trs lessees for such hotels  on terms substantially identical to those of the terminated leases 
under the rma  the trs lessees are required to enter into management agreements with eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels 
on the effective date  the trs lessees entered into new management agreements for the hotels as follows promus hotels  inc promus for hotels  crestline hotels resorts  inc crestline for two hotels  and crossroads hospitality company  llc  an ihc affiliate chc for hotels 
on the effective date  the trs lessees entered into new management agreements for the amerisuites hotels with prime s subsidiaries and one of the trs lessees also entered into a new management agreement with waterford hotel group  inc waterford for the company s hotel in burlington  vermont 
rents generated by the percentage leases with the trs lessees are eliminated in consolidation  while actual operating results of all of the company s hotels leased by the trs lessees are included in the company s financial statements 
therefore  the company s consolidated results of operations with respect to the hotels managed by promus  crestline and chc from the effective date are not comparable to results 
recent developments since its inception  the company has taken steps to position itself for growth and stability 
several changes have occurred since december  which add significantly to these efforts 
these events are as follows interest rate swaps on january   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional principal amount of million 
the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on floating rate debt at a rate of  plus     or as determined by the company s percentage of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined in the loan agreement for the line of credit the percentage 
the swap agreement will expire in october debt covenant modifications in december  the company negotiated an amendment to its million secured line of credit the line of credit 
the amendment modifies certain of the financial covenants contained in the line of credit and is effective beginning in the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of the line of credit expires in october action taken as a result of rma legislation the company terminated or assigned all of its percentage leases with the interstate lessees effective january  effective january   the company terminated the remaining leases with the prime lessees 
no remuneration was exchanged for the termination of the leases 
this action was precipitated by the recent enactment of the rma  which enables reits such as the company to gain greater control of their properties by establishing taxable subsidiaries to function as lessees  with hotel management provided by independent companies 
results of operations during  the company s revenue was primarily rental income from the interstate lessees and the prime lessees 
as a result of the termination of the interstate leases  beginning in  the company s consolidated results of operations reflect hotel level revenues and operating costs and expenses for hotels previously leased to the interstate lessees and two additional hotels previously operated under management contracts 
in order to provide a clearer understanding and comparability of the company s results of operations  in addition to the discussion of the historical results  the company has presented an unaudited recap of percentage lease revenue which compares the historical results related to percentage lease revenue for the years ended december  and the company has also presented the pro forma condensed consolidated operating results of hotels not subject to third party leases for the years ended december  and the pro forma recap of operating results of the hotels not subject to third party leases for the year ended december  reflects the termination of the interstate leases as if it occurred on january   and a discussion of the results thereof compared to the company s historical results for the year ended december  because of the significant changes to the company s structure as a result of the termination of the interstate leases effective january   management believes that a discussion of the company s historical results compared to its actual results for the properties subject to the prime leases see recap of percentage lease revenue and pro forma results for the hotels not subject to third party leases see recap of operating results of hotels not subject to third party leases is meaningful and relevant to an investor s understanding of the company s present and future operations 
the pro forma adjustments to reflect the termination of the interstate leases are as follows o record hotel level revenues and expenses and eliminate historical percentage lease revenue with respect to the properties  o record the minority interest effect related to the outside ownership in the partnership  o reverse the recording in operations of the deferred lease revenue as a result of the termination of the interstate leases  and o record the tax provision attributable to the income of the trs lessees at an effective tax rate of 
the pro forma financial information does not purport to represent what the company s results of operations or financial condition would actually have been if the transactions had in fact occurred at the beginning of or to project the company s results of operations or financial condition for any future period 
the pro forma financial information is based upon available information and upon assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
the following tables separately set forth a comparison of both the company s hotels leased to the prime lessees and the hotels leased to the trs lessees

for the years ended december  and  the amounts expended exceeded the amounts required under the loan covenants 
the company has elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code 
prior to january   the company  as a reit  was not subject to federal income taxes 
under the tax relief extension act of that became effective january   the company leases its hotels to wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries that are subject to federal and state income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no   accounting for income taxes 
under sfas  the company uses the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
for example  for federal income tax purposes  a reit  and therefore the company  is required to pay distributions of at least of its taxable income to its shareholders

under the partnership agreement  the company has the option to redeem units tendered for redemption on a one for one basis for shares of common stock or for an equivalent amount of cash 
the company anticipates that it will acquire any units tendered for redemption in the foreseeable future in exchange for shares of common stock and  to date  has registered such shares so as to be freely tradeable by the recipient 
funds from operations the company generally considers funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit 
in accordance with the resolution adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
for the periods presented  depreciation and minority interest were the company s only adjustments to net income for the definition of ffo 
the company s computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments with respect to indebtedness on the hotels 
the following reconciliation of net income to ffo illustrates the difference in the two measures of operating performance for the years ended december  in thousands  except per share and unit data net income   less gain on sale of hotel properties preferred stock dividends   add minority interest depreciation of buildings  furniture and fixtures   loss on sale of hotel properties  funds from operations   add non recurring items provision for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets recurring funds from operations   weighted average number of common shares and units outstanding   inflation operators of hotels in general have the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures may limit the company s ability to raise room rates in the face of inflation 
seasonality hotel operations historically are seasonal in nature  generally reflecting higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived asset 
the statement requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale be considered held and used until they are disposed of 
the statement requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale be accounted for under the requirements of sfas no 
which requires that such assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and to cease depreciation 
sfas no 
requires a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach with situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range of possible future cash flow amounts are estimated 
as a result  discontinued operations will no longer be measured on a net realizable basis  and future operating losses will no longer be recognized before they occur 
additionally  goodwill will be removed from the scope of sfas no 
and as a result will no longer be required to be allocated to long lived assets to be tested for impairment 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently not affected by the statement s requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  all estimates are evaluated by the company s management  including those related to bad debts  carrying value of investments in hotel properties  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
all estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers and other borrowers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers or other borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment in hotels has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis of the investment in the hotel property 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company s management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if management determines that the company will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the periods such determination was made 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains  or incorporates by reference  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities act of  as amended  including  without limitation  statements containing the words believes  estimates  projects  anticipates  expects and words of similar import 
such forward looking statements relate to future events and the future financial performance of the company  and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from the results or achievement expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant of which is the fluctuation in interest rates 
at december   the company s exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates is related solely to its debt outstanding under the line of credit 
total debt outstanding under the line of credit totaled million at december  the company s line of credit bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus    or as determined by the company s percentage of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined in the loan agreement the percentage 
at december   the interest rate on the line of credit was libor at december  plus 
the company s interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable through such arrangements and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuation 
on january   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional principal amount of million 
the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the first million of floating rate debt at plus the percentage 
the swap agreement will expire in november thus  at december   the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding under the line of credit that was exposed to fluctuations in the market rate of interest 
the company s line of credit matures in november of as discussed above  the company s line of credit bears interest at variable rates  and therefore  cost approximates market value 
as of december   the fair value liability of the company s interest rate swap was approximately million 
the company s operating results are affected by changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of its borrowings under the line of credit 
if interest rates increased by basis points  the company s interest expense would have increased by approximately  based on balances outstanding during the year ended december
