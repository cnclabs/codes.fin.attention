item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we are a leading worldwide provider of services  systems and products to both the instant ticket lottery industry and pari mutuel wagering industry based on revenues 
we believe we offer our customers the widest array of some of the most technologically advanced products and services in each of these industries 
we also believe that we are the world s only fully integrated lottery service provider  offering lottery authorities on line lottery systems  instant tickets and cooperative services programs 
on september   our predecessor company  autotote corporation  completed the acquisition of sghc 
the acquisition was completed through a merger in which sghc became our wholly owned subsidiary at a cost of approximately million in aggregate merger consideration paid to sghc stockholders  plus related fees and expenses 
the acquisition has been recorded using the purchase method of accounting  and the acquired assets and liabilities have been recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the operating results of sghc s businesses have been included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of the acquisition 
our revenues are derived from two principal sources service revenues and sales revenues 
service revenues are generally earned pursuant to multi year contracts to provide instant ticket and related services and on line and pari mutuel wagering systems and services  or are derived from wagering by customers at facilities we own or lease 
we believe our service revenues are recurring in nature 
sales revenues are derived from sales of prepaid phone cards and from the sale of wagering systems  equipment  and software licenses 
prior to the sghc acquisition  we operated primarily in three business segments pari mutuel operations  venue management operations and lottery operations 
subsequent to the acquisition of sghc  we reorganized our operations into four business segments lottery group  pari mutuel group  venue management group and telecommunications products group 
our lottery group derives revenues from the sale of instant lottery tickets and related services and the sale or operation of on line lottery systems 
in  our lottery group accounted for approximately of all retail sales of instant lottery tickets in the united states 
in the instant ticket business  we typically sell our tickets for a per unit price or are paid a fee equal to a percentage of the retail value of the instant tickets sold by a state lottery 
in the on line lottery market in the united states  we are generally paid a fee equal to a percentage of all dollars wagered on lottery tickets  in international markets  we generally sell our lottery systems to the lottery operators 
on line lottery refers to a computerized system in which lottery terminals in retail outlets are continuously connected to a central computer system for the sale and validation of lottery tickets and related functions 
our lottery group provides instant tickets and related services and lottery systems 
instant ticket and related services includes ticket design and manufacturing as well as value added services  including game design  sales and marketing support  inventory management and warehousing and fulfillment services 
in addition  this division includes promotional instant tickets and pull tab tickets that we sell to both lottery and non lottery customers 
our lottery systems business is comprised of our historical lottery operations segment as well as sghc s systems business  both of which include the supply of transaction processing software for the accounting and validation of both instant ticket and on line lottery games  point of sale terminal hardware sales  central site computers and communication hardware sales  and ongoing support and maintenance services for these products 
we currently operate on line lottery systems for seven of the on line lottery authorities in the united states  and we believe we are the second largest on line lottery provider in europe 
this product line also includes software and hardware and support service for sports betting and credit card processing systems 
our pari mutuel group is a leading worldwide provider of wagering systems to the pari mutuel wagering industry  to which we also provide related race broadcasting and telecommunications services 
our pari mutuel group is comprised of the same businesses historically reported as our pari mutuel operations segment and encompasses our north american and international on track  off track and inter track pari mutuel services  simulcasting and communications services  and video gaming  as well as sales of pari mutuel systems and equipment 
we provide our systems and services to thoroughbred  harness and greyhound racetracks  otbs  casinos  jai alai frontons and other establishments where pari mutuel wagering is permitted 
we are generally paid a percentage of all racing industry wagers  or handle  processed by our wagering systems  and we receive a service fee for our satellite communications services on a per event or a monthly subscription basis 
in  our systems processed approximately of the estimated billion in pari mutuel wagering conducted in north america 
our venue management group is comprised of the same businesses historically reported in our venue management operations segment and includes our connecticut otb operations and our dutch on track and off track betting operations 
our telecommunications products group is comprised of our prepaid cellular phone card business 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of our sjc video business  which had previously been reported as a separate segment 
the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year traditionally comprise the weakest seasons for our pari mutuel wagering businesses 
as a result of inclement weather during the winter months  a number of racetracks do not operate and those that do operate often experience missed racing days 
this adversely affects the amounts wagered and our corresponding service revenues 
wagering equipment sales and software license revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions  which do not recur on an annual basis 
consequently  revenues and operating results can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales and software license revenue 
in addition  instant ticket and prepaid phone card sales may vary depending on the season and timing of contract awards  changes in customer budgets  inventory ticket position  lottery retail sales and general economic conditions 
operating results may also vary significantly from period to period depending on the addition or disposition of business units in each period 
the acquisition of sghc in and of our german pari mutuel service business in fiscal  which were both accounted for as purchases  all affect the comparability of operations from period to period see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the acquisition of sghc  we changed our fiscal year from an october year end to a calendar year end  beginning with the year ending december  effective april   we changed our corporate name from autotote corporation to scientific games corporation 
on january   we transferred the listing for our class a common stock to the nasdaq national market  and our trading symbol was changed to sgms 
critical accounting policies the sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as accounting policies critical to us revenue recognition  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and management estimates 
revenue recognition 
almost all of our revenues  except revenues earned from the sale of wagering systems  are earned pursuant to contractual terms and conditions either as a percentage of the amount wagered or when products are shipped to the customer and the customer assumes ownership of the product 
such revenues do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgements 
revenues from fixed price contracts to provide wagering systems including equipment and software licenses are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs to complete with revisions to estimated costs reflected in the period in which changes become known 
anticipated losses on fixed price contracts are recognized when the losses can be estimated 
recognition of revenue under the percentage of completion method requires us to make estimates regarding the resources required or the scope of work to be performed 
if we do not accurately estimate the extent of work to be performed  manage our projects properly or complete our contracts within the specified time period  we may experience changes in revenues and resulting reductions in margins or losses on our contracts in subsequent periods 
at the time we enter into service or sales contracts  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of our fee is due beyond our normal payment terms which may vary depending on the nature of the contract and location of the customer  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable and recognize the revenue when payments become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
for our international customers  we frequently require collateral in the form of a letter of credit for all or a portion of our fee 
if we determine collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize the revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse change in the legality of our business ventures or the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant customer 
when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow  using a discount rate equal to our weighted average cost of funds  or by a comparison to third party indications of fair market value 
at december   the net carrying value of our long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill amounted to approximately million 
on january   statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we have ceased amortizing approximately million of goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization expense of these amounts during we are now required to perform an initial impairment review of our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives by the end of the first quarter of and of goodwill by the end of the second quarter of we do not expect that our impairment review of our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate whether any transitional impairment losses associated with our goodwill will be required to be recognized 
management estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the more significant estimates made by management involve percentage of completion for contracted lottery and pari mutuel wagering systems  as discussed above  evaluation of the recoverability of assets including accounts receivable  inventories and long lived assets and the assessment of litigation and contingencies  including income taxes 
management specifically evaluates the recoverability of accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  past collection experiences with specific customers  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we do not require our customers to provide collateral for services provided pursuant to our service contracts 
for sales of equipment and wagering systems to international customers we generally require that no less than a significant portion of the amounts to be paid  be collateralized by irrevocable letters of credit 
changes in the underlying financial condition of our customers could result in a material impact to our results of operation and financial position 
our inventory consists principally of parts and finished goods to which we provide a reserve for obsolete and slow moving items 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our reserves by reviewing historical rates of scrap  on hand quantities as compared to historical and projected usage levels  orders for new equipment  and contractual requirements to service our installed base of equipment 
we record a liability pertaining to pending litigation based on our best estimate of a potential loss  if any  or at the minimum end of the range of loss in circumstances where the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties surrounding the nature of litigation and the ultimate liability to us  if any  we continually revise our estimated losses as additional facts become known 
we have a history of losses which have generated sizeable net operating loss carry forwards for both state and federal tax purposes 
we are required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to record a valuation allowance offsetting our deferred tax asset associated with these net operating loss carry forwards if we are not able to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future years to allow us to utilize some or all of the net operating loss carryforwards 
although we earned approximately million of taxable income in the us in fiscal and utilized a portion of our net operating tax loss carryforward to offset taxes which would have otherwise been due  our history of losses precludes us  at this time  from recognizing any of our tax loss carryforwards 
when we are able to demonstrate through subsequent profitable operations that it is more likely than not that we will have taxable income  we would then reverse the valuation allowance and reflect the full value of our deferred tax asset at that time 
related party transactions statement of financial accounting standards no 
 related party disclosures  requires us to identify and describe material transactions involving related persons or entities and to disclose information necessary to understand the effects of such transactions on our consolidated financial statements 
we historically have not been a party to material transactions involving related persons or entities 
we are currently part of a consortium which includes lottomatica spa  our largest equity investor  that has been awarded a contract to be the exclusive operator for instant tickets in italy 
this award has been protested and is being reviewed in the italian courts 
if the award is ratified  we expect to enter into a contract  which initially would provide for the printing of tickets and the installation of a new centralized system  along with a full complement of cooperative services 
results of operations because the acquisition of sghc in september had such a significant effect on our business and because we also changed our year end reporting date  we do not believe that a comparison of the actual results for the year ended december  to the actual results for the year ended october  is meaningful 
therefore  the following analysis of our results of operations for are being compared to the pro forma results for the year ended december   as if sghc had been acquired at the beginning of year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  year ended december  lottery group pari mutuel group venue management group telecom munications group totals in thousands service revenues sales revenues total revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization segment operating income unallocated corporate selling  general and administrative costs consolidated operating income interest expense pro forma year ended december  unaudited lottery group pari mutuel group venue management group telecommunications group totals in thousands service revenues sales revenues total revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization segment operating income unallocated corporate selling  general and administrative costs consolidated operating income interest expense revenue analysis for the year ended december   revenues of million improved million or overall as compared to the pro forma prior year  reflecting a million or increase in service revenues which was partially offset by a million or decrease in sales revenues 
the increase in service revenues in is primarily attributable to a million or increase in revenues in the lottery group of which million is attributable to a full year operation for the vermont and new hampshire lotteries and the start up of the iowa and maine lotteries in july  and million is attributable to continued solid growth in instant ticket sales and cooperative service revenues 
pari mutuel group service revenues of million were flat compared to the pro forma prior year with increases in the north american market of million being offset by lower handle in the european markets and the strengthening of the dollar 
the million decline in venue management group revenues to million in as compared to pro forma is evenly attributable to the strengthening of the dollar and to lower revenues in connecticut because of the reduced take out rate implemented by the new york racing association in july  and the loss of handle immediately following the september  attack 
the million decrease in sales revenues to million in as compared to pro forma is primarily attributable to the completion in of the extrema terminal sales contract to sisal sport italia spa this decrease was partially offset by million of new lottery related equipment sales in plus a million or increase in prepaid phone card sales reflecting the benefit from a volume growth rate partially offset by product price decreases 
gross profit analysis the gross profit earned  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  of million in the year ended december  increased million or from the pro forma prior year primarily as a result of revenue improvements and cost control measures in the lottery group 
cost control measures implemented in the pari mutuel group and the venue management group  including the restructuring of the operations in germany  france and the netherlands  also contributed to the overall improvement in margins 
in addition  similar cost control measures helped to reduce the effect of selling price reductions in the prepaid phone card business 
gross profit as a percentage of service revenues in the year ended december  increased to in the year ended december   compared to in the pro forma prior year 
this gross profit increase results primarily from revenue improvements and cost control measures across all segments of our service businesses 
gross profit as a percentage of sales revenues was in the year ended december   the same as in the pro forma prior year  reflecting a comparable mix of systems and equipment sold in the periods 
expense analysis selling  general and administrative expenses  including software development costs  of million in the year ended december  were million or lower than in the pro forma prior year primarily as a result of cost reduction programs and merger related synergies 
depreciation and amortization expense of million in the year ended december  increased million or from million in the pro forma prior year as a result of depreciation on new computer systems and terminals for the expanded domestic lottery business  depreciation on the year expansion of the alpharetta  georgia printing facility and the new leeds  united kingdom printing facility 
interest expense of million in the year ended december  decreased million from million in the pro forma prior year due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt and lower average debt outstanding during the year other expense of million in the year ended december  consisted primarily of currency translation expense  and other income of million in the pro forma year ended december  consisted primarily of interest on invested excess cash 
income tax expense we recorded an income tax expense of million in the year ended december  federal  state and foreign taxes in the year were mostly offset by the usage of existing net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of million plus the reversal of deferred tax liabilities provided in connection with the acquisition of sghc 
no current tax benefit has been recognized on the remaining value of the domestic net operating loss carryforwards in the period 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  year ended october  lottery group pari mutuel group venue management group telecommunications sjc video group totals in thousands service revenues sales revenues total revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization segment operating income unallocated corporate selling  general and administrativecosts consolidated operating income interest expense year ended october  lottery group pari mutuel group venue management group sjc video group totals in thousands service revenues sales revenues total revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization segment operating income loss unallocated corporate selling  general and administrative costs consolidated operating income interest expense revenue analysis for the year ended october   revenues of million increased overall as compared to the prior year  reflecting a million increase in service revenues which was partially offset by a million decrease in sales revenues 
the increase in service revenues in is primarily attributable to the million increase in revenues in the lottery group as a result of the acquisition of sghc in september  a full year operation for the montana lottery  and the start up of the vermont and new hampshire lotteries in july pari mutuel service revenues increased million or reflecting revenue improvements in the nasrin service operation and the addition of expanded german operations in the fourth quarter of venue management group revenues in were down slightly from because increased handle related revenues in connecticut were offset by the strengthening of the dollar against our operations in the netherlands 
the million decrease in sales revenues in is primarily attributable to a million decrease in sales revenues in the lottery group due to the one time equipment sale to the montana lottery in fiscal and the sale of fewer extrema terminals to sisal sport italia spa in in addition  the pari mutuel group sales revenues declined million in primarily due to the fiscal sale of terminals to the uk tote  partially offset by fiscal systems and equipment sales to our customers in italy and chile 
these declines were offset by the addition of revenues of million for the telecommunications products group which was part of the acquisition of sghc 
gross profit analysis the gross profit earned  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  of million in the year ended october  increased million from fiscal primarily as a result of the acquisition of sghc in september  coupled with increased service revenues discussed above and cost control programs in the pari mutuel group and the venue management group 
gross profit as a percentage of service revenues in the year ended october  decreased to compared to in fiscal  primarily as a result of start up production costs associated with the new printing press and excess systems costs in the lottery group in the fourth quarter of fiscal the gross profit as a percent of sales revenues was in fiscal  an increase from the gross profit percent of in fiscal as a result of changes in the mix of equipment and systems sold  and the addition of the telecommunications products group 
lottery group gross profit of million or of revenues improved million in fiscal from million or of revenues in fiscal the improvement is attributable to the addition of the sghc instant ticket and cooperative services business coupled with the addition of a full year of operation on the montana lottery contract and the addition of the vermont and new hampshire lottery contracts since july these increases were offset by lower equipment sales revenues in fiscal plus sghc business integration costs 
in addition  the increases were impacted by the shutdown of the california plant and corresponding start up of the new press in the georgia plant in the sghc manufacturing operation 
the combination of the interrupted production and unusually high costs such as overtime and scrap  coupled with excess costs in the systems business of sghc  is estimated to have had a million negative impact on ebitda in the fourth quarter of fiscal pari mutuel group gross profit of million in fiscal or of revenues improved million from million or of revenues in fiscal this improvement primarily reflects the benefits of additional revenue in the german operations and the continued growth of the nasrin operations  plus higher equipment sales  all partially offset by lower revenues in the french operations  reduced satellite transponder bulk market sales  and higher satellite service fees due to a credit received in fiscal from our satellite provider as a result of a service interruption 
during the year  we largely completed the conversion of our satellite network to to compression but were unable to eliminate the resulting excess transponder capacity until late in the year due to market softness 
consequently an annualized saving of approximately million that was expected to contribute to profitability in fiscal did not begin until venue management group gross profit of million in fiscal or of revenues improved million from million or of revenues in fiscal this improvement primarily reflects higher handle and reduced operating costs in the connecticut otb operation  partially offset by approximately million of start up costs incurred in connection with our now discontinued german otb joint venture 
telecommunications products group gross profit of million in fiscal represents the group s results since september   following its acquisition as part of sghc 
expense analysis selling  general and administrative expenses  including software development costs  of million in fiscal were million or higher than in fiscal this increase is attributable to the addition of the sghc business  expanded german pari mutuel operations  growing domestic lottery operations in vermont and new hampshire  the million write off of the option to purchase atlantic city race course  and sghc business integration costs 
these increases were partially offset by cost reductions in nasrin and france and the absence of the sjc video business 
depreciation and amortization expense of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of sghc  coupled with the expanded domestic lottery business and the expanded german pari mutuel business 
these increases were partially offset by the absence of the sjc video business and the full depreciation of certain assets in prior periods 
interest expense of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal million of this increase is attributable to payments  in the form of warrants to purchase million shares of our class a common stock  to certain financial advisors in connection with their services in obtaining certain financial commitments  an additional million is due to the required pre funding of the new subordinated debt  and the balance is a result of higher debt levels incurred in connection with the acquisition of sghc 
other income of million in fiscal consisted primarily of interest on invested excess cash  and other expense in fiscal consisted primarily of currency translation expense 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal the increase reflects the effects of the acquisition of sghc 
income tax expense principally reflects federal alternative minimum tax  state taxes and foreign taxes  since no tax benefit has been recognized on domestic operating losses 
extraordinary items in connection with the fiscal issuance of our senior subordinated notes and the subsequent repayment of all amounts outstanding under the existing bank credit facility  we wrote off million of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the old notes and the and term loans and expensed million of call premium paid in connection with the redemption of the old notes 
there were no tax benefits recognized on the net extraordinary loss because we are currently in a tax loss carryforward position 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity  capital resources and working capital in order to finance the acquisition of sghc and refinance substantially all of our then existing indebtedness  we conducted a series of financings in september as a result  our capital structure changed significantly and  among other things  we are a significantly leveraged company 
as a result of the acquisition and debt refinancing  we have total indebtedness including capital lease obligations outstanding of approximately million at december  and had total indebtedness of million at december  we have also recorded a substantial increase in in goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the sghc acquisition and a corresponding increase in amortization expense through december  our financing arrangements impose certain limitations on our operations and our subsidiaries operations  including the maintenance of certain leverage  coverage and net worth ratios 
in march  as a result of the financial performance of sghc prior to its acquisition by us  certain transitional and operational matters occurring through december   and the timing of certain anticipated capital expenditures and associated borrowings in  management and our lenders amended certain limitations to be less restrictive 
among other changes  the credit facility was modified so that the planned step downs in fixed charge coverage ratios and leverage ratios were delayed by up to nine months through september  while we were in compliance with these covenants at december  and expect to continue to remain in compliance over the next months  no assurances can be provided that we will be able to do so or that we will be able to continue to meet the covenant requirements beyond months 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and future minimum operating lease obligations as set forth in the table below 
cash payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total within year years years after years long term debt  notes and credit facility other long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations our revolving credit facility  which expires in september  provides for borrowings up to million to be used for working capital and general corporate purpose loans and for letters of credit 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million and outstanding letters of credit of million under this facility leaving us with a total availability of million 
our ability to continue to borrow under the revolving credit facility will depend on remaining in compliance with the limitations imposed by our lenders  including maintenance of specified financial covenants 
presently  we have not sought and  therefore  do not have any other financing commitments 
our convertible preferred stock requires dividend payments at a rate of per annum 
to date  we have satisfied the dividend requirement using additional shares of preferred stock 
the terms of the convertible preferred stock provide us with the flexibility to satisfy the dividend in cash commencing on september   the date of the ninth quarterly dividend  subject to bank approval 
we expect that we will continue to make such payments in kind  accordingly  this obligation has not been reflected in the table above 
our pari mutuel wagering and on line lottery systems service contracts require us to  among other things  maintain the central computing system and related hardware in efficient working order  provide added software functionality upon request  provide on site computer operators  and furnish necessary supplies 
our primary expenditures associated with these services are personnel and related costs which are expensed as incurred and are included in operating expenses services in the consolidated statements of operations 
historically  the revenues we derive from our service contracts have exceeded the direct costs associated with fulfilling our obligations under these pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems service contracts 
we expect that we will continue to realize positive cash flow and operating income as we extend or renew existing service contracts 
we also expect that we will enter into new contracts that are accretive to our cash flow 
in addition  through advancements in technology  we are continually deploying more efficient and cost effective methods for manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers 
we expect that technological efficiencies will continue to positively impact our future cash flows and operating results 
we are not party to any other material short term or long term obligations or commitments pursuant to these service contracts 
periodically  we bid on new pari mutuel and on line lottery contracts 
once awarded  these contracts generally require significant up front capital expenditures for terminal assembly  customization of software  software and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration 
historically we have funded these up front costs through cash flows generated from operations  available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to continue to procure new contracts will depend on  among other things  our then present liquidity levels and or our ability to obtain additional financing at commercially acceptable rates to finance the initial up front costs 
once operational  long term service contracts have been accretive to our operating cash flow 
for fiscal  we anticipate that capital expenditures and software expenditures will be approximately million 
however  the actual level of expenditures will ultimately depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
the amount of capital expenditures in fiscal and beyond will largely depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
furthermore  our pari mutuel wagering network consists of approximately  wagering terminals 
periodically  we elect to upgrade the technological capabilities of older terminals and replace terminals that have exhausted their useful lives 
we presently have no commitments to replace our existing terminal base and our obligation to upgrade the terminals is discretionary 
servicing our installed terminal base requires that we maintain a supply of parts and accessories on hand 
we are also required  contractually in some cases  to provide spare parts over an extended period of time  principally in connection with our systems and terminal sale transactions 
to meet our contractual obligations and maintain sufficient levels of on hand inventory quantities to service our installed base  we purchase inventory on an as needed basis 
we presently have no inventory purchase obligations 
at december   our available cash and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  our available cash and borrowing capacities fluctuate principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  repayment of our outstanding debt and changes in our working capital position 
the decrease in our available cash and borrowing capacity from the levels at december  principally reflects the use of cash on hand to partially fund our wagering systems and other capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  in this period  we spent million for wagering systems and capital expenditures  million in software and other asset expenditures and repaid million of long term debt 
a significant portion of our cash flows from operations must be used to pay our interest expense and repay our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available to us for our operations and capital expenditures 
interest expense on our outstanding debt was approximately million for the year ended december  including approximately million of non cash charges 
approximately  two thirds of our debt is in variable rate instruments 
consequently  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a change in the interest rates associated with our variable rate debt will result in a change of approximately  per annum in our interest expense assuming no change in our outstanding borrowings 
to reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in the market interest rates and in response to the requirements of our credit facility  we entered into three interest rate swap contracts for an aggregate notional amount of million 
these interest rate swaps obligate us to pay a fixed libor rate and entitle us to receive a variable libor rate on an aggregate million notional amount of debt thereby creating the equivalent of fixed rate debt 
we have structured these interest rate swap agreements and we intend to structure future interest rate swap agreements to qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to the provisions of sfas changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments that effectively offset the variability of cash flows associated with variable rate credit facility obligations are reported as a component of stockholders equity 
these amounts are subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment of the hedged credit facility obligation in the same period in which the related interest affects operations 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs  including anticipated capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future  however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
while we are not aware of any particular trends  our lottery contracts periodically renew and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in sustaining our cash flow from operations through renewal of our existing contracts or through the addition of new contracts 
in addition  lottery customers in the united states generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with each state contract 
because of financial and economic events that have occurred this past year  such as the september attack  the bond market is experiencing unusual contraction  and we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
while we are not aware of any reason to do so  if we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  including our senior subordinated notes  on or before their maturity  or provide letters of credit or cash in lieu of performance bonds  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our revolving credit facility and our senior subordinated notes  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  sfas and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and in august the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after june  we adopted the provisions of sfas upon issuance 
sfas also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas requires  commencing january   that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized 
instead  they will be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas goodwill and intangible assets acquired by us in our business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized during the period through december  sfas requires that upon adoption of sfas  we evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill 
we also adopted sfas and  accordingly  will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment within the first interim period in accordance with sfas any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas and sfas require that we perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount as defined in sfas exceeds its fair value  we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations 
we have unamortized goodwill of approximately million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of approximately million at december   all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas and in connection with the adoption of sfas  we have evaluated our intangible assets and determined that our right to operate our connecticut otbs and our trade name with net carrying amounts of approximately million and million  respectively  at december   have indefinite useful lives and  accordingly  will not be amortized commencing january  in addition  as required by sfas  we will reclassify our employee work force intangible asset with a net carrying value of approximately million to goodwill effective january  amortization expense of these intangible assets and goodwill was approximately million for the year ended december  we have also evaluated the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets that will continue to be amortized and have determined that no revision to the useful lives will be required 
we expect to complete our initial impairment review of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives by the end of the first quarter of and of goodwill by the end of the second quarter we do not expect that our impairment review of our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas it is not practicable to reasonably estimate whether any transitional impairment losses associated with our goodwill will be required to be recognized in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  and it applies to all entities 
we are required to adopt sfas  effective for calendar year we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our future consolidated operations or financial position  as we are now constituted 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  sfas retains the requirement of opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily controlled subsidiary 
we are required to adopt sfas effective january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas for long lived assets held for sale to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas is largely unchanged from sfas the provisions of this statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities and therefore  will depend on future actions initiated by management 
as a result  we cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements with respect to future disposal decisions  if any

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes in any event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances  and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production  prepaid phone card production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs  except for personnel related expenditures 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
while we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and equity market risks as the company seeks debt and equity capital to sustain its operations 
at december   approximately one third of the company s debt was in fixed rate instruments 
we consider the fair value of all financial instruments to be not materially different from their carrying value at year end

assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in the united kingdom  germany  netherlands  france and austria 
the company s investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
accordingly  the company does not hedge these net investments 
translation gains and losses historically have not been material 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by one or more of the following i securing payment from our customers in us dollars  when possible  ii utilizing borrowings denominated in foreign currency  and iii entering into foreign currency exchange contracts 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our foreign operations is incurred in the local currencies 
we believe that a adverse change in currency exchange rates would not have a significant adverse effect on the net earnings or cash flows of the company 
we may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  anticipated revenue streams and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in high quality securities placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings 
this investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks
