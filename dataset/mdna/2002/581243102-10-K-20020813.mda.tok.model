overview mck communications is a leading provider of products that enable businesses to unleash the power of their voice communications systems by extending the functionality and applications of their business telephone systems from the main office to outlying offices  remote call centers  teleworkers and mobile employees over public and private networks  bundling with service providers to unite customer premise equipment cpe and network services to deliver new outsourced  value added pbxextension services  and bridging technology gaps between traditional and next generation nextgen applications ie  unified messaging  ip switches cpe or hosted and devices ie  ip telephones to enable enterprises ease of technology migration 
this combination enables a more open enterprise 
we market and distribute our products through an international network of distributors  resellers  equipment providers and service providers 
we are headquartered in needham  massachusetts  have a development center in calgary  canada  and maintain a sales and marketing office in the united kingdom 
from our inception in through  we were a small company based in calgary  canada that designed and marketed a number of niche  voice products targeted at the oil industry 
commencing in  we altered our business focus and began developing remote voice access products for enterprise telephone systems by using the technology derived from this initial business 
these efforts led to the development of our extender product line 
during the period from through  our operating activities related primarily to establishing a research and development organization  developing and testing prototype designs  and developing our initial oem relationships 
we shipped our first remote voice access product  the extender  in from until  we focused our research and development efforts on developing additional single user remote voice access products and their product enhancements as well as our initial multi user products for use in branch offices 
in addition  we established a product validation laboratory  built international indirect sales channels  developed additional technology relationships  and established our sales  marketing and customer support organizations 
over the last year  we have expanded our product line to include application specific gateways that support mobile and teleworking environments and a broader range of devices  expanded the range of networks supported with an emphasis on wireless networks  are adding a higher end branch product  created technologies to enable a more open enterprise and have expanded the range of protocols supported across our products including our embedded gateway product line 

table of contents through the fiscal year ended april   our revenues consisted primarily of product sales of our single user remote voice access products and  to a lesser degree  our recording interface gateways products 
in april  we released our first multi user remote voice access products  the extender for branch offices and the pbxgateway  and subsequently expanded the range of networks support 
for the foreseeable future  we anticipate that most of our revenues will be attributable to sales of our access and gateway products  with sales of recording interface gateways continuing to represent a consistently lower percentage of our revenues 
among our access and gateway products  we believe that the multi user products and next generation single user gateways and clients will represent a substantial and increasing percentage of our revenues  while the sales of our traditional single user products may decline as a percentage of our revenues 
in fiscal year  our traditional single user products comprised approximately of revenues  our multi user products approximately of revenues  our pbxgateways contributed approximately and our recording interfaces and other miscellaneous products contributed the remainder 
to date we have generated minimal service and maintenance revenues 
we do not expect maintenance or service revenues to be a significant portion of our revenues 
periodically  we have received non recurring engineering fees  although such fees have not been material to date 
for the fiscal years ended april   and  avaya formerly lucent technologies accounted for approximately   and  respectively of our revenues 
no customer accounted for greater than of our fiscal year revenues 
for fiscal year  our distributor partners collectively contributed approximately of revenues  oem partners contributed approximately  vars approximately  and teleco partners approximately 
we recognize product revenues upon shipment to the customer 
we routinely analyze and establish  as necessary  reserves at the time of shipment for product returns and allowances  which amounts  to date  have not been significant 
service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
maintenance revenues are deferred and recognized over the period of the contract 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased finished products from mack technologies and purchased subassemblies from emg and oem worldwide 
we incur additional costs to test and assemble these subassemblies for shipment to our customers 
cost of goods sold also includes certain manufacturing overhead costs  primarily facilities and related depreciation 
additionally  our cost of goods sold includes costs related to maintenance and support services provided to our distribution channels and end users through vital network services  a third party support provider 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs and contract engineering  purchased software and prototype expenses related to the design  development  enhancement and testing of our products 
as of april   research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
we will continue to enhance existing products and fund new product development initiatives targeted at growth segments of the enterprise voice arena 
we expect to hold research and development expenses proportional to revenue growth in future periods 
we expect to do likewise for our expenditures on our product validation laboratories that test the interoperability of our products with enterprise voice systems and other products 
this competency continues to be critical to our business as we develop additional products that function over circuit  packet and wireless networks in conjunction with third party voice and data equipment 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel expenses for those engaged in the sales  marketing and support of products as well as related trade show  promotional and public relations expenses 
we primarily sell our products through an indirect distribution system that includes oems and private label partners  teleco resellers including service providers  systems integrators  distributors  and vars 
our sales force and marketing efforts are primarily directed at supporting our indirect distribution channels through sales support  sales tools  marketing promotions and developing brand awareness 
our sales and marketing campaigns are designed to strengthen relationships with existing partners and selectively expand to new distribution channels by enabling them to stimulate sales of our product 
as revenues increase  we expect sales and marketing headcount and associated expenses to increase accordingly 

table of contents general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive  accounting and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will remain relatively constant during fiscal year stock based compensation expenses resulted from the granting of restricted stock and stock options to employees and directors with exercise prices per share determined to be below the deemed fair values per share for financial reporting purposes of our common stock at dates of grant 
the deferred compensation is being amortized to expense over the vesting period of the individual award or options  generally four years 
at april   deferred compensation to be amortized in future periods amounted to million 
in june  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of digital techniques incorporated holding dtih and its subsidiary digital techniques  inc dti and certain other assets for million in cash and stock valued at million 
the acquisition provided us with technologies to expand our product line  development rights to additional protocols and an expanded customer base 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we recorded goodwill and certain intangible assets resulting from the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible assets acquired 
goodwill and intangibles  net of impairment charges  will be amortized over a period of years and will impact our operating results through fiscal year other income expense  net consists of interest expense related to our subordinated debt  credit financing fees  interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses related to the effects of the canadian us exchange rate on intercompany transactions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates materially affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our policy is to recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to our customers and the fulfillment of all contractual terms and conditions  pursuant to the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission 
certain distribution partners have rights to return a contractual percentage of sales 
for sales to these partners  we defer revenue subject to return until such rights have expired 
a significant number of our contractual arrangements contain price protection provisions whereby we are obligated to provide refunds or credits for any decrease in unit prices of product in their inventory 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that the risk of uncollectibility is minimal 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of 
table of contents a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
we also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
as of april   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of  we believe our reported allowances at april   are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances which would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology communication equipment  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life projections  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
as of april   our inventory of million is stated net of inventory reserves of million 
if actual demand for our products deteriorate or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory reserves may be required 
product warranties 
our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time  generally twelve months  at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
we believe that our recorded liability at april   is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures  or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has assessed the valuation allowance based upon our estimate of future taxable income covering a relatively short time horizon given the volatility in the markets we serve and our historic operating results 
external market data is considered in this evaluation 
the availability of tax planning strategies to utilize our recorded deferred tax assets is also considered 
as of april   the deferred tax assets have been reduced by valuation allowances equal to the value of the assets 
if the company is to realize the deferred tax assets in an amount in excess of their reported net amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
similarly  if we should determine that we may be unable to realize our net deferred tax assets to the extent reported  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we can reasonably estimate these costs 

table of contents impaired assets 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets and amortizable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss for an asset to be held and used is recognized when the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  and for assets to be disposed of  is recognized when the fair value of the asset  less costs to dispose  is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the fair value of the assets is generally based on discounted estimated cash flows using an annual discount rate of 
the estimates reflect our assumptions about selling prices  production and sales volume levels  costs  and market conditions over the estimated remaining operating period  which can range from three months to over fifteen years 
if our assumptions related to assets to be held and used are inaccurate  additional write downs may be required in the future 
if estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised  the carrying amount of the related assets is adjusted  resulting in an increase or decrease to earnings 
restructuring 
we record restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of our operations  or shutdowns of specific sites 
these restructuring charges  which reflect our commitment to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with severance  site closure  legal matters  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
nonrecurring items 
it is our policy to identify as a nonrecurring item a material charge or gain that is not associated with on going operations or that is caused by unique events not reflective of our normal business activities in the period if such items individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on a specific line item in the consolidated statements of operations or have a material impact on results overall 
we believe that separately reporting such charges or gains enhances transparency and comparability of results by removing distortion that would otherwise occur 
examples of such items that have been separately identified in the past under this policy include material charges or gains resulting from asset impairments and restructuring of operations  including employee terminations  litigation not related to on going operations  and acquisition charges including those related to acquired in process research and development 
nonrecurring items are appropriately identified in the consolidated statements of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenues 
years ended april  revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of stock based compensation amortization of goodwill and other intangibles write off of in process research and development impairment of goodwill and other intangibles restructuring provision for legal settlement and fees total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net 
table of contents years ended april  loss before income tax provision benefit and dividends on redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary income tax provision benefit net loss before dividends on subsidiary redeemable preferred stock fiscal years ended april  and revenues 
revenues decreased from million for the fiscal year ended april  to million for the fiscal year ended april   a decrease of million or 
this decrease was  in part  due to a reduction in revenues from avaya formerly lucent technologies from million in to thousand in we believe the reduction in avaya revenues is directly related to a slow down in their overall business and their introduction of competitive products 
in addition  revenues from anixter ca decreased from million in to thousand in we believe that reduction in revenues from anixter ca  as well as the reduction in revenues from our oem and distributor partners was due to a slowdown in the economy which caused a reduction in capital expenditures and consequently a decrease in their demand for our products 
we will continue to work with our distribution channels to increase revenues 
however  our revenues and gross profit could be further decreased if we need to reduce our prices to remain competitive 
cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold decreased from million for the fiscal year ended april  to million for the fiscal year ended april   a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily related to the decrease in volume of units shipped 
gross profit decreased from for the fiscal year ended april  to for the fiscal year ended april  the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to the smaller revenue base over which we spread our fixed manufacturing costs and increases in inventory reserves due in large to our decision to close our operation in texas 
with the closing of our operation in texas and our shift to a subcontracting model  we expect to reduce our cost of goods sold 
however  we expect our gross profit will continue to be under pressure due to an overall weakness in the economy and increased market pressures 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased from million for the fiscal year ended april  to million for the fiscal year ended april   a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due primarily to decreases in staffing  principally from the dti development team in texas along with reductions to the staff in both our needham and calgary facilities 
for the years ended april  and  research and development expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from to primarily as a result of the reduction in revenues compared to the prior year 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million for the fiscal year ended april  to million for the fiscal year ended april   a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily due to decreases in staffing of both sales and marketing personnel to be more aligned with our decrease in revenues

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million for the fiscal year ended april  to million for the fiscal year ended april   a decrease of  or

amortization of stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of certain restricted stock awards and stock options to employees in the fiscal year ended april   we recorded deferred compensation expense of million 
the amount recorded represents the difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock for financial reporting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the 
table of contents date of grant 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally four years 
we expensed million of deferred stock based compensation in the year ended april  in the fourth quarter of the year ended april   we recorded an adjustment to reverse approximately million of stock based compensation previously recorded relating to terminated employees  which resulted in a net benefit for the year of approximately thousand 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
in conjunction with the acquisition of dtih  we recorded goodwill and certain intangible assets resulting from the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible assets acquired 
goodwill and intangibles were being amortized over a period of years 
during the years ended april  and  we recorded million and million  respectively of amortization expense related to goodwill and intangibles 
the decrease in amortization expense from the year ended april  to the year ended april  was due to the write off of goodwill and certain identifiable intangibles during the year ended april  as a result of these charges  amortization expense has been reduced from approximately million per quarter to approximately  per quarter through fiscal impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
during the year ended april   the company evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets  including intangibles related to the dtih acquisition 
we determined that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows were below their carrying value 
accordingly  we recorded a special charge of million 
these special charges relate to our million write off of goodwill and a million write down of the carrying value of certain identifiable intangibles to their estimated fair value of million at july  restructuring 
in july  we consolidated our texas operations and reduced redundant headcount in other areas of the company 
we continued to re focus our business on our core competencies and matched our staffing needs against our strategic initiatives 
the reorganization resulted in a reduction of employees or approximately of the workforce then employed 
in conjunction with this action we recorded a charge of approximately  for the costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services 
at april   approximately  had been paid and approximately  was reversed 
the restructuring was completed in and we do not anticipate any impact on future results 
in november   we undertook further restructuring actions due to the continued downturn in the economic environment and to accelerate our return to profitability 
these actions included the closure of the texas operations and personnel reductions of our needham and calgary staffs  leading to an overall reduction of employees or approximately of the workforce then employed in all functional areas 
in connection with this employee reduction  we recorded a charge of approximately million during the three months ended january  for the costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services 
at april   approximately  of the employee termination costs had been paid  approximately  had been reversed and the balance is expected to be paid out by december in addition  we recorded a provision of approximately  related to the estimated remaining lease obligations for our texas operations which will be paid out by august and recorded a charge of approximately  related to fixed assets previously used at those facilities which were abandoned 
at april  approximately  had been paid and  was reversed 
in april  we undertook further restructuring actions  again due principally to the continued economic downturn and to accelerate our return to profitability 
these actions included a reduction of employees or approximately of the workforce then employed 
we recorded a charge of approximately  for the costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services 
the employee termination costs will be paid out through october in addition  we entered into a sublease agreement for approximately  square feet of our facility in needham ma  through the remainder of the lease term of march in connection with this  we recorded a provision of approximately million related to the difference between the lease payments and sublease income which will be paid out over the remainder of the lease term of march  and the write off of certain fixed assets of approximately  
table of contents we estimate that these restructuring actions will result in a savings of approximately million in salaries and wages and million in facility related expenses on an annual basis  although due to the current economic environment  we anticipate that these savings may be offset by a reduction in revenue 
provision for legal settlement and fees 
we recorded a provision of approximately million related to a judgment against the company in favor of a former employee 
the provision includes the amount of the judgment  including interest  and associated legal fees incurred by us 
other income expense 
other income expense  consists primarily of interest income  and foreign exchange gains or losses related to the effects of the canadian us exchange rate on inter company transactions 
other income expense declined from income of million for the year ended april  to million for the year ended april   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income which decreased from for the year ended april  to million for the year ended april  this decrease was related to a reduction in cash reserves combined with reduced short term interest rates 
income tax provision 
we recorded a provision of  for the year ended april  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended april  the provision recorded for the year ended april  represents a pro rata portion of our minimum tax obligations for fiscal the benefit recorded for the year ended april resulted from a reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance which resulted from the deferred tax liability recognized as part of the dti acquisition 
fiscal years ended april  and revenues 
revenues increased from million for the fiscal year ended april  to million for the fiscal year ended april   an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the increased sales of our remote voice access products  and our multi user remote voice products in particular 
revenues for fiscal increased by approximately million due to our acquisition of dti in june of lucent technologies  a significant customer that has accounted for more than of our revenues over the past two years  divested its pbx unit into a standalone business named avaya 
revenue from avaya declined from million during the first six months of fiscal to million during the last six months of fiscal this decrease in revenue had an adverse affect on our operating results 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased from million for the fiscal year ended april  to million for the fiscal year ended april   an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily related to the increase in volume of units shipped 
gross profit decreased from for the year ended april  to for the year ended april  the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to a  write down of inventory related to the discontinuance of certain non strategic products as well as increased costs of certain components such as flash memory  general pricing pressures in the market and  to a lesser extent  start up manufacturing costs associated with our port gateway and cost reduced extender products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million for the fiscal year ended april  to million for the fiscal year ended april   an increase of million or

for the year ended april  and  research and development expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from to as a result of increased spending and lower than expected revenues in the second half of the year 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million for the fiscal year april  to million for the fiscal year ended april   an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to increases in staffing of both sales and marketing personnel  the addition of dti s sales force  the write off of  of accounts receivable due to the bankruptcy of a reseller  and  to a lesser extent  increased marketing activities in support of more diversified distribution

for the year ended april  and  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from to as a result of increased spending and lower than expected revenues in the second half of the year 
amortization of stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees prior to our initial public offering on october   we recorded deferred compensation expense of million  net of cancellations of certain options 
the amount recorded represents the difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock for financial reporting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the date of grant or cancellation

during the year ended april   we recorded million of amortization expense related to goodwill and intangibles 
write off of in process research and development 
during fiscal we allocated  of the million purchase price for the dtih acquistion and of the entrata acquisition price to in process research and development 
we did not incur any such charges in fiscal in process research and development represents ongoing acquired research and development projects which have yet to reach technological feasibility and would have no probable alternative future use 
we used independent professional valuation consultants to assess and allocate values for the dtih acquisition 
with regard to entrata  it was estimated that the non exclusive license we purchased was less than complete and would require approximately million of additional funding to integrate with our technology 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used in the valuation of these projects will be realized 
additionally  the development of our technology has inherent risks in the design of its hardware and software components  the manufacture of the product  and the development of a marketplace to sell the product 
if we experience problems or delays in designing or manufacturing the product or should the market not develop for our products it could affect or prevent us from achieving commercial success 
after evaluation of technology and market opportunities  the company decided not to develop products relating to the entrata technology 
restructuring 
during march we reorganized various operating functions of our business  re focused our business on our core competencies and matched staffing needs to our strategic initiatives

interest expense  offset by interest income  improved from income of  for the fiscal year ended april  to income of million for the fiscal year ended april  this improvement was primarily related to interest earned on invested cash and the repayment of our subordinated debt 
foreign exchange losses for the fiscal year ended april  were  compared to a loss of  for the fiscal year ended april  losses were primarily related to a weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar 

table of contents income tax provision benefit 
the company recorded a income tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended april  compared to a provision of  for the fiscal year ended april  the benefit primarily resulted from a reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which resulted from the deferred tax liabilities recognized as part of the dtih acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
this represents a decrease in cash and equivalents and short term investments of million compared to april  we regularly invest excess funds in short term money market funds  commercial paper  and government and non government debt securities 
these investments are designed to provide current income to the company without exposing the principal to significant risk 
net cash used in operating activities was million in the fiscal year ended april   compared with net cash used in operating activities of million in the fiscal year ended april  and net cash provided by operating activities of million in the fiscal year ended april  cash used in operating activities in the fiscal year ended april  was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues in the period 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in the fiscal year ended april   compared with net cash used in investing activities of million in the fiscal year ended april  and million in the fiscal year ended april  net cash provided by investing activities in the fiscal year ended april  was used primarily to fund operating expenses

we expect to devote our capital resources to continue our research and development efforts to prudently enhance our existing products and fund new product development initiatives targeted at the growing telephony applications in business markets  to hire and expand our sales  support  marketing and product management organizations  to expand marketing programs and for other general corporate activities 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products 
we believe that our current cash and equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months

disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily consist of interest sensitive securities with weighted average maturities of less than six months 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair value of these investments due mainly to the short term nature of these investments 
however  a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our net loss by approximately  foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we primarily sell our products in us dollars and therefore we are not generally exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
however  our canadian subsidiary sells products to canadian customers that it invoices in canadian dollars 
in the fiscal year ended april   this revenue accounted for of revenues 
transactions with our canadian subsidiary  whose functional currency is the canadian dollar  present us with foreign currency exchange risk 
the principal transactions are buying and selling of inventory 
the intercompany balance is denominated in us dollars and changes in the foreign currency exchange rate result in foreign currency gains and losses 
using the intercompany balance at april   a strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately  to date foreign exchange gains and losses have not been significant 
transactions with our united kingdom office  whose functional currency is the british pound have not been significant and have not had a material impact on our operations 
all sales outside of north america are denominated in us dollars and are not generally exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
at april  we did not own any equity investments 
therefore  we did not have any direct equity price risk 
factors affecting future operating results and stock price we are exposed to general economic and worldwide political conditions as a result of unfavorable economic conditions  the effects of war and acts of terrorism  reduced capital spending by our enterprise end users  and the need of our indirect channel partners to hold less inventory to satisfy customer demand  our sales declined significantly in the second half of our fiscal year ended april  and first half of our fiscal year ended april  this economic downtown has resulted in longer selling cycles for new equipment purchases 
we believe that our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed if current economic conditions do not improve 
specifically  as the rate at which the company s customers order its products decreases  the more likely it is that current inventories will be exposed to technological obsolescence  thus requiring the company to reduce the value of that inventory on the balance sheet 
additionally  the slow down may impact our customers ability to pay for products previously shipped which would require us to write off the associated receivables against earnings or take products back in return 
we may be materially and adversely affected by continued reductions in spending on telecommunications infrastructure by our customers 
a continued slowdown in capital spending by enterprises may affect our revenues more than we currently expect 
moreover  the significant slowdown in it capital spending has created uncertainty as to market demand 
as a result  revenues and operating results for a particular period can be difficult to predict 
in 
table of contents addition  there can be no certainty as to the severity or duration of the current industry adjustment 
as a result of the recent changes in industry and market conditions  many end user customers have reduced their capital spending on telecommunications infrastructure 
our revenues and operating results have been and are expected to continue to be materially and adversely affected by the continued reductions in capital spending on telecommunications infrastructure by existing and potential customers 
we derive almost all of our revenues from a small number of customers and our revenues may decline significantly if any major customer cancels or delays a purchase of our products we have historically derived the majority of our revenues from a small number of customers  most of whom resell our products to end users 
our failure to generate as much revenue as expected from these customers or the failure of these customers to purchase our products would seriously harm our business 
none of our customers is obligated to purchase additional products or services 
accordingly  present and future customers may terminate their purchasing arrangements with us or significantly reduce or delay their orders 
any termination  change  reduction or delay in orders could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base  our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and size of future purchases by our customers and  in particular market strategies of these customers the product requirements of these customers the financial and operational success of these customers the success of the underlying products and services that our products support 
the loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers  even if only temporary  could reduce or delay our recognition of revenues  harm our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow  and  as a consequence  could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to develop and maintain relationships with key pbx and kts system vendors would harm our ability to sustain and grow our business our success depends to a significant degree upon our relationships with leading enterprise voice vendors like alcatel  avaya  ericsson  iwatsu  infrontia formerly known as nitsuko  nortel  nec  panasonic and toshiba  among others and their associated channel distribution partners 
the systems sold by these vendors account for approximately confirm of the us market for voice equipment sales  and substantially all of our revenues for the fiscal year ended april  were attributable to products which interoperate with enterprise voice systems offered by these vendors 
given that our products interface with a broad range of switches  if we have difficulty in implementing these interfaces on new products  it could delay growing new revenues 
furthermore  we may not have access in the future to the switch specific protocols for the major telephone systems marketed by those vendors  which access may be essential to ensure the continued interoperability of our products 
moreover  we may not be able to develop products that interoperate with the voice systems offered by other vendors 
additionally  the standards for telephony equipment and data networks are evolving and our products may not be compatible with any new technology standards that may emerge 
if we are unable to provide our customers with interoperable solutions  they may make purchases from vendors who provide the requisite product interoperability 
this could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we currently have varying distribution  marketing and development arrangements with the vendors noted above 
there is no assurance that we will continue to enjoy the support and cooperation that we have historically experienced from these parties or their associated distribution channels 
also  there is no certainty that these parties will continue to offer mck s products in their sales portfolio 
it is possible that these vendors may seek to offer broader product lines and solutions that are competitive with our products 
in 
table of contents addition  they may change their distribution models which could negatively impact our revenues 
furthermore  the company must correctly anticipate the price  performance and functionality requirements of the pbx and kts partners and the company must successfully develop products that meet oem requirements and make these products available on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities in order to sustain and grow our business 
if we fail to develop and expand our indirect distribution channels  our business could suffer our product distribution strategy focuses primarily on strengthening our relationships with our distribution partners and developing and maintaining our relationships with pbx and kts system vendors  value added resellers  distributors  and telecom resellers and nextgen service providers 
if we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant indirect distribution channels  or if these distribution channels are not successful in their sales efforts  our product sales may decrease and our operating results may suffer 
many of our indirect distribution channels also sell products that compete with our products  and none of our strategic or reseller arrangements are exclusive 
in addition  our operating results will likely fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and amount of orders from our distribution partners 
our indirect distribution channels may not market our products effectively or may cease to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
if there is consolidation in any of the company s target markets or if a small number of vendors dominate any of these markets  then the company s success will depend on its ability to establish and maintain relationships with the market leaders 
if the company does not anticipate trends in any of its markets or fails to meet the requirements of pbx and kts vendors  or if the company does not successfully establish and maintain relationships with them  then its business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
because we sell through indirect distribution channels  our visibility into end user demand is limited our product distribution strategy is focused primarily on selling to indirect distribution channels rather than selling directly to end users 
we do not typically have the primary relationship with the end users who ultimately purchase our products from our distribution partners 
we interface with our channel partners and rely on them for information 
the information we receive from our channel partners related to future demand for our products is limited 
while some provide us with forecasts  pipelines and other key end user account information  it is often not timely  can be incomplete and cannot always be relied upon for its accuracy 
as a result  it is difficult for us to clearly understand our sales pipeline and therefore our results may vary significantly from our internal targets 
furthermore  if our partners change their purchasing criteria  buying habits and or inventory policies it will have a significant impact on the company s business results 
unless we are able to keep pace with the rapidly changing product requirements of our customers  we will not be able to sustain or grow our business the business communications market is characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements  frequent new product introductions  intense competition and economic uncertainty 
we believe our future success will largely depend on our ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands in growing segments 
our customers could purchase competitive products from other suppliers if we fail to produce technologically competitive products in a cost effective manner or on a timely basis 
our business is differentiated by supporting a broad range of switch  device and network types 
as new ones emerge  our growth is dependent on supporting the new and previously existing switch  device and network types 
these rapid technological advances make it difficult for our product validation and test center to verify all possible environments and this may have a negative impact on our customer support  product enhancements and new product development 
this may cause us to be unable to sustain or grow our business 

table of contents if our products are not accepted by the market  our revenues will decrease market acceptance of our products is critical to our future success 
factors that may affect the market acceptance of our products include continued market acceptance of traditional pbx and kts technology delayed market acceptance of nextgen switches and applications the performance  price and total cost of ownership of our products the availability  functionality and price of competing products and technologies the efforts and success of our indirect distribution channels 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
we may experience failure or delays in market acceptance of our products 
failure of our existing or future products to maintain and achieve meaningful levels of market acceptance would reduce the amount of revenue we receive from the sale of our products 
because substantially all of our revenues are derived from sales of a small number of products  our future operating results will be dependent on sales of these products we currently derive the majority of our revenues from our product family of distributed voice equipment  and we expect that this concentration will continue in the foreseeable future 
the market may not continue to demand our products  and we may not be successful in marketing any new or enhanced products 
any reduction in the demand for our products or our failure to successfully develop or market new or enhanced products could reduce the amount of revenue we receive from the sale of our products and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  we expect our single user products  multi user products  and our recently announced family of gateway products will account for a substantial portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
factors that could affect sales of our products include the demand for distributed voice solutions the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address customer requirements product introductions or announcements by our competitors solution or price competition in our industry technological change and customer acceptance distribution changes  their business operation changes or they experience changes in their customer relationships 
intense competition in the market for enterprise voice solutions could prevent us from increasing or sustaining revenue and prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability the market for enterprise voice solutions is highly competitive 
our inability to compete effectively in this market would materially adversely affect our revenues and future profitability 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater sales and marketing  technical  manufacturing  financial and other resources  more established distribution channels and stronger relationships 
for instance  nortel networks  avaya and more recently  intel have released products which compete directly with our products 
kts vendors have announced network implementations 
non traditional vendors are offering ip or wireless based systems which are displacing legacy environments 
moreover  our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete 
realizing and maintaining technological advantages over our competitors will require a continued high level of investment in research and development  sales and marketing and customer support and may result in charges  write offs  etc 
as we transition our product line and offer products to address the needs of hybrid  converged and next generation equipment manufacturers 
due to the opportunities in and the rapidly evolving nature of the market in which we compete  additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources  including large communications equipment manufacturers  may enter our market  thereby further intensifying competition 

table of contents we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments or achieve the technological advances necessary to compete successfully with existing competitors or new competitors 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles and loss of market share  any of which would seriously harm our business and results of operations 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and these competitive pressures may seriously harm our business 
the company s ability to further reduce costs is limited by its ongoing need to invest in research and development the company s industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
if the company failed to invest sufficiently in research and development  the company s products could become less attractive to potential customers  and its business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
as a result of the company s need to maintain or increase its spending levels in this area and the difficulty in reducing costs associated with research and development  the company s operating results could be materially harmed if its net sales fall below expectations 
in addition  as a result of the need for research and development and technological innovation  the company s operating costs may increase in the future 
future consolidation in the communications equipment industry may increase competition that could harm our business the markets in which we compete are characterized by increasing consolidation both within the communications sector and by companies combining or acquiring communications assets 
this consolidation creates uncertainty as to the nature of our future competition 
for instance  a relatively small competitor that is acquired by a large telecommunications company would likely have access to greater resources than us and would accordingly be a greater competitive threat 
we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry 
increased competition and consolidation in our industry could require that we reduce the prices of our products and may result in our loss of market share  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  because we are now  and may in the future be  dependent on strategic relationships with third parties in our industry  such as pbx and kts vendors  and large distributors  any consolidation involving these parties could reduce the demand for our products and otherwise harm our business prospects 
our dependence on independent manufacturers and suppliers could result in product delivery delays we currently use two independent manufacturers  mack technologies  and oem worldwide to manufacture all of our products 
our reliance on independent manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of or interruptions in access to necessary manufacturing processes and reduced control over delivery schedules 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products and components in required volumes  we will have to identify acceptable alternative manufacturers  which could take in excess of six months 
furthermore  the use of a new manufacturer may cause significant interruptions in supply if the new manufacturer has difficulty manufacturing products to our specifications 
further  the introduction of a new manufacturer may increase the variance in the quality of our products 
in addition  we rely upon third party suppliers of specialty components and intellectual property used in our products 
it is possible that a component needed to complete the manufacture of our products may not be available to us at acceptable prices or on a timely basis  if at all 
for example  the demand for flash memory chips may be strong and lead to shortages for these components of our products 
inadequate supplies of components  or the loss of intellectual property rights  could affect our ability to deliver products to our customers 
any significant interruption in the supply of our products would result in the reduction of product sales to customers  which in turn could permanently harm our reputation in the industry 

table of contents if anything unexpected were to happen to damage the equipment in our validation laboratory our ability to develop and test our products would be restricted we currently have a state of the art validation laboratory and test center in our calgary facility in which we conduct product testing and system interoperability testing 
if the equipment in the validation laboratory were damaged due to a natural disaster or other events it would take time to recreate our unique laboratory environment and this would have a negative impact on our customer support  product enhancements and new product development 
our ability to sustain or grow our business may be harmed if we are unable to provide adequate customer support our ability to continue to grow and to retain current and future customers depends in part upon the quality of our customer support operations 
we have entered into an arrangement with a third party customer support firm to provide some of our customer support functions 
failure to offer adequate customer support  either directly or through third parties  or failure to properly integrate third party services into our customer support framework could materially and adversely affect our reputation and cause demand for our products to decline 
fluctuations in our quarterly results could cause the market price of our common stock to fall the company s period to period revenue and operating results have varied in the past and management expects they will continue to vary in the future  and any such fluctuations may cause the company s stock price to fluctuate 
accordingly  investors should not rely on the results of any past quarterly or annual periods as an indication of mck s future performance 
in future periods  the company s operating results may fail to meet or surpass the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of mck s common stock to decline  perhaps significantly 
a number of factors could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate  including  but not limited to the timing and amount of  or cancellation or rescheduling of  orders for our products  particularly large orders from our key customers our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements  and manage product transitions new product introductions and announcements  and rate of adoption reductions in the prices of products offered by our competitors  competition from new technologies our ability to sustain our technology relationships  particularly with the major pbx and kts system manufacturers  distributor partners and telecom resellers availability and changes in the prices of components provided by third parties our ability to attain and maintain production volume levels for our products excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation unpredictability of life cycles of mck s customers our ability to sustain product and customer support quality changes in our distribution partners  their operating models  and or customer relationships the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold fluctuations in demand for our products costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of technologies or businesses telecommunications market conditions and economic conditions generally our ability to hire  train  integrate and retain new personnel changes in the level of our operating expenses 

table of contents given that any one or more of these or other factors could have an adverse effect on our business  the prediction of future quarterly results is difficult and uncertain 
in addition  some of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result  we may not be able to reduce our operating costs in response to unanticipated reductions in our revenues or the demand for our products 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  volatile and investors may not be able to resell shares at or above their purchase price the trading price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as changes in general market conditions actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results announcements of technological innovations general technology or economic trends revenues and operating results failing to meet or surpass the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter changes in financial estimates by securities analysts announcements of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors additions or departures of key personnel the demand for our common stock the number of market makers for our common stock sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
such litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would reduce the amount of resources and management time focused on growing our business and improving operating results 
sales to customers based outside the united states have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues  which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations international sales represented of our revenues for the fiscal year ended april   and of our revenues for the fiscal year ended april  while we expect sales to international markets to increase as a percentage of revenues in the future  international sales are subject to a number of risks  including changes in foreign government regulations laws  and communications standards export license requirements currency fluctuations  tariffs and taxes other trade barriers difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  longer accounts receivable collection cycles difficulty in managing across disparate geographic areas 
table of contents difficulties in hiring qualified local personnel difficulties associated with enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems expenses associated with localizing products for foreign markets political and economic instability  including disruptions of cash flow and normal business operations that may result from terrorist attacks or armed conflict 
if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of our products to these foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
in addition  to the extent that general economic downturns impact our customers  the ability of these customers to purchase our products could be adversely affected 
payment cycles for international customers are typically longer than those for customers in the united states 
the foreign markets for our products may develop more slowly than currently anticipated 
also  the company s ability to expand the sale of its products internationally is limited by the necessity of obtaining regulatory approval in new countries 
we anticipate that our non canadian  foreign sales will generally be invoiced in us dollars  and we do not currently plan to engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
as we expand our international operations  however  we may allow payment in foreign currencies  and exposure to losses in foreign currency transactions may increase 
we may choose to limit any currency exposure through the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or other hedging strategies 
our future currency hedging strategies may not be successful 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property may adversely affect our ability to compete our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary technology 
any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs  and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we presently have no issued patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing copyright  trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the company expects that the use of its intellectual property will become more difficult to monitor if mck increases its international presence 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
some of our contractual arrangements provide third parties with access to our source code and other intellectual property upon the occurrence of specified events 
such access could enable these third parties to use our intellectual property and source code to develop and manufacture competing products  which would adversely affect our performance and ability to compete 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  could seriously harm our future operating results  and may not prove successful 
claims alleging infringement of a third party s intellectual property could result in significant expense to us and result in our loss of significant rights the telecommunications industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  third parties may assert patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business  and this risk may increase as the number of entrants in our market increases and the functionality of our products is enhanced and overlaps with the products of other companies 
any claims against us or any purchaser or user of our products asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents business  financial condition or results of operations 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays  disrupt our relationships with our customers or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
legal action claiming patent infringement may be commenced against us and we may not prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in patent litigation 
in the event a claim against us is successful and we cannot obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  because much of the ability of our products to interoperate with the protocols of the various pbx vendors is based upon our prior development work and or agreements with those vendors  it is possible that those vendors may assert that our products infringe their trade secrets or other intellectual property rights 
such claims may also be precipitated by the declining product sales being experienced by all of the major pbx vendors and the trend toward more open  interoperable solutions that do not favor switch specific offerings 
for example  the company recently received notification from avaya that it believed the company was improperly utilizing certain of its intellectual property in our products that interface with avaya s pbx systems and that the company may owe avaya additional royalties with respect to the sales of such products 
the company believes that these allegations are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously 
there can  however  be no assurance regarding the outcome of this matter and it is possible that other pbx vendors will make similar allegations against the company in the future 
if our products contain defects  we may be subject to significant liability claims from our customers and the end users of our products and incur significant unexpected expenses and lost sales our products have in the past contained  and may in the future contain  undetected or unresolved errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite extensive testing  errors  defects or failures may be found in our current or future products or enhancements after commencement of commercial shipments 
if this happens  we may experience delay in or loss of market acceptance and sales  certain product returns  diversion of development resources to alleviate such problems  injury to our reputation or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  because our products are designed to be deployed within business critical communications networks  we may receive significant liability claims 
our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
these limitations may not  however  preclude all potential claims resulting from a defect in one of our products 
existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate any limitation of liability provisions that are included in the company s license agreements although mck maintains product liability insurance covering damages arising from the implementation and use of our products  the terms of our insurance limit the amount and types of damages that are covered and the company does not guarantee that coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover product liability claims 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
as a result  any such claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and our business 
the adverse resolution of litigation against us could negatively impact our business we are currently a defendant in a class action lawsuit initiated on behalf of holders of mck communications  inc common shares  which seeks damages of material and indeterminate amounts  and other lawsuits in the normal course of business 
we are and may in the future be subject to other litigation arising in the normal course of our business 
litigation may be time consuming  expensive  and distracting from the conduct of our business  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and 
table of contents may not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted against mck 
we may have difficulty identifying the source of the problem when there is a problem in a network which may adversely affect the market acceptance of our products our products must successfully integrate with products from other vendors  such as circuit switched and ip pbxs  application servers  telephony sets and private and public networks 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether caused by our products or another vendor s products  may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may force us to incur significant expenses 
the occurrence of some of these types of problems may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
difficulties and financial burdens associated with acquisitions could harm our business and financial results in the past we acquired all of the outstanding stock of dti holdings  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary digital techniques  inc 
in the future we may consider selective opportunistic acquisitions of companies or businesses with resources and products or service offerings capable of providing us with additional strengths 
acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include the risk that any future acquisition  may not produce the revenue  earnings or business synergies that we anticipated  and an acquired product  service or technology might not perform as expected 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if such benefits can actually be realized 
the process of integrating acquired companies into our business may also result in unforeseen difficulties 
unforeseen operating difficulties may absorb significant management attention  which we might otherwise devote to our existing business 
also  the process may require significant financial resources that we might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
in addition  an acquisition might adversely effect the business relationships with the company s existing suppliers and customers and or those of the acquired company 
acquired company assets might become impaired as a result of technical advancements or worse than expected performance by the acquired company 
the merged company may enter markets in which mck has no  or limited prior experience 
if the recently completed acquisition or any future acquisition fails to meet our expectations or if we change the strategic focus of the company  we may decide to sell  close  or otherwise significantly reduce our investment in the acquired technologies which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if we pursue a future acquisition  our management could spend a significant amount of time and effort identifying and completing the acquisition 
to pay for a future acquisition  we might use capital stock or cash 
alternatively  we might borrow money from a bank or other lender or obtain financing on unfavorable terms 
we might incur amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets or incur large and immediate write offs 
this might include write offs related to office closures  including costs relating to termination of employees and facility and leasehold improvement charges relating to vacating premises 
if we use capital stock  our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests 
if we use cash or debt financing  our financial liquidity will be reduced  as would the funds available to fund the company s operations or to use for other purposes 
if we lose key personnel  we may not be able to successfully operate our business our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior sales  engineering and management personnel  many of whom perform important management functions and would be difficult to replace 
within the last year we have experienced significant changes to the management team including the appointment of a new chief financial officer and new sales directors 
the loss of the services of any key personnel  particularly senior leadership  sales management and key engineers  could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations  including our success in selling our recently introduced products and planned new products 

table of contents if we are unable to retain and hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully achieve our objectives we may not be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives and we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion or to support our customers and operations 
we have at times experienced  and continue to experience  difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
recruiting qualified personnel is an intensely competitive and time consuming process 
new sales personnel and engineering personnel will require training and take time to achieve full productivity 
in addition  the design and installation of telephony solutions can be complex 
accordingly  we need highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully attract and retain additional qualified personnel 
control by existing stockholders may limit your ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders and their affiliates own a significant percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquiror from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock 
provisions of delaware law and of our charter and by laws may make a takeover more difficult provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and in delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our management 
public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so  and the ability of public stockholders to change our management could be substantially impeded by these anti takeover provisions 
for example  we have a staggered board of directors and the right under our charter documents to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval  which provisions could adversely affect the holders of our common stock
