sales  marketing and support organization during  we continued to build our sales  marketing and customer support organization with a focus on delivering our products to resellers  integrators and end users 
we have sales subsidiaries and direct sales personnel in north america  south america  europe and asia pacific 
we also have resellers located in north america  south america  europe  asia pacific and the middle east 
we expect to increase the number of our sales  marketing and customer support employees in the future in order to expand our direct sales efforts to resellers and to end users 
we may not have the necessary resources to accomplish this 
it is also possible that we will not be able to establish and expand these new distribution channels successfully 
we expect to hire additional sales employees during competition for qualified sales  technical and other personnel is intense  and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees in the future 
customers our software solutions are used by customers in a wide variety of industries  including many leading global corporations and e commerce businesses 
we market and sell our products and services to end user customers through a combination of original equipment manufacturers  direct sales and indirect sales channels such as resellers  value added resellers  hardware distributors  application software vendors and systems integrators 
concentration of customers in  and  no customer accounted for more than of our net revenue 
competition the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
we compete with internal development groups within our original equipment manufacturer partners that provide storage functions to support their systems 
these internal development groups have the resources and capability to develop their own storage solutions 
some original equipment manufacturer customers are also our competitors  including compaq computer  emc  hewlett packard  ibm  microsoft and sun microsystems 
relationships between veritas and these competitors are complex 
while we may compete with them for a share of the market  they also resell our products  and in some cases incorporate our technology into their products 
we also may be involved with them in collaborative efforts to address interoperability issues and to set standards for evolving technology 
in addition  we compete with hardware and software vendors that offer data protection  hardware and software vendors that offer file system and volume management products  hardware and software vendors that offer clustering and replication products  hardware and software vendors that offer storage area networking management solutions and systems management companies that are integrating storage management functions into their platforms  and hardware and software vendors that offer network attached storage and file serving solutions 
the principal markets in which we compete are data protection  file system and volume management  clustering  replication  storage area networking and network attached storage management solutions 
our principal competitors in each of these areas  including the original equipment manufacturer customers listed above  include data protection 
commvault systems  computer associates  emc  hewlett packard  ibm and legato 
file system and volume management 
hewlett packard  ibm  microsoft and sun microsystems 
clustering and replication 
compaq computer  emc  hewlett packard  hitachi data systems  ibm  legato  microsoft  oracle  quest software and sun microsystems 
storage area networking management 
bmc software  compaq computer  computer associates  emc  ibm and network switch vendors 
network attached storage 
emc and network appliance 
the principal competitive factors in our industry include price  product functionality  product integration  platform coverage  ability to scale  worldwide sales infrastructure and global technical support 
although many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources than we do  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base  we believe we compete favorably on the basis of each of these competitive factors relative to our competitors and that our hardware independent approach to storage software gives us an advantaged position in the market 
our future anticipated growth and success will depend on our ability to develop superior products more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors  and to educate potential customers as to the benefits of licensing our products rather than developing their own products 
our future and existing competitors could introduce products with superior features  scalability and functionality at lower prices than our products  and could also bundle existing or new products with other more established products in order to compete with us 
our competitors could also gain market share by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our other competitors 
finally  because new distribution methods offered by the internet and electronic commerce have removed many of the barriers to entry historically faced by start up companies in the software industry  we expect to face additional competition from these companies in the future 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
research and development our research and development efforts have been directed toward developing new products for unix and windows  developing new features and functionality for existing products  integrating products in the existing product line and porting new and existing products to different operating systems 
our major research and development initiatives include additional integration of the full family of storage software products  including further integration of veritas volume manager  veritas file system and veritas netbackup  development of additional applications solutions  development of additional linux versions of our products  development of additional clustering products  development of additional storage area network products  localization and translation of our products to improve our ability to compete internationally  and porting of our technology to additional platforms to further our heterogeneous storage software strategy 
each of these initiatives involves technical and competitive challenges  which we may not be able to overcome successfully 
development work under original equipment manufacturer agreements we devote a substantial amount of development effort to making sure that our products work on our original equipment manufacturer customer s platforms 
this is technically challenging  and we may not succeed in our effort 
we have contractual development obligations with some of our original equipment manufacturer customers 
our agreements with emc  hewlett packard  ibm  and sun microsystems require us to commit staffing to our projects with them 
we may not have the resources necessary to perform our obligations under these agreements 
size and location of research and development group as of december   our research and development staff consisted of  employees located mainly at our mountain view  california headquarters  and our roseville  minnesota  heathrow  florida and pune  india locations 
research and development expenditures we had research and development expenses of million in  million in and million in these amounts exclude million in for stock based compensation and million in for in process research and development charges in connection with acquisitions 
we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to enhance existing products  respond to changing customer requirements and develop and introduce new products in a timely manner that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
we continue to make substantial investments in undisclosed new products  which may or may not be successful 
we may not complete these research and development efforts successfully and therefore  future products may not be available on a timely basis or achieve market acceptance 
need to hire research and development personnel we need to hire additional research and development personnel to complete new products on a timely basis and to perform our obligations to key original equipment manufacturer partners 
the market for these personnel is very competitive and we cannot assure that we can hire them on a timely basis or at all 
we may consider acquiring and purchasing technology to achieve some of our objectives  but we may not be able to accomplish this successfully 
effect of technological advances from time to time  we or our competitors may announce new products  capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of our existing products 
announcements of currently planned or other new products could cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products 
we have from time to time in the past experienced delays of up to several months due to the complex nature of software developed by us and other software developers for whose systems or applications we offer products 
we could experience delays in connection with our current or future product development activities 
any of these delays could harm our business 
proprietary rights measures we take to protect our intellectual property we regard some of the features of our internal operations  software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  contractual and other measures to protect our proprietary information 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors and corporate partners  and license agreements with respect to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
these licenses are generally non transferable and have a perpetual term 
trademarks and patents veritas is a registered trademark in the united states 
veritas software and the veritas logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the united states and other countries

we have a number of us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications  including patents and rights to patent applications acquired from the nsmg business  telebackup systems  inc  nuview  inc 
and the kernel group incorporated  that relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
while we believe that patent protection is important  any patents obtained may not provide substantial protection or be of commercial benefit to us 
it is also possible that their validity will be challenged 
employees as of december   we had  full time employees  including  in research and development   in sales  marketing  consulting  customer support and strategic initiatives and in finance and administrative services 
we expect to hire additional employees in  particularly in research and development and in sales  marketing  consulting and customer support 
we have not entered into any collective bargaining agreement with our employees  and believe that our relations with our employees are good 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon the continued service of our key employees and on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
we may not be able to retain our key employees and may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to conduct our business in the future

until december   these assets were being amortized over their estimated useful life of four years  and resulted in amortization charges of approximately million per quarter 
in  we recorded one time non cash charges of million related to the write off of in process research and development  and we also recorded a one time restructuring charge of million related primarily to costs for our duplicative facilities that we planned to vacate  of which million was reversed in as a result of lower actual exit costs than originally estimated with respect to our duplicative facilities 
in  we recorded a stock based compensation charge of million mainly related to the acceleration of certain stock options held by our former chief executive officer and we reversed million of net attorneys fees originally accrued in relation to the delaware lawsuit captioned in re seagate technology  inc shareholders litigation  which we will not have to pay as a result of a delaware chancery court ruling that approved the settlement of the lawsuit

our services revenue consists of fees derived from maintenance  technical support  consulting and training services 
original equipment manufacturer maintenance agreements covering our products provide for technical and emergency support and minor unspecified product upgrades for a fixed annual fee 
maintenance agreements covering products that are licensed through channels other than original equipment manufacturers provide for technical support and unspecified product upgrades for an annual fee based on the number of user licenses purchased and the level of service subscribed 
international sales and operations our international sales are generated primarily through our international sales subsidiaries 
international revenue  most of which is collectible in foreign currencies  accounted for approximately of our total revenue in  of our total revenue in and of our total revenue in our international revenue increased to million in from million in  and in from million in we believe that our success depends upon continued expansion of our international operations 
we currently have sales and service offices and resellers located in north america  europe  asia pacific  south america and the middle east  and a development center in india 
international expansion will require us to establish additional foreign offices  hire additional personnel and recruit new international resellers  resulting in the diversion of significant management attention and the expenditure of financial resources 
to the extent that we are unable to meet these additional requirements  growth in international sales will be limited  which would have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
seagate technology transaction on november   we completed a multi party transaction with seagate technology  which we refer to as seagate  and suez acquisition company cayman limited  which we refer to as sac  a company formed by a group of private equity firms led by silver lake partners 
the transaction was structured as a leveraged buyout of seagate pursuant to which seagate sold all of its operating assets to sac  and sac assumed and indemnified seagate and us for substantially all liabilities arising in connection with those operating assets 
we did not acquire seagate s disc drive business or any other seagate operating business 
at the closing  and after the operating assets and liabilities of seagate had been transferred to sac  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours merged with and into seagate  following which seagate became our wholly owned subsidiary and was renamed veritas software technology corporation 
we issued approximately million shares of our common stock to the seagate stockholders in exchange for approximately million shares of our common stock and certain non operating assets and liabilities held by seagate 
the transaction resulted in a decrease of approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock 
at the closing of the transaction  we recorded the non operating assets and liabilities assumed from seagate at their fair values 
in addition  we accrued million of direct transaction costs 
acquisition related costs are summarized below in millions direct transaction costs provision accrued at transaction date cash payments balance at december  cash payments reversals balance at december  in  we reversed million of net attorneys fees originally accrued in relation to the delaware lawsuit captioned in re seagate technology  inc shareholders litigation  which we will not have to pay as a result of a delaware chancery court ruling that approved the settlement of the lawsuit and the subsequent distribution of million of additional consideration to the former seagate stockholders that was paid by sac 
we anticipate that the remaining million of accrued acquisition related costs will be utilized in for the year ended december   the transaction had no impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended december   the transaction had the following significant impacts on our consolidated statement of operations reversal of acquisition and restructuring costs of million  and additional provision for income taxes of million 
considering the impacts on our consolidated statement of operations  net of tax  and the impacts of the decrease of approximately million shares of our common stock outstanding on the number of shares used in computing the net loss per share  the transaction resulted in incremental net losses per share of the year ended december  and for the year ended we expect the transaction to be accretive when we reach profitability 
as of december  and  the transaction had impacts on our consolidated balance sheet 
the impacts on our assets and liabilities were as of december  other non current assets included million of indemnification receivable from sac and million for our ownership in gadzoox networks  inc  accrued acquisition and restructuring costs included million of direct transaction costs  and deferred and other income taxes included an additional million  which was net of a deferred tax asset of million related to our ownership in gadzoox networks  inc as of december  other current assets included million of indemnification receivable from sac  other non current assets included million of indemnification receivable from sac  accrued acquisition and restructuring costs included million of direct transaction costs  income taxes payable included an additional million  and deferred and other income taxes included an additional million 
as of december  and  deferred and other income taxes payable recorded in connection with the seagate transaction totaled million and million  respectively  and related to certain tax liabilities that we expect to pay after the merger 
certain of seagate s federal and state tax returns for various fiscal years are under examination by tax authorities 
in  we recorded a reduction of million in tax liabilities and indemnification receivable from sac due to certain settlements entered into with tax authorities 
also  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million due to changes in estimates of the amount and timing of other tax liabilities for years under examination 
we believe that adequate amounts for tax liabilities have been provided for any final assessments that may result from these examinations

critical accounting policies we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies are revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  accounting for income taxes  and impairment of strategic investments 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below and under specific areas within the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operations 
in addition  please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from primarily two sources software licenses and services 
service revenue includes contracts for software maintenance and technical support  consulting and training 
we apply the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop and sop and related interpretations to all transactions to recognize revenue 
we allocate revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
for the maintenance and technical support elements  we use historical renewal rates to determine the price when sold separately 
a typical arrangement includes software licenses  software media  and maintenance 
some arrangements include training and consulting 
software licenses are sold as site licenses or on a per copy basis 
site licenses give the customer the right to copy the software on a limited or unlimited basis during a specified term 
maintenance includes updates unspecified products upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis  telephone support  and bug fixes or patches 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
training consists of courses taught by our instructors at our facility or at the customer s site 
various courses are offered specific to the license products 
training fees are based on a per course basis and revenue is recognized when the customer has completed the course 
consulting consists primarily of product installation  which does not involve customization of the software 
installation services provided by us are not mandatory 
installation can be performed by us  the customer or a third party 
consulting fees are based on a daily rate 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have fair value to allocate revenue to the maintenance  training and consulting 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from perpetual licenses is recognized upon delivery of the software license and media using the residual method in accordance with sop revenue from maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
revenue for consulting and training is recognized as the services are performed 
we define revenue recognition criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order or amendment to the written contract from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement  prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
our software is physically delivered to our customers  with standard transfer terms as fob shipping point 
if undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement  delivery is not considered to have occurred 
the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable 
the fee our customers pay for the products is negotiated at the outset of an arrangement  and is generally based on the specific volume of product to be delivered 
therefore  except in cases where we grant extended payment terms to a specific customer  the fees are considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond days from the invoice date are not considered to be fixed or determinable 
revenue from such arrangements is recognized as the fees become due and payable 
collection is probable 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to customers where we have a history of successful collection 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our review process  revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
additionally  we generally recognize revenue from licensing of software products through our indirect sales channel when the reseller  value added reseller  hardware distributor  application software vendor or system integrator sells the software products to its customers 
for licensing of our software to original equipment manufacturers  royalty revenue is recognized when the original equipment manufacturer reports to us the sale of software to an end user customer 
in addition to license royalties  some original equipment manufacturers pay an annual flat fee and or support royalties for the right to sell maintenance to the end user 
we recognize revenue from original equipment manufacturer support royalties fees ratably over the term of the support agreement 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  we defer the revenue and recognize it upon acceptance  except for government contracts  as acceptance terms are standard 
acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  for impairment when events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in facts and circumstances that we consider as impairment indicators include the following significant underperformance of our corporation relative to expected operating results  our net book value compared to our market capitalization  significant adverse economic and industry trends  significant decrease in the market value of the asset  the extent that we use an asset or changes in the manner that we use it  and significant changes to the asset since we acquired it 
when we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present for our long lived assets  excluding enterprise level goodwill  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  we would recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss would be the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
when we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present for our enterprise level goodwill  we compare our net book value to our market capitalization 
if our net book value was greater than our market capitalization  we would recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss would be  at a minimum  the excess of our net book value over our market capitalization and could affect goodwill and other long lived assets 
as of december   we had not recorded an impairment loss on our long lived assets 
we do not expect to record an impairment loss on our long lived assets in the near future 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each federal  state and international jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities  including items such as reserves and accruals not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on this assessment  establish a valuation allowance if required 
in  we determined the valuation allowance to be million based on uncertainties related to our ability to recover two main components of our deferred tax assets 
these two components are tax benefits of certain assets acquired in the nsmg acquisition and tax benefits from employee stock option activity 
future results may vary from these estimates  and at this time it is not practicable to determine if we will need to establish an additional valuation allowance and if it will have a material impact on our financial statements 
impairment of strategic investments 
we hold investments in common and preferred stock of publicly traded and privately held companies 
we make investments in development stage companies that we believe provide us with strategic opportunities  access to new technologies and emerging markets  and create opportunities for additional sales of our products and services 
we review our strategic investments quarterly to determine if there is a decline in their fair value that is other than temporary 
elements we consider in our review include the following actual or up coming rounds of financing of the investee  subsequent to our investment date  cash position of the investee and its cash burn rate  investee s ability to obtain additional financing  investee s actual operating results compared to its forecasted results  status of the investee s product development and its competitive position  investee s management experience and employee headcount growths or reductions  current industry and economic trends relevant to the business of the investee  if privately held  the market value of common stock of the investee s publicly traded competitors  and if publicly traded  the market value of the investee s common stock 
in the third quarter of  we recognized impairment losses of million on our strategic investments when we determined that there had been a decline in the fair value of our investments that was other than temporary 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected items in our statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue 
years ended december  net revenue user license fees services total net revenue cost of revenue user license fees services amortization of developed technology total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangibles stock based compensation acquisition and restructuring costs reversals in process research and development total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net interest expense loss on strategic investments loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss net revenue net revenue increased to  million in from  million in  when it increased from million in in  our total net revenue increased more slowly than expected because of a reduction in capital spending by our customers due to weaker general economic and industry conditions and due to the events of september  this reduction in capital spending may stagnate or reduce the demand for our user licenses and services until the economic and industry conditions improve significantly 
while we believe that the percentage increase in total revenue achieved in these periods is not necessarily indicative of future results  we expect total net revenue to continue to increase in our revenue is comprised of user license fees and service revenue 
user license fees 
user license fees increased to  million in from million in  when it increased from million in these increases in and were primarily the result of continued growth in market acceptance of our software products  a greater volume of large end user transactions  and increased revenue from original equipment manufacturers during the first half of the increase in was also attributable to the introduction of new products and to the acquisition of nsmg in may we market and distribute our software products both as individual software products and as integrated products suites  also referred to as application solutions 
we derive our user license fees from the sale of our core technologies  including data protection and file system and volume management products  from our emerging technologies  including cluster and replication and san products and from our application solutions  which include technologies from both our core and emerging technologies 
the user license fees from our core technologies increased to million in from million in  when it increased from million in the user license fees from our core technologies accounted for of user license fees in  in and in the user license fees from our emerging technologies increased to million in from million in  when it increased from million in the user license fees from our emerging technologies accounted for of user license fees in  in and in as a result of our research and development efforts to create additional integrated products suites and of our sales and marketing efforts to market and sell these integrated products suites  we expect the user license fees from our application solutions to increase in dollars and as a percentage of total user license fees 
the user license fees from our application solutions decreased to million in from million in  when it increased from million in the user license fees generated by application solutions are allocated between core technology and emerging technology products 
most of our application solutions include a major component of emerging technologies 
we also expect the user license fees from our emerging technology products to increase in dollars and as a percentage of total user license fees 
in and  we recorded a greater volume of large end user transactions 
for end user transactions valued at  or more  our user license fees increased to million in from million in  when it increased from million in our user license fees from original equipment manufacturers increased to million from million in  when it increased from million in the user license fees from original equipment manufacturers accounted for of user license fees in  in and in service revenue 
we derive our service revenue primarily from contracts for software maintenance and technical support and  to a lesser extent  consulting and training services 
service revenue increased to million in from million in  when it increased from million in these increases were due primarily to increased sales of service and support contracts on new licenses  renewal of service and support contracts on existing licenses and  to a lesser extent  an increase in demand for consulting and training services 
nevertheless  our service revenue was adversely affected during the third and fourth quarters of by the events of september   which caused air travel delays or cancellations and caused many companies to impose air travel restrictions  all of which resulted in our inability to visit customer sites and in our customers inability to visit our offices 
the increase in was also attributable to the acquisition of nsmg 
service revenue represented of total revenue in we expect our service revenue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million in from million in  when it increased from million in gross margin on user license fees  excluding amortization of developed technology  is substantially higher than gross margin on service revenue  reflecting the low materials  packaging and other costs of software products compared with the relatively high personnel costs associated with providing maintenance  technical support  consulting and training services 
cost of service revenue varies depending upon the mix of maintenance  technical support  consulting and training services 
we expect gross margin to fluctuate in the future  reflecting this mix and the timing differences between increasing our organizational investments and the recognition of revenue that we expect as a result of these investments 
cost of user license fees including amortization of developed technology 
cost of user license fees consists primarily of amortization of developed technology  royalties  media  manuals and distribution costs 
the amortization of developed technology is related primarily to the acquisitions of nsmg  telebackup and nuview in cost of user license fees increased slightly to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the increase in was primarily the result of the amortization of developed technology 
gross margin on user license fees was in  in  and in the increase in gross margin on user license fees in was due to the stability of the amortization of developed technology 
if we excluded the amortization of developed technology from the cost of user license fees  the gross margin on user license fees would have consistently been in  and the gross margin on user license fees may vary from period to period based on the license revenue mix  because some products carry higher royalty rates than others 
we do not expect gross margin on user license fees to increase significantly in the future 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of personnel related costs in providing maintenance  technical support  consulting and training to customers 
cost of service revenue increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in gross margin on service revenue was in  in and in the gross margin improvement in was the result of our increased productivity and higher service revenue growth due to support fees from a larger installed customer base 
we expect the cost of service revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods and we expect the gross margin on service revenue to remain stable as a percentage 
amortization of developed technology 
amortization of developed technology was million in  million in and million in these amounts mainly represent the amortization of the developed technology recorded upon the acquisition of nsmg  telebackup and nuview in the useful life of the developed technology acquired is two to four years and we expect the amortization to be approximately million per quarter 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased to  million in from  million in  and increased in from million in the and increases are explained in more details below 
the significant increase in is due largely to the acquisitions of nsmg and telebackup in because was the first full year that both acquisitions were reflected in our results and due to the integration that has taken place  it is not possible to quantify the portion of the increase in that is related directly to these acquisitions 
we believe that the percentage increase in total operating expenses in these periods is not necessarily indicative of future results 
our operating expenses include selling and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  commissions  consultant fees and other costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in as a percentage of net revenue  selling and marketing expenses increased slightly to in  and remained consistent in and at 
the and increases in absolute dollars were attributable primarily to increased sales and marketing staffing and  to a lesser extent  increased costs associated with new marketing programs 
we intend to continue to expand our global sales and marketing infrastructure  and accordingly  we expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease slightly as a percentage of net revenue 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  third party consultant fees and other engineering related costs 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the and increases in absolute dollars were due primarily to increased staffing levels associated with new hires and  to a lesser extent  costs associated with depreciation and amortization of new equipment purchased for expansion and development efforts for new technology 
as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses were in  in and in we believe that a significant level of research and development investment is required to remain competitive  and expect these expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods and will increase slightly as a percentage of net revenue 
we expect research and development expenses to fluctuate from time to time to the extent that we make periodic incremental investments in research and development 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits and fees for professional services  such as legal and accounting services 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expenses were in  and in both and the increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to increased staffing levels  and to a lesser extent  costs associated with fees for outside professional services 
the increase in absolute dollars was due to additional personnel costs  including additional personnel related to the acquisitions in the second quarter of  and  to a lesser extent  to an increase in other expenses associated with enhancing our infrastructure to support expansion of our operations 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and to increase slightly as a percentage of net revenue in the next few quarters 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million in from million in  and increased from million in these amounts mainly represent amortization of goodwill  distribution channels  trademarks and other intangible assets recorded upon the acquisitions of nsmg  telebackup and nuview in the estimated useful life of the goodwill and the other intangibles is four years 
refer to the new accounting pronouncements section for a discussion on the impacts of the adoption of sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on our financial statements 
stock based compensation 
in  we recorded million related to stock based compensation 
this charge relates primarily to the acceleration of certain stock options held by our former chief executive officer and chairman of the board  upon his resignation in  and  to a lesser extent  to options issued in a business acquisition 
acquisition and restructuring costs reversals 
in  in connection with the seagate technology transaction  we accrued million of acquisition related costs 
in  we reversed million of net attorneys fees originally accrued in relation with the delaware lawsuit captioned in re seagate technology  inc shareholders litigation  which we will not have to pay as a result of a delaware chancery court ruling that approved the settlement of the lawsuit and the subsequent distribution of million of additional consideration to the former seagate technology stockholders originally paid by sac 
in  in connection with the nsmg acquisition  we recorded a one time charge to acquisition and restructuring costs of million 
in  mainly as a result of lower actual exit costs than originally estimated with respect to duplicative facilities  we reversed million of the restructuring charge 
in process research and development 
upon the acquisition of nsmg  telebackup and nuview in  we recorded one time charges to in process research and development totaling million 
we obtained outside valuations for these acquisitions  and values were assigned to developed technology  in process research and development and other intangibles 
the fair value of the in process research and development for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project was analyzed to determine the characteristics and applications of the technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development efforts  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
the projected future cash flows from the projects under development were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects 
revenues on the projects related to in process research and development were estimated to begin in through  with the majority of the revenues occurring between and the risk adjusted discount rate applied to after tax cash flows was  compared to an estimated weighted average cost of capital of 
we believe the amounts determined for in process research and development are representative of fair value and do not exceed the amounts an independent third party would pay for the projects assumed 
the total charge for in process research and development was estimated to be million for the nsmg acquisition 
seven in process research and development projects were identified and valued  with two projects under the data protection product group that accounted for approximately of the value assigned to in process research and development 
the data protection software products provide backup and restore functions  including scheduled automated unattended data backup operations 
the remaining products identified and valued were under the application solutions and replication product groups 
the application solutions software provides scaleable solutions for managing the behavior of different types of networks worldwide from one central location and the replication software products deliver flexible and intelligent data replication for windows nt environments 
costs to complete all of the nsmg in process research and development projects were estimated to be million 
at the date of acquisition  the development of all products ranged from to complete and averaged approximately complete  with expected completion dates through december at december   all in process research and development projects related to the nsmg acquisition were completed or abandoned 
all in process research and development projects related to the telebackup and nuview acquisitions were individually insignificant and were completed or abandoned as of december  interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net increased to million in from million in  and from million in the increase was mainly due to increased amounts of interest income attributable to the higher level of funds available for investment  which were primarily from the net cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by a lower return on investment due to lower market interest rates in the increase was due primarily to increased amounts of interest income attributable to the higher level of funds available for investment  primarily from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes in august and from the net cash provided by operating activities 
interest expense 
interest expense consisted primarily of interest recorded under the convertible subordinated notes due issued in august and the convertible subordinated notes due issued in october interest expense decreased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the decrease in was due primarily to the interest expense savings that has been realized from the conversion of approximately million of the convertible subordinated notes that occurred in the third quarter of the increase in was due primarily to interest recorded for the convertible subordinated notes  since this was the first full year that these notes were outstanding 
loss on strategic investments 
with the decline in the economy in  companies have experienced extreme volatility and instability in their business and operating results 
in the third quarter of  we recognized impairment losses of million on our strategic investments when we determined that there had been a decline in the fair value of these investments that was other than temporary 
these losses represented write downs of the carrying amount of our investments and were determined by using  among other factors  a significant decline in an investee s stock value  its inability to obtain additional private financing  and the uncertainty of its financial condition 
income taxes 
we had negative effective tax rates of in  in and in our effective tax rates were negative and differed from the combined federal and state statutory rates due primarily to differences attributable to acquisition related charges that were non deductible for tax purposes 
new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas  effective in july  requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also specifies criteria intangible that assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
upon adoption of sfas on january   we evaluated our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and made necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill 
also  we reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and will make necessary amortization adjustments by march  in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas by march  any impairment loss will be measured as of the january  and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of we do not believe that sfas will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in connection with sfas s transitional goodwill impairment test  we intend to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption in a two step process as follows step we will identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we have until june  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  we will perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
if the reporting unit s fair value exceeds its carrying value  no further work is needed 
step we will compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets  both recognized and unrecognized  and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of january  this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than december  any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption  january   we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of approximately  million and unamortized other intangible assets in the amount of approximately million  all of which are subject to the transition provisions of sfas and we expect to complete the transitional goodwill impairment test by june  we do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the test  but there can be no assurance that at the time the test is completed a significant impairment charge may not be recorded 
the amortization of goodwill represented approximately million per quarter prior to the adoption of sfas we do not believe that sfas and sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or cash flows 
however  because of the implementation of sfas and sfas  we expect to become profitable in in august  fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operation reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether they were previously held and used or newly acquired  and it also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
we will be required to implement the provisions of sfas as of january  we do not believe that sfas will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb staff issued topic no 
d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred topic d 
topic d requires companies to record certain reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses as revenue instead of an offset to the related expense 
upon application of topic d  comparative financial statements for prior periods must be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this announcement 
we will be required to implement the provisions of topic d as of january  we do not believe that topic d will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  million at december  and represented of our net tangible assets 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  million at december  and represented of our net tangible assets 
cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid with original maturities of ninety days or less 
short term and long term investments consist mainly of investment grade commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities taxable and non taxable  asset backed securities and market auction preferreds 
operating activities provided cash of million in  primarily from income after adjustments to exclude non cash charges  including amortization of intangibles related to acquisition activities  tax benefits from stock plans and an increase in deferred revenue  decrease in other assets  partially offset by an increase in accrued acquisition costs 
operating activities provided cash of million in  primarily from income after adjustments to exclude non cash charges  including amortization of intangibles related to acquisition activities  tax benefits from stock plans and an increase in deferred revenue partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and other assets  as a result of our overall revenue growth

investing activities used cash of million in primarily due to the net increase in short term and long term investments of million  purchases of property and equipment of million and the purchase of certain assets of nuview 
financing activities provided cash of million in  arising primarily from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 
financing activities provided cash of million in from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 
financing activities provided cash of million in from the net proceeds of million related to the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes in august and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 
convertible subordinated notes in october  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due in the notes  for which we received net proceeds of million 
we and our wholly owned subsidiary  veritas operating corporation  are co obligors on the notes and are unconditionally  jointly and severally liable for all payments under the notes 
as of december   a total principal amount of million had been converted into approximately million shares of our common stock 
based on the aggregate principal amount at maturity of million outstanding as of december   the notes provide for semi annual interest payments of million each may and november the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events  equivalent to a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount at maturity 
on or after november   the notes will be redeemable over a period of time until maturity at our option at declining premiums to par 
the debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the notes using the interest method 
in august  we and our wholly owned subsidiary  veritas operating corporation  issued million  aggregate principal amount at maturity  of convertible subordinated notes due in the notes for which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
the interest rate of  together with the accrual of original issue discount  represent a yield to maturity of 
we and veritas operating corporation are co obligors on the notes and are unconditionally  jointly and severally liable for all payments under the notes 
as of december   a total principal amount of million had been converted into approximately  shares of our common stock 
based on the aggregate principal amount at maturity of million outstanding as of december   the notes provide for semi annual interest payments of million each february and august the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events  equivalent to a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount at maturity 
on or after august   the notes will be redeemable over a period of time until maturity at our option at the issuance price plus accrued original issue discount and any accrued interest 
the debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the notes using the interest method 
at december   we had a ratio of long term debt to total capitalization of approximately 
the degree to which we will be leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  including the notes and the notes  future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements 
if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative financing 
commitments during the third and fourth quarters of  we extended and amended the term of our million unsecured credit facility  which we hold with a syndicate of financial institutions 
at december   no amount was outstanding and the credit facility is due to expire in september borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at to over libor  and are subject to our compliance with financial and other covenants 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial covenants such as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  debt on ebitda and quick ratio  all of which we were in compliance with as of december  in and  we entered into three build to suit lease agreements for office buildings in mountain view  california  roseville  minnesota and milpitas  california 
we began occupying the roseville and mountain view facilities in may and june respectively 
the development and acquisition of the properties have been financed by a third party through financial institutions 
we have accounted for these agreements as operating leases in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases  as amended 
during the first  third and fourth quarters of  we amended our existing lease agreement  originally signed in the second quarter of  for new corporate campus facilities in mountain view  california 
the facilities  of  square feet  provide space for sales  marketing  administration and research and development functions 
the lease term for these facilities is five years beginning in march  with an option to extend the lease term for two successive periods of one year each  if agreed to by the financial institutions 
we have the option to purchase the property land and facilities for the termination value of million or  at the end of the lease  to arrange for the sale of the property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the owner for the difference between the sales price and the guaranteed residual value up to million if the sales price is less than this amount  subject to certain provisions of the lease 
in addition  we are entitled to any proceeds from a sale of the property in excess of the termination value 
we now occupy the new corporate campus facilities and began making lease payments in the second quarter of monthly lease payments under this operating lease are based on libor using day to day libor contracts 
future minimum lease payments under this lease are included in the table below 
during the first  third and fourth quarters of  we amended our existing lease agreement  originally signed in the first quarter of  for our existing facilities in roseville  minnesota 
we improved and expanded our existing facilities of  square feet and developed adjacent property adding  square feet completed in the second quarter of the facilities provide space for technical support and research and development functions 
the lease term for these facilities is five years beginning in march  with an option to extend the lease term for two successive periods of one year each  if agreed to by the financial institutions 
we have the option to purchase the property land and facilities for the termination value of million or  at the end of the lease  to arrange for the sale of the property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the owner for the difference between the sales price and the guaranteed residual value up to million if the sales price is less than this amount  subject to certain provisions of the lease 
in addition  we are entitled to any proceeds from a sale of the property in excess of the termination value 
we now occupy the new campus facilities and began making lease payments in the second quarter of monthly lease payments under this operating lease are based on libor using day to day libor contracts 
future minimum lease payments under this lease are included in the table below 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we amended our existing lease agreement  originally signed in the third quarter of  for the lease of acres of land and subsequent improvements for new research and development campus facilities in milpitas  california 
we plan to develop the site in two phases  with the first phase of  square feet being completed in the fourth quarter of the facilities will provide space for research and development and general corporate functions 
the lease term for the first phase is five years beginning in july  with an option to extend the lease term for two successive periods of one year each  if agreed to by the financial institutions 
we have the option to purchase the property land and first phase facilities for the termination value of million or  at the end of the lease  to arrange for the sale of the property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the owner for the difference between the sales price and the guaranteed residual value up to million if the sales price is less than this amount  subject to certain provisions of the lease 
in addition  we are entitled to any proceeds from a sale of the property in excess of the termination value 
we anticipate to begin the lease payments in the third quarter of for the first phase and to commence occupying the new campus facilities in the fourth quarter of monthly lease payments under this operating lease are based on libor using day to day libor contracts 
future minimum lease payments under this lease are included in the table below 
we are currently analyzing our construction schedule for the second phase of the campus  but at this time no commitments have been made with respect to the start of construction 
we have evaluated the expected fair value of the properties at the end of the lease terms by reviewing current real estate market conditions and indicators of expectations for the market in the future 
in the event that we determine it is probable that the expected fair value of any of the properties at the end of the lease terms will be less than the respective termination values  we will accrue the expected loss on a straight line basis over the remaining lease term 
currently  we do not believe it is probable that the fair market value of the properties at the end of the lease terms will be less than the termination values 
the three lease agreements listed above require that we maintain specified financial covenants such as ebitda  debt on ebitda and quick ratio  all of which we were in compliance with as of december  in addition  all the properties covered by the leases  are subject to a deed of trust in favor of the lessor in order to secure our obligations under the leases 
the future payments due under debt and the future minimum lease payments for facilities and rental equipment as of december  are operating lease notes notes commitments total and thereafter balance at december  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
after that time  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that if available  we will be able to obtain it on terms favorable to us 
factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  you should consider carefully the following factors in evaluating veritas and our business 
our revenue may fluctuate significantly  which could cause the market price of our securities to decline we may experience a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter 
any such shortfall in revenue could cause the market price of securities to fall substantially 
our revenue in general  and our license revenue in particular  are difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include the possibility that our customers may cancel  defer or limit purchases as a result of reduced information technology budgets or the current weak or uncertain general economic and industry conditions  the timing and magnitude of sales through our original equipment manufacturer customers  including hewlett packard  ibm  microsoft  oracle and sun microsystems  the possibility that a slowdown in sales by our original equipment manufacturer customers could result in reduced demand for our products and services  the unpredictability of the timing and magnitude of sales to the retail channel by our resellers and sales by our direct sales force  both of which tend to generate sales later in a quarter than original equipment manufacturer sales  the timing of revenue recognition for sales of software products and services  the introduction  timing and market acceptance of new products and services  changes in data storage and networking technology or introduction of new operating system upgrades by our original equipment manufacturer customers  which could require us to modify our products and services or to develop new products or services  the relative growth rates of the windows nt  unix and linux markets  the rate of adoption of storage area networks and network attached storage appliance technology and the timing and magnitude of sales of our storage area networking products and services that incorporate these  the rate of adoption of network attached storage appliance technology and the timing and magnitude of sales of our network attached storage appliance products and services  the extent to which our customers renew their service and maintenance contracts with us  changes in our pricing policies and distribution terms  the timing and amount of revenue attributable to our end user customers whose businesses are substantially dependent on the internet or the telecommunications markets  whose ability to purchase our products may be adversely affected by their inability to raise additional capital or to meet their business objectives  the possibility that our customers may defer purchases in anticipation of new products or product updates by us our by our competitors  the possibility that our customers may cancel  defer or limit purchases as a result of the threat of terrorism or military actions taken by the united states or its allies in reaction to that threat  the possibility that air travel delays or cancellations and air travel restrictions imposed by many companies could adversely affect our licensing efforts or our services revenue  as they result in our inability to visit customer sites and result in our customers inability to visit our offices  the overall demand for data availability products and services  which is likely to be lower in weak or uncertain general economic and industry conditions  and the possibility of a worsening of weak economic and industry conditions 
in the current uncertain economic environment  our revenue  and our license revenue in particular  are extremely difficult to forecast and will likely be less predictable from quarter to quarter 
you should not rely on the results of any prior periods as an indication of our future performance 
if we have a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  we probably will not be able to reduce our operating expenses quickly in response 
therefore  any significant shortfall in revenue could have an immediate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  it is possible that in some future periods our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock may decline 
our revenue may fluctuate because we depend on large orders from end user customers for a significant portion of our revenue we depend on large orders from end user customers  which entail lengthy sales cycles  for a significant portion of our revenue 
our revenue for a quarter could fluctuate significantly based on whether a large sale near the end of a quarter is completed or delayed 
sales to our end user customers generally range in value from a few thousand to several million dollars 
in recent quarters  increases in revenue were partially attributable to a greater number of these large end user transactions 
this trend may not continue 
the effort to close these large sales is typically complex and lengthy 
therefore  our revenue for a given period is likely to be affected by the timing of these large orders  which makes it difficult for us to predict that revenue 
the factors that could delay these large orders include time needed for end user customers to evaluate our software  customer budget restrictions or more lengthy approval processes  particularly in uncertain general economic and industry conditions  customer internal review and testing procedures  and engineering work needed to integrate our software with customers systems 
our business could be adversely affected if we fail to manage our growth effectively if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business and operating results could be adversely affected  which could cause the market price of our securities to fall 
we expect to continue to grow our operations domestically and internationally  and to increase our headcount 
the growth in our operations and headcount has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
if we fail to manage this growth and our future anticipated growth  we may experience higher operating expenses  and we may be unable to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to future operating results 
to manage this growth we must continue to improve our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures and proprietary information control procedures  continue to add and integrate new senior management personnel  improve our licensing models and procedures  hire and train qualified employees  retain qualified employees and manage employee performance  control expenses  integrate geographically dispersed operations  and invest in our internal networking  data center  applications  infrastructure and facilities 
we have committed a significant amount of money to obtaining additional facilities to accommodate our current and future anticipated growth 
to the extent that this anticipated growth does not occur or occurs more slowly than we anticipate  we may not be able to reduce expenses to the same degree 
if we incur operating expenses out of proportion to revenue in any given quarter  our operating results could be adversely impacted 
to grow our business  we need to attract and retain qualified employees our future growth and success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified employees  as needed  and to manage our employee base effectively 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
conversely  if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when necessary  our costs would be excessive and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we need to hire additional sales  technical  and senior management personnel to support the planned expansion of our business and to meet the anticipated increased customer demand for our products and services 
competition for people with the skills we require is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located  and the high cost of living in this area makes our recruiting and compensation costs higher 
as a result  we expect to continue to experience increases in compensation costs 
in addition  the exercise of stock options in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions may result in substantial increases in employer payroll tax liabilities 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining new personnel 
even if we are successful in hiring and retaining new personnel  the resulting growth is likely to be disruptive to our business and could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain our anticipated growth 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business our future anticipated growth and success depends on the continued service of our key sales  technical and senior management personnel 
many of our senior personnel have been with us for a number of years  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
the loss of senior personnel can result in significant disruption to our ongoing operations  and new senior personnel must spend a significant amount of time learning our business and our systems in addition to performing their regular duties 
even though we have entered into employment agreements with some key management personnel  these agreements cannot prevent their departure 
we do not have nor do we intend to obtain key person life insurance covering any of our personnel 
we face intense competition  which could cause us to lose market share we have a number of competitors in the markets for our various products 
if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of these markets  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
our principal competitors are internal development groups with original equipment manufacturers that provide data availability functions to support their systems  as well as hardware and software vendors that offer backup and file system and volume management  clustering and replication  and storage area networking products 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical sales  marketing and other resources than we do 
our future and existing competitors could introduce products with superior features  scalability and functionality at lower prices than our products  and could also bundle existing or new products with other more established products in order to compete with us 
our competitors could also gain market share by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our other competitors 
finally  because new distribution methods offered by the internet and electronic commerce have removed many of the barriers to entry historically faced by start up companies in the software industry  we expect to face additional competition from these companies in the future 
we distribute our products through multiple distribution channels  each of which is subject to risks we sell our products through original equipment manufacturers  through direct sales and through a retail distribution channel 
if we fail to manage our distribution channels successfully  they may conflict with one another or otherwise not function as we anticipate  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
retail distribution 
some of our software products are sold primarily in the retail channel  which poses different challenges than we face in selling most of our products  including the veritas brand does not have high recognition in the retail channel  retail distribution typically involves shorter product life cycles  the retail channel has higher risks of product returns  higher marketing expenses and less predictable market demand  and our retail distributors have no obligation to continue selling our products and may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
direct sales 
we also depend on our direct sales force to sell our products 
this involves a number of risks  including longer sales cycles for direct sales efforts  our need to hire  train  retain and motivate our direct sales force  and the length of time it takes our new sales representatives to become productive 
original equipment manufacturers 
a portion of our revenue comes from our original equipment manufacturer customers that incorporate our data availability software into systems they sell 
risks associated with our original equipment manufacturer customers include we have no control over the shipping dates or volumes of systems they ship  they have no obligation to recommend or offer our software products  they have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time  a significant period of time may elapse before we realize any associated revenue  due to development work that we must generally undertake under the agreement with our original equipment manufacture customers 
significant time may be needed for the sales and marketing organizations within these customers and distributors to become familiar with and gain confidence in our products  they could choose to develop their own data availability products and incorporate those products into their systems instead of our products  they could develop enhancements to and derivative products from our products  and they could change their own base products  which could make it difficult for us to adapt our products to theirs 
finally  our original equipment manufacturer customers compete with one another 
if one of our original equipment manufacturer customers views the products we have developed for another original equipment manufacturer as competing with its products  it might decide to stop doing business with us  which could adversely affect our business and our operating results 
some of our original equipment manufacturer agreements may not result in increased product sales we have important original equipment manufacturer agreements with hewlett packard  ibm  microsoft and sun microsystems 
unlike some of our other original equipment manufacturer agreements under which we sell off the shelf versions of our products  under these agreements we develop unique or limited functionality versions of our products to be included in these original equipment manufacturers systems software and products 
if we are unable to leverage these relationships to increase product sales  we will have expended significant resources without generating corresponding revenue  which could adversely affect our business and our operating results 
these relationships require our personnel to develop expertise with respect to the original equipment manufacturers products and markets and to cooperate closely with their personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified employees to work with our original equipment manufacturer customers or to develop and improve the products designed for these customers 
we face uncertainties porting products to new operating systems and developing new products many of our products operate primarily on the unix computer operating system 
we are currently redesigning  or porting  these products to operate on the windows nt operating system 
we are also developing new products for unix and for windows nt 
in addition  we entered into an agreement with ibm under which we will port our complete set of data availability products to aix monterey for ibm power pc and the intel ia processor system 
we may not be able to accomplish any of this work quickly or cost effectively  and it is not clear what the relative growth rates of these operating systems are 
these activities require substantial capital investment  the devotion of substantial employee resources and the cooperation of the owners of the operating systems to or for which the products are being ported or developed 
for example  our porting and development work for the windows nt market has required us to hire additional personnel with expertise on these platforms and to devote engineering resources to these projects 
for some operating systems  we must obtain from the owner of the operating system a source code license to portions of the operating system software to port some of our products to or develop products for the operating system 
operating system owners have no obligation to assist in these porting or development efforts 
if they do not grant us a license or if they do not renew our license  we may not be able to expand our product line into other areas 
sales of a small number of product lines make up a substantial portion of our revenue we derive and expect to derive a substantial majority of our revenue from a limited number of software products 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately million  or  of our user license fees from our core technologies  including data protection and file system and volume management products 
if our customers do not continue to purchase these products as a result of competition  technological change  budget constraints or other factors  our revenue would decrease and our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
we derive a significant amount of revenue from only a few customers although in  and no single customer accounted for greater than of our total net revenue  we typically derive significant revenue from a small number of customers  including our original equipment manufacturer customers 
if any of them were to reduce purchases of products or services from us  our business would be adversely affected unless we were able to increase sales to other customers substantially 
many of these customers have recently announced that their own businesses are slowing  which could adversely affect their demand for our products and services 
we do not have a contract with any of these customers that requires the customer to purchase any specified number of software licenses from us 
therefore  we cannot be sure that these customers will continue to purchase our products at current levels 
our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced products that achieve widespread market acceptance our future success depends on our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and introducing new products  product updates and services on a timely basis  by extending the operation of our products on new platforms and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
in order to grow our business  we are committing substantial resources to developing new software products and services  including software products and services for the storage area networking market and the network attached storage appliance market 
each of these markets is new and unproven  and industry standards for these markets are evolving and changing 
if these markets do not develop as anticipated  or demand for our products and services in these markets does not materialize or occurs more slowly than we expect  we will have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenue  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
our international sales and operations create special problems that could adversely affect our operating results an investment in our securities may be riskier than an investment in other businesses because we expect to derive an increasing percentage of our revenue from customers located outside of the us we have significant operations outside of the us  including engineering  sales  customer support and production operations  and we plan to expand our international operations 
as of december   we had approximately  employees in europe  employees in the asia pacific region  and employees in japan 
our foreign operations are subject to risks  including potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  imposition of foreign laws and other governmental controls  including trade restrictions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates and inflation  which could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products or which could make our products more expensive in those countries  difficulties in hedging foreign currency transaction exposures  longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations  including difficulties related to administering our stock option plan in foreign countries and difficulties related to the new organizational structure in europe that we implemented in  difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations  seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and other countries  costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple languages  and political unrest or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities 
in addition  our foreign sales are denominated in local currency  creating risk of foreign currency translation gains and losses that could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non us customers 
these benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in both the us and in the countries in which our international customers are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could affect our anticipated ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 
our growth strategy is risky because it includes business acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we have in the past and expect in the future to acquire other businesses  business units and technologies 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention from our core business  integration of acquired business operations and employees with our existing business  including coordination of geographically dispersed operations  incorporation of acquired business technology into our existing product lines  including consolidating technology with duplicative functionality or designed on different technological architecture  loss or termination of employees  including costly litigation resulting from the termination of those employees  dilution of our then current stockholders percentage ownership  assumption of liabilities of the acquired business  including costly litigation related to alleged liabilities of the acquired business  presentation of a unified corporate image to our customers and our employees  and risk of impairment charges related to potential write down of acquired assets in future acquisitions 
in the past  our integration of the operations of acquired businesses took longer and was more difficult than we anticipated 
as a result of the seagate technology leveraged buyout and merger transaction  our subsidiary may be liable to third parties for liabilities resulting from seagate s operations before the transaction in november  in the leveraged buyout and merger transaction involving veritas and seagate technology  seagate technology sold all of its operating assets to suez acquisition cayman company  and seagate technology became our subsidiary 
as part of the transaction  suez acquisition company assumed and agreed to indemnify our subsidiary and us for substantially all liabilities arising in connection with seagate s operations prior to the transaction 
however  governmental organizations or other third parties may seek recourse against our subsidiary or us for these liabilities 
prior to the transaction  seagate was a large  multinational enterprise that owned or leased facilities and offices in numerous states and foreign countries and employed over  people worldwide 
as a result  our subsidiary could receive claims related to a wide range of possible liabilities 
some areas of potential liability include environmental cleanup costs and liabilities for claims made under federal  state or foreign environmental laws  tax liabilities  obligations under federal  state and foreign pension and retirement benefit laws  existing or future litigation relating to the leveraged buyout or the merger transaction  existing and future litigation arising from the restructuring that seagate commenced last year  including litigation initiated by terminated employees  and existing and future patent litigation 
any such claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and divert management attention from our core business 
moreover  if suez acquisition company is unable or unwilling to indemnify our subsidiary or us under the indemnification agreement for any of these liabilities  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the seagate merger consideration may be subject to recovery under fraudulent conveyance laws the leveraged buyout and merger transaction involving veritas and seagate technology may be subject to review under state or federal fraudulent transfer laws in the event that a bankruptcy case or lawsuit is commenced by or on behalf of unpaid creditors of suez acquisition company or any of its affiliates 
under bankruptcy laws  a court could attempt to proceed against the consideration paid to seagate s stockholders in the merger  or direct that amounts deposited with the trustee administering the distributions of seagate s tax refunds and credits be held for the benefit of creditors 
a court might take one or more of these actions if it determined that when the leveraged buyout was completed  seagate s operating assets were sold for less then fair value and at that time seagate  suez acquisition company and their affiliates were or became insolvent  were engaged in a business or transaction for which their unencumbered assets constituted unreasonably small capital  or intended to incur or reasonably should have believed that they would incur debts beyond their ability to repay as those debts matured 
a court could also proceed against the consideration paid to seagate s stockholders in the merger  or against seagate s tax refunds and credits otherwise payable to seagate s former stockholders following the merger  if the court found that seagate effected the leveraged buyout with an actual intent to hinder  delay or defraud its creditors 
our effective tax rate may increase our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
our effective tax rate is directly affected by the relative proportions of domestic and international revenue and income before taxes 
we are also subject to changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate 
we do not have a history of audit activity from various taxing authorities and while we believe we are in compliance with all federal  state and international tax laws  there are various interpretations of their application that could result in additional tax assessments 
in addition  in november  we acquired seagate technology  which has significant tax audit and tax litigation activity 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses against asserted deficiencies and that the likely outcome of a re determination of these asserted deficiencies by the tax settlement authorities will not result in an additional provision for income taxes 
we have an indemnification agreement with suez acquisition company for these deficiencies 
if suez acquisition company is unable to or is unwilling to indemnify our subsidiary or us under the indemnification agreement for any of these deficiencies  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our strategy of investing in development stage companies involves a number of risks and uncertainties we plan to pursue a strategy of investing in development stage companies 
each of these investments involves risks and uncertainties  including diversion of management s attention from our core business  failure to leverage our relationship with these companies to access new technologies and new markets  inability to value investments appropriately or to predict changes to the future value of investments  inability to manage investments effectively  and loss of cash invested 
we are incurring significant accounting charges in connection with our acquisitions that created net losses in the past and could create net losses in the future the significant costs of integration associated with our acquisitions of nsmg  telebackup and nuview in increase the risk that we will not realize the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
because we accounted for these three acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately  million in this amount is being amortized over four years  and resulted in charges to operations of approximately million per quarter 
on january  upon adoption of newly issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the quarterly charges related to the amortization of developed technology  goodwill and other intangibles will decrease 
refer to the new accounting pronouncements section for a discussion on the impacts of the adoption of sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on our financial statements 
we have a significant amount of debt that we may be unable to service or repay in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due  of which million was outstanding as of december  in august  we issued million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of convertible subordinated notes due  of which million was outstanding as of december  as of december   the annual interest payments on our outstanding notes were million and the annual interest payments on our outstanding notes were million  all of which we plan to fund from cash flows from operations 
we will need to generate substantial amounts of cash from our operations to fund interest payments and to repay the principal amount of debt when it matures  while at the same time funding capital expenditures and our other working capital needs 
if we do not have sufficient cash to pay our debts as they come due  we could be in default of those debts 
for example  if we do not make timely payments  the notes could be declared immediately due and payable 
our substantial leverage could also increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions because it makes it more difficult for us to raise capital if needed 
in addition  any changes in accounting rules regarding our operating leases and built to suit facilities may affect our debt levels and operating expenses in the future 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary information we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  contractual provisions and other measures to protect our proprietary information 
all of these measures afford only limited protection 
these measures may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  and others may develop technologies or processes that are similar or superior to our technology 
we may not have the proprietary information controls and procedures in place that we need to protect our proprietary information adequately 
in addition  because we license the source code for some of our products to third parties  there is a higher likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of our intellectual property 
we also license some of our products under shrink wrap license agreements that are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary 
third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we may from time to time receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others 
as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap  we believe that we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims  including patent and copyright infringement claims 
we have received several trademark claims in the past and may receive more claims in the future based on the name veritas  which is a word commonly used in trade names throughout europe and the western hemisphere 
in addition  former employers of our former  current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers 
any such claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention from our core business  require us to stop selling  to delay shipping or to redesign our product  and require us to pay monetary amounts as damages  for royalty or licensing arrangements  or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers 
in addition  we license and use software from third parties in our business 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms 
also  these third parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  including patent and copyright infringement claims  which may affect our ability to continue licensing this software 
our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we might experience significant defects in our products software products frequently contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
we might experience significant errors or failures in our products  or they might not work with other hardware or software as expected  which could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products  or which could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
our end user customers use our products for applications that are critical to their businesses  and they have a greater sensitivity to product defects than the market for software products generally 
if we were to experience significant delays in the release of new products or new versions of products  or if customers were dissatisfied with product functionality or performance  we could lose revenue or be subject to liability for service or warranty costs  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
natural disasters or power outages could disrupt our business we must protect our business and our network infrastructure against damage from earthquake  flood  hurricane and similar events  as well as from power outages 
many of our operations are subject to these risks  particularly our operations located in california 
we have already experienced temporary power losses in our california facilities due to power shortages that have disrupted our operations  and we may in the future experience additional power losses that could disrupt our operations 
while the impact to our business and operating results has not been material  we cannot assure you that power losses will not adversely affect our business in the future  or that the cost of acquiring sufficient power to run our business will not increase significantly 
a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem could adversely effect our business  including both our primary data center and other internal operations and our ability to communicate with our customers or sell our products over the internet 
some provisions in our charter documents may prevent or deter certain corporate actions some of the provisions in our charter documents may deter or prevent certain corporate actions  such as a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  which could affect the market value of our securities 
these provisions include our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with any rights it may determine  our board of directors is classified into three groups  with each group of directors to hold office for three years  our stockholders are not entitled to cumulate votes for directors and may not take any action by written consent without a meeting  and special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of directors  by the chairman of the board or by our chief executive officer  and may not be called by our stockholders 
we also have in place a stockholder rights plan that is designed to discourage coercive takeover offers 
our stock price may be volatile in the future  and you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly  and you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including announcements of our quarterly operating results or those of our competitors or our original equipment manufacturer customers  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  announcements of planned acquisitions by us or by our competitors  the gain or loss of a significant customer  announcements of new products by us  our competitors or our original equipment manufacturer customers  and slowdowns in the economy generally 
the stock market in general  and the market prices of stocks of other technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price volatility  which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and we have established a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
we do not use forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other income expense 
the unrealized gain loss on the outstanding forward contracts at december  was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
our outstanding forward contracts as of december  are presented in the table below 
all forward contract amounts are representative of the expected payments to be made under these instruments 
all forward contracts mature in days or less as of december  dollars in thousands fair market value local currency at december  contract amount contract amount us contracts to buy us australian dollar  aud usd british pound  gbp  usd euro  eur  usd contracts to sell us brazilian reals brl usd japanese yen  jpy  usd contracts to buy euro australian dollar  aud  eur british pound  gbp  eur japanese yen  jpy  eur swiss franc  chf  eur in september  we entered into a three year cross currency interest rate swap transaction swap for the purpose of hedging fixed interest rate  foreign currency denominated cash flows under an inter company loan receivable 
under the terms of this derivative financial instrument  euro denominated fixed principal and interest payments to be received under the inter company loan will be swapped for us dollar fixed principal and interest payments 
as a december   monthly payments of million remained to be swapped at a forward exchange rate of us dollar per euro 
the fair market value of the swap at december  was million 
as a result of entering into the swap  we have mitigated our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the gains or losses on the foreign currency loan receivable will be offset by the gains or losses on the swap 
because we are receiving fixed interest payments under the swap  we are still subject to fluctuations in value due to changes in us dollar interest rates 
as of december  the impact of these fluctuations was not significant 
this hedge was deemed to be perfectly effective as of december  interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government agency securities taxable and non taxable  asset backed securities and market auction preferreds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
long term debt of million consists of our notes of million and our notes of million 
the interest rate of on the notes together with the accrual of original issue discount represent a yield to maturity of 
the nominal interest rate on these notes is fixed and the notes provide for semi annual interest payments of approximately million each may and november for the notes and approximately million each february and august for the notes 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  subject to adjustment in certain events 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents  investments and long term debt  according to maturity date  that may be subject to interest rate risk and the average interest rates as of december  by year of maturity dollars in thousands amortized amortized cost fair value cost and thereafter cash equivalents and short term investments fixed rate average fixed rate variable rate average variable rate total cash equivalents and short term investments investments average rate long term investments fixed rate average fixed rate long term debt fixed rate average fixed rate equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of our portfolio of equity securities investments 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these equity securities 
these investments are in companies in the high technology industry 
as of december   we held one marketable equity security  representing a total market value of million 
assuming a adverse change  our marketable equity securities investments would decrease in value by approximately million 
if our marketable equity security investments as of december  had been valued using prices as of march   the value of these securities would have decreased by approximately million  or 
this estimate is not necessarily indicative of future performance and actual results may differ materially 
we also made investments in development stage companies that we believe provide strategic opportunities for us 
we intend that these investments will provide access to new technologies and emerging markets  and create opportunities for additional sales of our products and services 
during the third quarter of  we recognized impairment losses of million on our strategic investments when we determined that there had been a decline in the fair value of the investment that was other than temporary 
the losses represented write downs of the carrying amount of our investments and were determined by using  among other factors  an investee s significant decline in stock value  its inability to obtain additional private financing  and the uncertainty of its financial conditions 
we cannot assure you that our investments will have the above mentioned results  or even that we will not lose all or any part of these investments
