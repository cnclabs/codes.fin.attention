item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below is a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december  this discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on management s plans that are subject to uncertainty 
the company discusses in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item  under the section factors influencing future results and accuracy of forward looking statements of this report 
this discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in preparing our financial statements  we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
however  the most difficult  subjective and complex estimates  and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty  are related to our accounting for landfills and environmental liabilities 
landfill airspace amortization and final closure post closure costs we expense amounts for landfill airspace usage and landfill final closure and post closure costs for each ton of waste accepted for disposal at our landfills 
in determining the amount to expense for each ton of waste accepted  we estimate the total cost to develop each landfill site to its final capacity and the total final closure and post closure costs for each landfill site 
our engineers also estimate the tonnage capacity of the landfill 
the expense for each ton is then calculated based on the total costs remaining and the total remaining tonnage capacity 
estimates for projected landfill site costs and for final closure and post closure costs are developed using input from the company s engineers and accountants and are reviewed by management  typically at least once per year 
the estimates for landfill final closure and post closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in  where appropriate  inflation and discount rates 
as of december  and  the net book value recorded for capitalized landfill site costs was billion and billion  respectively 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  we expect to incur billion related to future construction activities during the remaining operating lives of the disposal sites 
the future costs will be capitalized as incurred and expensed over the useful lives of the disposal sites as airspace is consumed 
the average landfill airspace amortization cost per ton for the landfills operating at december  was per ton as compared to for the landfills at december  as of december  and  we had recorded landfill final closure and post closure liabilities of million and million  respectively 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  we estimate that the aggregate cost of landfill final closure and post closure as of december  is approximately billion 
additional closure and post closure costs in excess of those recorded at december  will be accrued and charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the total present value of estimated final closure and post closure costs will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time each site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
the average landfill final closure and post closure expense  on a per ton basis  for the landfills operating at december  was per ton as compared to for the landfills at december  this decrease in average landfill final closure and post closure rates from to was caused primarily by three facilities with significantly higher than normal per ton amortization rates 
as these three facilities neared closure in  based on specific facts and circumstances  we were required to increase their final closure and post closure rates in order to be adequately accrued for final closure and post closure at the time the landfills closed 
in determining the amounts to expense for airspace amortization and final closure and post closure costs  our engineers estimate the unused permitted airspace at each landfill 
we will also consider expansion airspace in our estimate of available airspace when we believe the success of obtaining such an airspace expansion is probable 
the criteria we use for evaluating the probability of obtaining an expansion permit to landfill airspace at existing sites are as follows personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local and state approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill  at the time the expansion is added to the permitted site life  it is probable that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located  either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan  there are no significant known technical  legal  community  business  or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion  financial analysis has been completed  and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact  and airspace and related costs  including additional final closure and post closure costs  have been estimated based on conceptual design 
additionally  to include airspace associated with an expansion effort  the expansion permit application must generally be expected to be submitted within one year  and the expansion permit must be expected to be received within two to five years 
exceptions to these criteria must be approved through a landfill specific approval process that includes the approval from the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
of the landfills with probable expansions included in the landfill airspace calculations at december   probable landfill expansions required the chief financial officer to approve an exception to the criteria 
approximately two thirds of these exceptions were due to legal or community issues that could impede the expansion process  while the remaining were primarily due to permit application processes beyond the one year limit  which in most cases were due to state specific permitting procedures 
we have generally been successful in receiving approvals for expansions pursued  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining landfill expansions in the future 
in some cases we may be unsuccessful in obtaining an expansion permit or we may determine that an expansion permit that we previously thought was probable becomes unlikely 
the estimates and assumptions used in developing this information are reviewed by our engineers and accountants at least annually  and we believe them to be reasonable 
however  to the extent that such estimates  or the assumptions used to make those estimates  prove to be incorrect  or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes to remote  the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion will be charged against earnings  net of any capitalized expenditures and advances that will be recoverable  through sale or otherwise 
additionally  the landfill s future operations will typically reflect lower profitability due to higher amortization rates  final closure and post closure rates  and expenses related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace 
the landfill may also become subject to impairment  which could be material to the results of operations of any individual reporting period 
environmental remediation liabilities under current laws and regulations  we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations  or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a particular site 
we estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site specific facts and circumstances 
cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter  ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan  and iii the extent of other parties share of responsibility 
while the precise amount of these future remediation costs cannot be determined with absolute certainty  we have estimated that the aggregate cost as of december  is approximately million 
as of december  and  we had recorded liabilities of million and million  respectively  for the present value of remediation costs of our sites 
our engineers and accountants also specifically review the estimates and assumptions related to environmental remediation liabilities at least annually 
in many circumstances the actual costs related to these liabilities which we have estimated or assumed may not be known for decades into the future 
however  we believe that based on our extensive experience in the environmental services business and the large number of sites we have dealt with  we have the ability to reasonably estimate our aggregate liability 
as additional information becomes available  estimates are adjusted as necessary 
it is possible that technological  regulatory or enforcement developments  the results of environmental studies  the nonexistence or inability of other potentially responsible third parties to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities  or other factors could prove our estimates to be inaccurate  necessitating the recording of additional liabilities  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements 
accounting charges and adjustments in  we initiated a comprehensive internal review of our accounting records  systems  processes and controls at the direction of our board of directors 
as discussed below  and in note to the consolidated financial statements  we experienced significant difficulty in the integration and conversion of information and accounting systems after the wm holdings merger  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
as a result of these systems and process issues  and other issues raised during the accounting review  certain charges and adjustments were recorded  as discussed below 
the review was completed such that we were able to record related adjustments in our financial statements for the quarter ended september  the amounts we recorded as a result of the review had a material effect on our financial statements for the year ended december  the following is a summary of charges attributable to this review  which were recorded for the quarter ended september  in millions operations held for sale adjustments increase to allowance for doubtful accounts and other accounts receivable adjustments asset impairments excluding held for sale adjustments insurance reserves and other insurance adjustments legal  severance and consulting accruals merger and acquisition related costs other charges and adjustments  including account reconciliations loss contract reserve adjustments increase in environmental liabilities other impact of charges before income tax benefit  income tax benefit after tax charges  the charges described above include both recurring and nonrecurring items  which have been aggregated for this presentation  and are reflected in our financial statements for the year ended december  as follows in millions allowance for doubtful accounts insurance merger and other reserves legal  and other held for accounts and other severance and acquisition charges sale receivable other asset insurance consulting related and adjustments adjustments impairments adjustments accruals costs adjustments operating revenues costs and expenses operating exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization merger and acquisition related costs asset impairments and unusual items loss from operations other income expense interest expense interest income minority interest other income expense loss before income taxes and extraordinary items benefit from income taxes net loss total includes recurring and non recurring items operating revenues costs and expenses operating exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization merger and acquisition related costs asset impairments and unusual items loss from operations  other income expense interest expense interest income minority interest other income expense loss before income taxes and extraordinary items  benefit from income taxes net loss  subsequent to the completion of the accounting review  and in conjunction with the process of preparing our monthly financial statements during the fourth quarter of and our financial statements at december   additional adjustments attributable to the reconciliation of intercompany accounts  cash  accounts receivable  fixed assets  accounts payable and certain other accounts were recorded

results of operations for the three years ended december  operating revenues our operating revenues in were billion  compared to billion in and billion in our revenues decreased in and primarily because we sold our international operations outside of north america  most of our non solid waste businesses  and certain non integrated nasw operations pursuant to our strategic plan 
as shown below  nasw is our principal reportable segment 
our other segment was reported in previous years as wm international and non solid waste 
beginning in  and continuing through and into  we sold all operations that had previously been reported in wm international and most of the operations that had been reported in non solid waste 
operating revenues by reportable segment in millions operating revenues 
chart 
nasw    other   total    nasw operating revenue mix in millions 
chart 
collection    disposal    transfer    recycling and other intercompany    total    our nasw operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection  disposal  and transfer station services 
a portion of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services is billed in advance  a liability for future service is recorded upon receipt of payment and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided 
revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties based on the volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi monthly 
fees charged at transfer stations are based on the volume of waste deposited  taking into account our cost of loading  transporting  and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site 
intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
nasw revenues decreased by million in from due primarily to the sales of our non integrated nasw operations during and  to a lesser extent  in additionally  we experienced negative internal growth in our nasw operations of or million in internal growth was negatively impacted by declines in the prices of recyclable commodities of or million as well as lower volumes of or million compared to the negative volume is largely attributable to the overall slowing of the north american economy  our terminating unprofitable accounts  and the impact of our policy change for third party brokers  which required more stringent contract requirements  thereby resulting in the loss of some brokered waste 
also contributing to the decline in nasw operating revenues were fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate of the canadian dollar  which reduced revenues by million 
in addition  in the company recognized negative fair market value adjustments of million for pulp and paper commodity derivatives with enron as the counterparty 
these derivatives were intended to mitigate the price risk associated with pulp and paper commodities that we process and sell to third parties 
offsetting these revenue declines were the acquisition of certain nasw operations in and the year over year effect of acquisitions of nasw operations in our nasw operating revenues increased by million in as compared to mostly because we had internal growth in comparable operations 
we had a or million increase in revenues from pricing increases and a or million increase in revenues from volume increases 
during the first half of  the pricing in the recyclable materials markets favorably impacted overall pricing increases  but those improvements were offset by the significant recyclable materials market downturn in the second half of additionally  we implemented a fuel surcharge in march to mitigate the significant increase in the cost of fuel 
if we excluded the effects of the price increases for recyclable materials and the fuel surcharge  there was a price increase of in compared to acquisitions of nasw businesses in and the full year effect of acquisitions that were completed in increased nasw operating revenue by in as compared to  but that increase was offset by the sales of the non integrated nasw operations 
foreign currency fluctuations with the canadian dollar also negatively impacted operating revenues during operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below our operating costs and expenses include direct and indirect labor and related taxes and benefits  fuel  maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations  and accruals for future landfill final closure and post closure costs and environmental remediation 
certain direct landfill development expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of a site as capacity is consumed  and include acquisition  engineering  upgrading  construction  capitalized interest  and permitting costs 
all indirect expenses  such as administrative salaries and general corporate overhead  are expensed in the period incurred 
we sometimes receive reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to environmentally related remedial  defense and tort claim costs at a number of our sites 
such recoveries are included in operating costs and expenses as an offset to environmental expenses 
our operating costs and expenses decreased in as compared to  and decreased in as compared to as a percentage of operating revenues  operating costs and expenses decreased from in  to in and decreased again to in the year to year decline in operating costs and expenses between and was primarily caused by the sales of our wm international  non solid waste and non integrated nasw operations 
these sales occurred throughout and into adding to the decrease was the effect of the volume declines in as compared to as described in the discussion of nasw operating revenues 
as a percentage of revenues  operating costs and expenses were exceptionally high in because of the difficulties we had integrating operations after the wm holdings merger 
in  operating costs and expenses decreased as we started improving our procurement practices and developing more standardized operating procedures  although the decrease as a percentage of revenue was not as great due to the decrease in revenues in the same period 
our improvements continued and caused further decreases in operating costs and expenses into additionally  in we implemented market strategy and procurement initiatives  as well as other cost saving initiatives  such as preventative maintenance programs that created an overall reduction in repair and maintenance costs 
finally  in we aggressively pursued our claims against insurers for reimbursement of environmental expenses  recovering approximately million in as compared to million in and million in these recoveries of environmental expenses are recorded as an offset to operating costs and expenses 
if we excluded the insurance recoveries  operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues were unaffected in and  and would have been in as part of our ongoing operations  we review our requirements for remediation and other environmental liabilities based on an analysis of  among other things  the regulatory context surrounding landfills  site specific environmental issues and remaining airspace capacity in light of changes to operational efficiencies 
accordingly  revisions to remediation liability requirements may result in upward or downward adjustments to income from operations in any given period 
adjustments for final closure and post closure estimates are accounted for prospectively over the remaining capacity of the operating landfill 
there was no impact on operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues for revisions to remedial environmental and similar liabilities in or  and there was a decrease of in selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses include management salaries  clerical and administrative costs  professional services  facility rentals  provision for doubtful accounts and related insurance costs  as well as costs related to our marketing and sales force 
our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in compared to and decreased million  or  in compared to as a percentage of operating revenues  our selling  general and administrative expenses were for  for and for the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to is due mostly to the divestitures that we completed throughout in addition  as discussed below  we had significant costs in related to accounting and process improvement initiatives 
these costs were not as significant in  as we were able to stabilize our accounting systems and substantially complete our process improvement initiatives in the second half of offsetting these decreases were costs related to corporate staffing increases  which began primarily in and continued in in  we incurred significant costs for our process improvement initiatives and the accounting assistance that began as part of our accounting review 
these costs were mainly in the first half of because  by the second half of  we had stabilized our accounting systems and completed our process improvement initiatives  which significantly reduced our ongoing need for these services 
in  we incurred approximately million for professional accounting and process improvement consulting services and consulting services related to the implementation of new enterprise information systems 
approximately million related to our divestitures  improvements to our billing systems and verification of our customer base  and legal fees related to certain stockholder litigation and other sec matters was also recorded in however  in we were successful in collecting certain accounts that were reserved for in  favorably impacting our provision for bad debt in  which decreased from million in to million in we also experienced permanent staffing increases at our corporate office throughout  particularly in the area of information systems and corporate accounting and finance 
selling  general and administrative expenses for included million in adjustments resulting from the accounting review  some of which are recurring in nature and should be expected in future periods 
these significant adjustments include an increase of million relative to the allowance for doubtful accounts and million in costs for insurance adjustments  accounting  legal and other professional services 
these costs were primarily related to litigation and investigations we conducted in in connection with the announcements of our lower expectations for earnings per share in july and august additionally  our administrative costs in  particularly in the third and fourth quarters  were exceptionally high due to the increased costs to perform administrative functions attributable to our integration problems after the wm holdings merger 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization includes i amortization of goodwill on a straight line basis over a period of years or less  commencing on the dates of the respective acquisitions  ii amortization of other intangible assets on a straight line basis from to years  iii depreciation of property and equipment on a straight line basis from to years  and iv amortization of landfill costs on a units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in as compared to and decreased in as compared to as a percentage of operating revenues  depreciation and amortization expense was in  in and in the decrease in depreciation and amortization in is attributable to the amortization expense of goodwill on operations that were divested throughout  more cost effective use of our landfill assets in and a temporary increase in fully depreciated trucks and other equipment associated with delays in receiving new equipment in the first half of as a percentage of operating revenues  depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to primarily because of the full year suspension of depreciation in on fixed assets which were held for sale 
the depreciation suspension for for these held for sale operations prior to those operations being sold was million  or of operating revenues 
the depreciation suspended in for operations held for sale  which all occurred in the fourth quarter of  was million  or of operating revenue 
however  the decreases in depreciation and amortization expense were partially offset by increased landfill airspace amortization in due to increases in disposal volumes at our landfills 
we also experienced higher airspace amortization expense in as compared to the prior years  due to higher airspace amortization rates as a result of our more stringent criteria for evaluating the probability of obtaining airspace expansions  which was effective starting in the third quarter of included in depreciation and amortization expense for are adjustments resulting from the accounting review 
these adjustments primarily included adjustments to increases to landfill amortization expenses as a result of the comprehensive review of the nasw landfill expansion projects 
merger and acquisition related costs  asset impairments and unusual items in  and  we had significant charges related to merger and acquisition related costs  asset impairments and unusual items 
in  these were charges that we identified during our accounting review  or that resulted from our losses from businesses sold and held for sale adjustments for businesses to be sold 
in  these costs were primarily due to our sale of our international operations outside of north america and the termination of wm holdings defined benefit pension plan  which are more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in  expenses included in this category were primarily attributable to the agreement that was reached to settle the stockholder class action lawsuit filed against us in july alleging violations of the federal securities laws which  net of the recovery from the stockholders derivative suit against the company s auditor  resulted in a charge of million 
the settlement of the class action  which is subject to court approval  provides for our payment to the class of million 
we believe the payment  which is expected to be made in the second half of  will result in a net cash outflow of approximately to million after considering insurance  tax deductions and related settlement costs 
in addition  we recorded a held for sale adjustment of approximately million related to our international operations outside of north america along with a held for sale adjustment for an investment in an operation in mexico of approximately million 
offsetting this expense was a net gain of million comprised of the reversal of the held for sale impairment of million and a held for use impairment of million from our decision during the third quarter of not to sell all but one of our ipps  and the reclassification in the third quarter of of all but one of our ipps from held for sale to held for use 
also included in asset impairments and unusual items for are reversals of certain loss contract reserves of million that we determined to be in excess of current requirements  and other unusual items 
interest expense our interest expense decreased in and as compared to because we paid down debt throughout and with proceeds from our divestitures and our cash flows from operations 
in addition  contributing to the decrease was a million offset to interest expense for interest rate swaps we used to manage our interest rate exposure 
partially offsetting the overall decrease in interest expense was a decrease in capitalized interest recorded from period to period due to an overall decrease in interest rates 
we capitalized interest of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million  million and million for  and  respectively  resulting in an effective income tax rate of  and for each of the three years  respectively 
the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for these years is primarily due to state and local income taxes  non deductible costs related to acquired intangibles  non deductible costs associated with the impairment and divestiture of certain businesses and other charges and adjustments related to the accounting review as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and  the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested 
additionally  in scheduled canadian federal and provincial tax rate reductions resulted in a benefit of million  which was offset in part by an expense of million related to our plan to repatriate certain capital and earnings previously deemed permanently invested in canada 
the non recurring million benefit arising from the change in canadian tax rates resulted in a reduction in the company s overall effective income tax rate in liquidity and capital resources the company operates in a capital intensive business and continuing access to various financing sources is vital to our operations 
in the past  we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive and we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future 
there are several key factors considered by credit rating agencies and financial markets to be important in determining our future access to financing 
these factors include the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base  our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows  our asset base  and our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation 
in addition to our working capital needs for ongoing operations  we have capital requirements for i capital expenditures for construction and expansion of landfill sites  as well as new trucks and equipment for collection operations  ii refurbishments and improvements at waste to energy facilities and iii business acquisitions 
for  we currently expect to spend approximately billion for capital expenditures and approximately million for the purchases of businesses 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years total long term debt including current maturities    expected aggregate environmental liabilities based on current cost   non cancellable rental obligations total contractual cash obligations a    a these contractual obligations do not include our accounts payable and accrued liabilities other than environmental liabilities which we expect to be paid in  nor do they include other long term liabilities which we generally expect to be settled over the next several years 
our strategy is to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations first from internally generated funds 
historically  we have also  when appropriate  obtained financing from issuing debt and common stock 
the following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended december   and in millions cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year cash provided by operating activities    cash provided by used in investing activities    cash provided by used in financing activities  in  cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by our integration efforts in connection with the wm holdings merger and the merger with eastern environmental services  inc eastern the eastern merger  which both occurred in  and the subsequent operational and administrative difficulties we had 
in we spent approximately billion on acquisitions of businesses and approximately billion on capital expenditures 
we funded these investing activities with cash flows from operations  net debt borrowings of approximately million  other net financing activities of million and proceeds from sales of assets of approximately million 
in  we spent million to acquire businesses  billion in capital expenditures and billion on net debt reductions 
we financed these cash expenditures primarily with billion of cash flows from operations and billion of proceeds from our divestitures 
a tax refund of approximately million and our improvements in accounts receivable average days sale outstanding favorably impacted cash flows from operations in in  we generated cash flows from operations of approximately billion 
favorably impacting cash flows from operations was cash received of million for the settlement of environmental related claims that we had against certain insurance carriers and million that we received from counterparties when we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements prior to the scheduled maturities 
included in our investing activities was billion of capital expenditures and million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses 
these expenditures were offset by proceeds from sales of assets and other investing activities of million 
in addition  we used million for financing activities  which is comprised of million of net debt reductions and million of other financing activities  offset by proceeds of million from exercises of common stock options and warrants  and other financing activities 
the following summary of free cash flows has been prepared to highlight and facilitate understanding of the primary cash flow elements 
it is not intended to replace the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and  which were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
adjusted free cash flow in the table below  which is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  is defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures  adjusted for certain cash flow activity that we consider as unusual for the respective periods 
the analysis of free cash flows for the years ended december  and is as follows in millions years ended december  ebitda a   interest paid taxes paid change in assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures  and other net cash provided by operating activities   capital expenditures   free cash flow  adjustments tax refund interest rate swap terminations pension plan termination payments accounting and consulting services litigation settlements reimbursement for late allocation of employee stock purchase plan shares other adjusted free cash flow   a ebitda is defined herein as income from operations excluding depreciation and amortization and asset impairments and unusual items 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  but we have provided it here because we understand that such information is used by certain investors when analyzing our financial position and performance 
on june   we replaced our prior bank credit facilities with a million syndicated line of credit the line of credit and a  million syndicated revolving credit facility the revolver 
the line of credit requires annual renewal by the lender  and if it is not renewed  we have the option of converting the balance outstanding  if any  as of june  into a one year term loan 
the revolver matures in june as of december   we had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of billion  of which approximately billion are issued under our revolver  that generally have terms allowing automatic renewal after a year 
at december  and march   we had unused and available credit capacity under the bank credit facilities of approximately million and billion  respectively 
in february  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due august  interest is payable semi annually on february and august the net proceeds from the offering of the notes were approximately million  after deducting discounts to the underwriters and expenses 
we used the net proceeds from this offering  together with cash from operations  to repay million of senior notes that matured during the second quarter of in march  we worked with local governmental authorities to refinance million of fixed rate  tax exempt bonds maturing through with million of variable rate  tax exempt bonds maturing through and million of fixed rate bonds maturing through the new borrowings include million of related financing costs 
we recorded a net extraordinary loss of million in the first quarter of for the remaining unamortized premium and issuance costs related to the retired debt 
in november  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due november  interest on the notes is payable semi annually on may and november the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting discounts to the underwriters and expenses  were approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million of our convertible subordinated notes due february  at the maturity date  we redeemed the remaining million outstanding primarily using cash obtained from the november senior note issuance 
on july   we issued million of mandatorily tendered senior notes  due july  the notes were subject to certain mandatory tender features as described in the indenture  which allowed us to repurchase all of the outstanding notes on july  we used available cash on hand along with funds from the line of credit to repurchase the notes in july during the third quarter of  we recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately million  net of taxes  for the retirement of this debt 
in addition  we have million of senior notes due july   million of senior notes due october  and million of senior notes due december  we have classified these borrowings as long term at december  based upon our ability to use our line of credit and or revolver  which are both considered long term facilities  to refinance these borrowings 
we intend to pursue other sources of long term financing to refinance these borrowings  however  in the event other sources of long term financing are not available  we have the intent and ability to use our line of credit and or revolver 
at december   we had interest rate swap agreements with third parties with a notional amount of billion 
these agreements were established to manage the interest rate risk of our senior note obligations and at december   these interest rate swap agreements had a net negative fair value of million 
under the hedge method of accounting for these types of derivatives  the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements is recorded as either a risk management asset or liability with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the long term debt  which is the hedged instrument 
our reported long term debt does not include such an adjustment at december   since we adopted the statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as of january  in early october  we elected to terminate certain of our interest rate swap agreements and we received cash of million which is comprised of million for the fair value of the swaps that were terminated and million for interest expense offsets previously accrued for settlements from the counterparties 
under the hedge method of accounting for these types of derivatives  the unamortized adjustment to long term debt for these terminated swaps of million at december  remains in long term debt and will be amortized until the maturity of the related senior note obligation  the interest rate risk of which the hedge was established to manage 
approximately million of this adjustment to long term debt will be amortized as an offset to interest expense in in november  we announced that we had entered into an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits filed against us in july alleging violations of the federal securities laws 
under the settlement agreement  which is subject to court approval  we agreed to pay million to the class 
we expect our net cash outflow  after considering insurance  tax deductions and related settlement costs  to be approximately to million 
the settlement will most likely be paid in the second half of  with a minimal level of additional borrowing necessary to fund the settlement 
in february  we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock buy back program 
under the program  we will buy back up to billion of our common stock each year 
the purchases will be made in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions using cash flow from operations 
special purpose entities on june   two limited liability companies llcs were established to purchase interests in existing leveraged lease financings at three of our waste to energy facilities 
john hancock life insurance company hancock has ownership in one of the llcs 
the second llc is collectively owned by hancock and the cit group cit 
we have a interest in both llcs 
hancock and cit made an initial investment of approximately million in the llcs 
under the llc agreements the llcs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence of any of the following events i a written decision of all the members of the llcs to dissolve the llcs  ii december   iii the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under the delaware limited liability company act  or iv the llcs cease to own any interest in these waste to energy facilities 
additionally  income  losses and cash flows are allocated to the members based on their initial capital account balances until hancock and cit achieve targeted returns  thereafter  the amounts will be allocated to hancock and cit and to us 
we do not expect hancock and cit to achieve the targeted returns in we account for the underlying leases as operating leases 
the remaining aggregate lease commitments are million related to these waste to energy facilities 
under the llc agreements  if we exercise certain renewal options under the leases  we will be required to make capital contributions to the llcs for the difference  if any  between fair market rents and the scheduled renewal rents 
we are required under certain circumstances to make capital contributions to the llcs in the amount of the difference between the stipulated loss amounts and termination values under the llc agreements to the extent they are different from the underlying lease agreements 
we believe that the occurrence of these circumstances is remote 
we are the manager of the llcs but there are significant limitations on the powers of the manager per the llc agreements 
accordingly  we account for our interest in the llcs under the equity method of accounting 
these investments have a carrying value of approximately million at both december  and  respectively 
if we were required to consolidate the llcs  we would record approximately million in assets  and million of debt as of december  the remaining balance which would be recorded is primarily minority interest 
during and  the llc received lease payments of million and million respectively  from the three waste to energy facilities and made distributions during the same periods to members of the llcs of million and million  respectively 
seasonality and inflation our operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months  which corresponds with our first and fourth quarters 
this is mostly because i the volume of construction and demolition waste is lower in the winter because there is less construction activity and ii the volume of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where the company operates tends to decrease during the winter months 
we do not believe that inflation has  nor do we expect it to have  any material adverse effect on our results of operations in the near future 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for business combinations sfas no 
 and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the pooling of interests method for business combinations initiated after june  according to sfas no 
 goodwill that arises from purchases after june  cannot be amortized 
in addition  sfas no 
requires the continuation of the amortization of goodwill and all intangible assets through december   but provides that amortization of existing goodwill will cease on january  entities must use their current goodwill impairment approach through december   and begin to apply the new impairment approach on january  sfas no 
requires a two step impairment approach for goodwill 
companies must first determine whether goodwill is impaired and if so  they must value that impairment based on the amount by which the book value exceeds the estimated fair value 
companies have six months from the date they initially apply sfas no 
to test goodwill for impairment and any impairment charge resulting from the initial application of the new rule must be classified as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
thereafter  goodwill should be tested for impairment annually and impairment losses should be presented in the operating section of the income statement unless they are associated with a discontinued operation 
in those cases  any impairment losses will be included  net of tax  within the results of discontinued operations 
during  all of our business combinations were accounted for by using the purchase method of accounting 
in accordance with our adoption of sfas no 
 we will continue to use the purchase method of accounting for our business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have not amortized goodwill from any acquisitions that occurred after june  we have no intangible assets  other than goodwill  that will cease being amortized upon adoption of sfas we have recalculated our basic and diluted earnings per share for  and excluding goodwill amortization  as follows dollars in millions years ended december  reported net income loss add back goodwill amortization  net of taxes adjusted net income loss basic earnings per common share reported net income loss goodwill amortization  net of taxes adjusted net income loss diluted earnings per common share reported net income loss goodwill amortization  net of taxes adjusted net income loss the effect of adopting sfas no 
will also require us to write off net negative goodwill of approximately million  which will be recorded as a credit to cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle in the first quarter of in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit  which is defined as a company s operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
for the purposes of applying sfas no 
 we have defined our reporting units to be our six individual nasw areas and our nasw recycling operations that are not included in any of our nasw areas 
although we currently expect no impairment of goodwill upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
 there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
or at any time subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
covers all legally enforceable obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and provides the accounting and reporting requirements for such obligations 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning january  our management has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
which supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting method for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and extends the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no 
also requires that an impairment loss be recognized for assets held for use when the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable 
the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group  excluding interest charges 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset group must incorporate the entity s own assumptions about its use of the asset group and must factor in all available evidence 
sfas no 
is effective for us on january  as of december   the primary components within our operations held for sale were certain non solid waste operations  certain nasw operations and our surplus real estate portfolio 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 any held for sale operations that do not meet sfas no 
criteria must be classified as held for use 
we expect million of held for sale assets to not meet sfas no 
criteria 
these assets will be reclassified to held for use in the first quarter of this reclassification will have no earnings impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates  certain commodity prices and certain equity prices 
from time to time  we and certain of our subsidiaries use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
our derivatives are simple agreements with independent third parties that provide for payments based on the notional amount  with no multipliers or leverage 
as of december   all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions  with the exception of two derivatives related to the pulp and paper commodity markets that were entered into for trading purposes 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivatives 
however  we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the credit worthiness of the counterparties  all of whom we either consider credit worthy  or who have issued letters of credit to support their credit worthiness 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on the handling of the enron north america corp 
enron waste paper swap agreements 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our company s market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate exposure 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations  which are mainly denominated in us dollars 
in addition  we generally use interest rate swaps to either lock in or limit the variability in the interest expense of certain floating rate debt obligations or to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations 
an instantaneous  one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions at december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
this analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items  such as new borrowings  nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
since a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless our fixed rate debt would need to be refinanced at maturity 
commodities price exposure 
we market recycled paper products like old newspaper onp and old corrugated containers occ 
we started entering into financial swaps in in an effort to mitigate the risk of recyclable paper price fluctuations 
under these financial swap agreements  we generally transfer a floating market price for a fixed price for a fixed period of time 
we and the counterparty agree to use a market index as an indicator of the market price during the term of the swap 
at december   all  except two  of our waste paper swap agreements were with enron 
due to enron s financial situation  collectibility of the funds associated with these instruments is not probable at december  and therefore these instruments were estimated to have no fair value 
the derivatives with enron were subsequently terminated in early the net fair value of two derivatives entered into for trading purposes was thousand at december  and therefore not material 
equity price exposure 
we are also subject to equity price exposure from our debt issues that are convertible into our own common stock 
these debt issues had an aggregate carrying value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
an instantaneous  ten percent decrease in our stock price on december  and would decrease the fair value to a third party holder of our convertible debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
the exposure at december  has been substantially reduced due to the maturity and our payment of million to redeem our convertible subordinated notes due on february  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments
