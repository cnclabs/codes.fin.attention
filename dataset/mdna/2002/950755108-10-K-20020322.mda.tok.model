item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition critical accounting policies the company s success depends on its ability to efficiently manage its resources in the delivery of truckload transportation services to its customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
the company s ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is a key element in efficiently deploying resources and in making capital investments in trucks and trailers 
although the company s business volume is not highly concentrated  the company may also be affected by the financial failure of its customers or a loss of a customer s business from time to time 
the company s greatest resource requirements include qualified drivers  trucks  trailers  and related costs of operating its equipment such as fuel  driver pay  insurance  and supplies and maintenance 
the company has historically been successful mitigating its risk to increases in fuel prices by recovering additional fuel surcharges from its customers 
the company s financial results are also affected by availability of qualified drivers and the market for new and used trucks 
because the company is self insured for cargo  personal injury  and property damage claims on its trucks and for workers compensation benefits for its drivers supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  the weather  the legal and regulatory environment  and the costs of insurance coverage to protect against catastrophic losses 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for liability and physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and long term are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of income and expense items to operating revenues for the years indicated 
operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits fuel supplies and maintenance taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation rent and purchased transportation communications and utilities other total operating expenses operating income net interest expense and other income before income taxes income taxes net income the following table sets forth certain industry data regarding the freight revenues and operations of the company 
operating ratio average revenues per tractor per week      average annual miles per tractor      average miles per trip average revenues per total mile average revenues per loaded mile non trucking revenues in thousands      average tractors in service      total tractors at year end company      owner operator    total tractors      total trailers at year end      net of fuel surcharge revenues 
compared to operating revenues increased over  due primarily to a increase in the average number of tractors in service 
revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  increased primarily due to customer rate increases  and revenue per total mile  including fuel surcharges  increased compared to fuel surcharges  which represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel  decreased from million in to million in due to lower average fuel prices see fuel explanation below 
excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased over revenue from non trucking transportation services increased million compared to freight demand during was soft due to a weaker us economy as compared to however  the company developed its freight base and utilized its proprietary technology so that it experienced only a decrease in its average annual miles per tractor 
the company s empty mile percentage increased slightly  by one tenth of one percentage point from to 
the company s operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues increased from in to in the decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles in compared to in  contributed to a shift in costs from the rent and purchased transportation expense category as described on the following pages 
owner operators are independent contractors who supply their own tractor and driver  and are responsible for their operating expenses including fuel  supplies and maintenance  and fuel taxes 
over the past year  it has been more difficult to attract and retain owner operator drivers due to the weaker used truck pricing market  higher fuel prices  and weaker economy 
salaries  wages and benefits increased from to of revenues due in part to a higher percentage of company drivers as compared to owner operators and an increase in the number of drivers in training 
workers compensation and health insurance expense increased due to rising medical costs and higher weekly state workers compensation payment rates 
in recent years  workers compensation and health insurance costs have been increasing at rates higher than inflation  and this is expected to continue 
these increases were partially offset by an improvement in the tractor to non driver employee ratio  which lowered non driver labor costs per mile 
the market for attracting company drivers improved during  however  the company anticipates that the competition for qualified drivers will continue to be high  and cannot predict whether it will experience shortages in the future 
if such a shortage was to occur and increases in driver pay rates became necessary to attract and retain drivers  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases were not obtained 
fuel decreased from to of revenues due to lower fuel prices  principally in the fourth quarter of the average price per gallon of diesel fuel  excluding fuel taxes  was approximately 
per gallon lower in versus the average price per gallon in fourth quarter was approximately 
per gallon lower than the average price for the year of and was about the same as the average historical fuel price levels over the past ten years 
the company s customer fuel surcharge reimbursement programs have historically enabled the company to recover most of the higher fuel prices from its customers compared to normalized average fuel prices 
these fuel surcharges  which automatically adjust from week to week depending on the cost of fuel  enable the company to rapidly recoup the higher cost of fuel when prices increase 
conversely  when fuel prices decrease  fuel surcharges decrease 
after considering the amounts collected from customers through fuel surcharge programs  net of reimbursements to owner operators  earnings per share increased by approximately 
over due to lower fuel costs 
shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
the company is unable to predict whether fuel prices will continue to decrease or will increase in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance increased from to of revenues due to a higher percentage of company drivers compared to owner operators during and more maintenance services performed over the road than at company facilities 
insurance and claims increased from to of revenues due to unfavorable claims experience in and higher excess insurance premiums 
insurance premiums in the liability insurance market have increased significantly for many truckload carriers in recent months 
for over ten years  the company has been self insured and managed virtually all of its liability  cargo  and property damage claims with qualified risk department professionals 
as a result  higher liability insurance rates have had a less significant effect on the company  impacting the company only for catastrophic claim coverage 
the company renewed its annual catastrophic liability insurance coverage effective august   and the effect of the increase in premiums was less than of the company s total annual insurance and claims expense 
the company s premium rate for liability coverage up to million per claim is fixed through august   while coverage levels above million per claim will be renewed effective august  rent and purchased transportation expense decreased from to of revenues because of a decrease in payments to owner operators of revenue in compared to in  offset by an increase in purchased transportation relating to remaining non trucking operations following the transfer of most of the company s logistics business to transplace 
the decrease in payments to owner operators resulted from the decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total company miles as discussed above 
the company has experienced difficulty recruiting and retaining owner operators because of high fuel prices  a weak used truck pricing market  and other factors 
this has resulted in a reduction in the number of owner operator tractors from  as of december   to  as of december  the company reimburses owner operators for the higher cost of fuel based on fuel surcharge reimbursements collected from customers 
other operating expenses changed from a credit of to an expense of of revenues due in part to a weak market for the sale of used trucks 
record levels of trucks manufactured during and  an increased supply of used trucks caused in part by trucking company business failures  and slower fleet growth by many carriers have all contributed to a decline in the market value of used trucks 
during  the company traded about two thirds of its used trucks and sold about one third to third parties 
for trucks traded  the excess of the trade price over the net book value of the trucks reduced the cost basis of new trucks 
in  the company traded half of its used trucks and sold half of its used trucks to third parties through its fleet truck sales retail network and realized gains of million 
in  due to a lower average sale price per truck  the company realized losses of million 
the company renegotiated its trade agreements with its primary truck manufacturer in june and continued to expand its nationwide retail truck sales network in response to the weak used truck market 
other operating expenses were also impacted by increasing the allowance for uncollectible receivables for the company s maximum credit exposure related to the fourth quarter enron bankruptcy of approximately million 
the company has limited credit exposure for the first quarter kmart bankruptcy 
the company has focused on improving its collections of accounts receivable  as such  days sales in accounts receivable decreased from days as of december   to days as of december  net interest expense and other decreased from to of revenues due to lower interest expense  offset partially by the company s share of transplace operating losses 
interest expense decreased from to of revenues due to a reduction in the company s borrowings 
average debt outstanding in was million versus million in in  the company recorded a loss of approximately million as its percentage share of estimated transplace losses versus a gain of approximately million in the company is recording its approximate investment in transplace using the equity method of accounting and is accruing its percentage share of transplace s earnings and losses as an other non operating item 
the company s effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was and in and  respectively  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the effective income tax rate for the period decreased due to the implementation of certain tax strategies 
the company expects the income tax rate to be the tax rate in effect for compared to operating revenues increased over  due to an increase in the average number of tractors in service  a increase in average revenue per mile excluding fuel surcharges  and a increase in revenues due to fuel surcharges 
customer rate increases were the primary factor in the increase in average revenue per mile excluding fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were collected from customers in to recover a majority of the increase in fuel expense caused by higher fuel prices 
the company s operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues increased from to 
salaries  wages and benefits decreased from to of revenues by maintaining the average payroll cost per mile while at the same time increasing average revenue per mile 
offsetting this  workers compensation expense increased due to rising medical costs and higher weekly state workers compensation payment rates 
fuel increased from to of revenues due to substantially higher fuel prices 
the average price per gallon of diesel fuel  excluding fuel taxes  was higher in than the company implemented customer fuel surcharge programs to recover a majority of the increased fuel cost 
taxes and licenses decreased from to of revenues due to higher revenue per mile 
on a cost per mile basis  taxes and license expenses were about the same 
insurance and claims decreased slightly from to of revenues 
improved liability claims experience was offset by increased cargo claims 
depreciation decreased from to of revenues due to higher revenue per mile 
on a cost per mile basis  depreciation was slightly higher 
rent and purchased transportation expense increased from to of revenues due primarily to increases in rental expense on leased tractors of revenue in compared to in and payments to owner operators of revenue in compared to in 
payments to owner operators increased slightly in compared to caused in part by an increase in owner operator miles as a percentage of total company miles 
on a per mile basis  payments to owner operators increased due to amounts reimbursed by the company to owner operators for the higher cost of fuel 
increases in logistics and other non trucking transportation services in the first half of offset the decrease in the latter half of the year due to transferring most of the company s logistics business to transplace on june  the company is one of five large truckload transportation companies that contributed their logistics businesses to this commonly owned  internet based logistics company 
the company transferred logistics business representing about of total revenues for the six months ended june   to transplace 
other operating expenses changed from to of revenues due to a weak market for the sale of used trucks 
during  the company traded more of its used trucks  and the excess of the trade price over the net book value of the trucks reduced the cost basis of new trucks 
in  the company sold most of its used trucks to third parties through its fleet truck sales retail network and realized gains of million 
in  due to a reduced number of trucks sold to third parties and a lower average gain per truck  the company realized gains of million 
the company s effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was in and  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in the increase million in operating cash flows from to was due primarily to higher depreciation due to the growth of the company truck fleet million  increased deferred taxes due to the implementation of certain tax strategies and growth of the company truck fleet million  a small loss versus gains on disposal of operating equipment due to a weaker used truck pricing market million  increased long term insurance and claims accruals million  decreases in other long term assets million  and working capital improvements million 
the cash flow from operations enabled the company to make capital expenditures and repay debt as discussed below 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in the growth of the company s business has required significant investment in new revenue equipment 
net capital expenditures in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the capital expenditures in and were financed primarily with cash provided by operations and  to a lesser extent in  borrowings 
capital expenditures were higher in due to the company s completion of various construction projects including the laredo  texas terminal  the dallas  texas terminal expansion  and the driver training facility 
the company also invested million in transplace in as of december   the company has committed to approximately million of net capital expenditures  which is a small portion of its estimated capital expenditures 
net financing activities used million in and million in and generated million in in and respectively  the company made net repayments of million and million of debt compared to net borrowings of million in the company paid dividends of million in  million in  and million in financing activities also included common stock repurchases of million in and million in from time to time  the company has and may continue to repurchase shares of its common stock 
the timing and amount of such purchases depends on market and other factors 
the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares 
as of december   the company has purchased  shares pursuant to this authorization 
the company s financial position is strong 
as of december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of debt  and million of stockholders equity 
based on the company s strong financial position  management foresees no significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in millions long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial total amounts commitments committed less than year years years over years in millions unused lines of credit standby letters of credit other commercial commitments total commercial commitments the unused lines of credit are available to the company in the event the company needs financing for the growth of its fleet 
with the company s strong financial position  the company expects it could obtain additional financing  if necessary  at favorable terms 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for insurance policies 
the other commercial commitments relate to committed equipment expenditures  which is a small portion of planned equipment expenditures for inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on the company s operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates  fuel  wages  and other costs to increase and could adversely affect the company s results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
year issue the impact of the year issue on the company s operations was insignificant 
forward looking statements and risk factors this discussion and analysis contains historical and forward looking information 
the forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company believes the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements are reasonable based on information currently available  however any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and therefore  actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risks and uncertainties 
those risks include  but are not limited to  the following the company s business is modestly seasonal with peak freight demand occurring generally in the months of september  october  and november 
during the winter months  the company s freight volumes are typically lower as some customers have lower shipment levels after the christmas holiday season 
the company s operating expenses have historically been higher in winter months primarily due to decreased fuel efficiency  increased maintenance costs of revenue equipment in colder weather  and increased insurance and claims costs due to adverse winter weather conditions 
the company attempts to minimize the impact of seasonality through its marketing program by seeking additional freight from certain customers during traditionally slower shipping periods 
bad weather  holidays  and the number of business days during the period can also affect revenue  since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of trucking companies 
this competition could limit the company s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability 
the company competes primarily with other truckload carriers 
railroads  less than truckload carriers  and private carriers also provide competition  but to a lesser degree 
competition for the freight transported by the company is based primarily on service and efficiency and  to some degree  on freight rates alone 
the company is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact customer shipping volumes 
the general slowdown in the economy during had a negative effect on freight volumes for truckload carriers  including the company 
as the unemployment rate increased  driver availability improved for the company and the industry 
fuel prices increased beginning in fourth quarter and were high through and before decreasing in the latter part of shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the company 
to the extent that the company cannot recover the higher cost of fuel through customer fuel surcharges  the company s results would be negatively impacted 
future economic conditions that may affect the company include employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  interest rates  and tax rates 
the company is regulated by the united states department of transportation dot 
this regulatory authority establishes broad powers  generally governing activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  financial reporting  and other matters 
the company may become subject to new or more comprehensive regulations relating to fuel emissions  driver hours of service  or other issues mandated by the dot 
for example  new engine emissions standards are to become effective for truck engine manufacturers in october these new engines have not yet been available for adequate testing 
these new engines may be more costly and less fuel efficient 
at times  there have been shortages of drivers in the trucking industry 
although the market for attracting company drivers improved during due to the higher domestic unemployment rate and other factors  the company anticipates that the competition for company drivers will continue to be high 
during  it became more difficult to recruit and retain owner operator drivers due to the weak used truck pricing market and higher fuel prices for most of the year 
the company anticipates that the competition for company drivers and owner operator drivers will continue to be high and cannot predict whether it will experience shortages in the future 
the company is highly dependent on the services of key personnel including clarence l 
werner and other executive officers 
although the company believes it has an experienced and highly qualified management group  the loss of the services of these executive officers could have a material adverse impact on the company and its future profitability 
the company is dependent on its vendors and suppliers 
the company believes it has good relationships with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors and suppliers 
if the company fails to maintain good relationships with its vendors and suppliers or if its vendors and suppliers experience significant financial problems  the company could face difficulty in obtaining needed goods and services because of interruptions of production or for other reasons  which could adversely affect the company s business 
the efficient operation of the company s business is highly dependent on its information systems 
much of the company s software has been developed internally or by adapting purchased software applications to the company s needs 
the company has purchased redundant computer hardware systems and has its own off site disaster recovery facility approximately ten miles from the company s offices to use in the event of a disaster 
the company has taken these steps to reduce the risk of disruption to its business operation if a disaster were to occur 
the company self insures for liability resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  and property damage as well as workers compensation 
this is supplemented by premium insurance with licensed insurance companies above the company s self insurance level for each type of coverage 
to the extent that the company was to experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost per claim  the company s operating results would be negatively affected 
the company maintains a three year replacement cycle on its tractors 
the company sells tractors to third parties or trades tractors to manufacturers to maintain a new truck fleet 
used truck pricing for three year old tractors has declined by approximately  to  per tractor from to year end in  the company realized gains on sales of tractors of million or per share  resulting from used truck prices that were in excess of the company s net book value for those trucks 
for the last half of  used truck pricing for three year old tractors was approximately the same as the company s net book value for those trucks 
should the used truck pricing market become significantly worse and the company decided to sell trucks at a loss rather than extend the life of its trucks  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
also  the company currently trades a portion of its three year old tractors to its primary tractor manufacturer at fixed prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to negotiate comparable trade agreements in future years  which may require the company to sell more of its trucks to third parties using the company s retail truck sales network 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements made herein  since the statements speak only as of the date they are made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company s only outstanding debt at december   was million of fixed rate debt 
interest rates on the company s unused credit facilities are based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
increases in interest rates could impact the company s annual interest expense on future borrowings 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  and other market factors 
historically  the company has been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the company cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will occur in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
the company conducts business in mexico and canada 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the company s results of operations for and prior years 
accordingly  the company is not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on the company s future costs or on future cash flows 
to date  the company receives payment for freight services performed in mexico and canada primarily in us dollars to reduce foreign currency risk
