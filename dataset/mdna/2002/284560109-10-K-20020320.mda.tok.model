these leases generally take the form of percentage  minimum or fixed rents 
lease payments are recognized as revenue when earned  based on the provisions of the underlying leases

the proceeds of million were used to reduce the balance outstanding under the company s credit facility 
working capital deficit was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the working capital deficit at december  compared to was primarily due to the inclusion in current liabilities of three mortgages secured by four properties with unpaid principal balances totaling million that will mature in december the company has the right to extend the maturity of each of these mortgages for two additional years upon the payment of an aggregate extension fee of  subject to the requirement that the mortgages are not then in default and that the lender has determined that there has been no material adverse change in the condition  financial  physical or otherwise  of the property  or the borrower or any guarantor or indemnitor since november and that the performance of the property is consistent with its performance as of november the repayment of principal and interest on these mortgage loans is non recourse to the company 
however  if the maturity date of these mortgages is not extended by the lender and the lender foreclosed on the properties securing the mortgages  the company would lose the properties and the revenues it derives from the properties 
at december   the properties had a book value of million

based on the significant reduction during in the amount outstanding under the credit facility and the company s payment history  the company believes that it will be successful in negotiating a further extension of the credit facility that will enable it to pay off all amounts outstanding under the credit facility within a reasonable period of time 
if the company is unable to negotiate a further extension of the credit facility or obtain replacement financing by august   or for any other reason the operating partnership were to be in default under the credit facility prior to its maturity  deutsche bank could exercise its right to foreclose on the collateral securing the credit facility  which could have an adverse affect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company s management believes that available cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to satisfy the company s short term working capital needs other than the repayment of amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
the current economic recession  combined with the net reduction in medicare reimbursement levels during and after  which resulted in a significant curtailment of the willingness of banks to extend loans secured by healthcare related real estate  has adversely impacted the debt and equity markets for healthcare related companies 
the company depends on these markets to fund its long term liquidity needs 
the company s ability to access the capital and credit markets will likely be significantly limited until such time as these markets improve 
the company does not have sufficient cash flow to repay indebtedness if its creditors require immediate repayment of these amounts or if the collateral underlying these amounts is insufficient to cover the outstanding balances 
as of december   the company had shareholders equity of million and credit facility borrowings and mortgages  bonds and notes payable  including notes payable to third parties  aggregating million  which represents a debt to equity ratio of to this was a decrease from to at december  this decrease was due primarily to a net decrease of million in such indebtedness and a net increase in shareholders equity of million 
the net decrease in third party indebtedness resulted primarily from repayments of third party indebtedness aggregating million and repayments under the credit facility of million 
the net increase in shareholders equity primarily resulted from stock options exercised during the year of million  and net income aggregating million for credit facility the company has a line of credit agreement with deutsche bank 
the credit facility is secured by properties with an aggregate book value of million 
effective january   the credit facility was extended to august  the fourth amendment and the covenants amended to  in part  cure the then existing covenant violations 
in connection with the extension of the term of the credit facility to august   the fourth amendment to the credit facility a prohibited the company from further borrowings under the facility  b required the company to make monthly principal payments equal to the cash flow generated by the company for the month  not to be less than  a month and c prevented the company from paying distributions in excess of of that amount required to maintain reit status 
with respect to the fourth amendment  the company issued warrants to the lender to purchase  common shares at per share 
these warrants expire december  the amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to over one month libor and the previously required monthly facility fee has been eliminated 
the effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  was 
at december   the company had million outstanding under the credit facility 
the company is currently making monthly principal and interest payments to deutsche bank  equal to its monthly cash flow  not to be less than  a month 
at december   the credit facility was secured by properties with a book value of approximately million 
substantially all of the company s other assets at december  secure other outstanding indebtedness of the company 
the terms of the credit facility extension reduced the company s cash flows and impose limits on its ability to make distributions to its shareholders 
future increases in interest rates  as well as any defaults by tenants on their leases could adversely affect the company s cash flow and its ability to pay its obligations 
to qualify as a reit  the company must distribute to its shareholders each year at least of its net taxable income  excluding any net capital gain 
if the company is unable to make any required shareholder distributions  then the company may be unable to qualify as a reit and be subject to federal income taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s bonds payable and most of the company s mortgages payable bear interest at fixed rates 
the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its credit facility and variable rate mortgages 
the company utilizes interest rate cap provisions within its debt agreements to limit the impact that interest rate fluctuations have on its variable rate mortgages 
the company does not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or any other type of derivative financial instruments 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the underlying indebtedness  but not earnings or cash flows 
the company generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity without premium 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until the company would be required to refinance such debt 
the maturity schedule for the company s fixed rate mortgages and bonds payable is as follows in thousands thereafter  at december   the fair value of the company s fixed rate mortgages and bonds payable approximates its carrying value of million 
for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
at december   the fair value of the company s variable rate debt approximates its carrying value of million 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and variable rate mortgages was at december  assuming the credit facility and variable rate mortgage balances outstanding at december  of million remains constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates from at december  would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a rate of over the one month libor 
variable rate mortgages bear interest at over one month libor 
the company may borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future 
increases in interest rates  therefore  would result in increases in interest expenses  which could adversely affect the company s cash flow and its ability to pay its obligations and make distributions to shareholders at current levels
