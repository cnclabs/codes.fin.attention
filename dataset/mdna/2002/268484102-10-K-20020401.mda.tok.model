compared to revenue 
revenue decreased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in primarily due to decreases in air freight forwarding revenue 
net revenue  which represents revenue less freight transportation costs  decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in air freight forwarding revenue 
air freight forwarding revenue decreased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in primarily as a result of volume decreases in north america and asia 
the volume decreases in north america were primarily attributable to the weakened us economy 
north america was also adversely affected by the shift from air expedited shipments next flight out  next day or second day time definite shipments to economy ground deferred shipments third and fourth day 
air freight forwarding net revenue decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in the air freight forwarding margin net revenue as a percentage of revenue declined to in as compared to for due to a softening of the us economy  primarily in the technology  telecommunications and automotive industries  and the resulting shift from air expedited shipments to economy ground deferred shipments which generate lower revenue and lower margins 
the air freight forwarding margin was also adversely impacted in by the fixed costs of transportation related to charter aircraft leases mainly utilized in north america which were carrying less freight than targeted operating levels as a result of the factors discussed in the previous sentence 
in june  we paid million to terminate one of our air charter lease agreements 
in mid august  we negotiated agreements to reduce our exposure to future losses on leased aircraft 
a lease for two of the aircraft was terminated with no financial penalty  and we agreed to sublease five aircraft on another lease to a third party at rates below our contractual commitment  which resulted in a charge in of approximately million 
as of december   we were obligated under one lease agreement for four aircraft that expires during although asia experienced lower revenues from lower activity  the air freight forwarding net revenue margin for asia improved due to better buying opportunities from carriers 
ocean freight forwarding revenue 
ocean freight forwarding revenue decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily as a result of volume decreases in north america and asia 
ocean freight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million in compared to million in due to increased direct activity volumes in europe  coupled with lower transportation costs in asia  north america and europe for consolidation services 
activity from expanded operations in france resulting from a joint venture with the mory group contributed to the improved results in europe 
the ocean freight forwarding margin increased to in compared to in primarily due to an increase in the number of shipments moving on a direct basis rather than through consolidation services and  to a lesser extent  better buying opportunities on consolidation activity 
customs brokerage and other revenue 
customs brokerage and other revenue  which includes warehousing  distribution and other logistics services  decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in  while net customs brokerage and other revenue increased million  or  to million in compared to million in customs brokerage revenue was lower in due to a decrease in inbound traffic in all geographic segments except europe and middle east 
activity from substantially expanded operations in france and ireland and the opening of a wholly owned subsidiary in south africa significantly contributed to the higher revenues in the europe and middle east segment 
warehousing and distribution revenue increased as a result of new and expanded warehousing customers mainly in north america partially offset by a decline in activity in asia 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses personnel and other selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding eeoc legal costs and transaction  restructuring and integration costs were not reduced commensurate with the decline in revenue during the early part of in anticipation of improved activity levels 
additionally  actions taken during to add additional warehouse and dock space in anticipation of continued market share gains and growth in activity resulted in higher occupancy related expenses that came on line during we also added significant it related consultant expenses during to develop an integration plan and to begin the integration of the egl and circle it systems 
the combination of a delay in implementing reductions in personnel related expenses consistent with the lower activity levels  the addition of warehouse and dock space that started in and higher it related expenses contributed to our losses in personnel costs include all compensation expenses  including those relating to sales commissions and salaries and to headquarters employees and executive officers 
personnel costs increased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of net revenue  personnel costs were  in compared to in our history of rapid revenue growth has historically required us to increase our headcount at a fast pace to prepare for increased levels of activity to maintain our high level of customer service 
as a result  employee headcount increased throughout and into early in anticipation of efforts to integrate and grow in connection with the egl circle merger 
when freight shipments began to slow toward the end of the first quarter of  we attempted to alleviate the impact of the slowdown by implementing a furlough program in march with no strong signs of a near term economic rebound  we reduced our headcount during the remainder of to bring it in line with then current activity levels 
during  approximately regular full time and contract employees were released  including the former circle headquarters employees 
these reductions represented approximately of our us workforce 
in the europe and middle east region  headcount was increased by due to new and expanded operations in france  ireland and south africa 
the associated compensation expenses were the main cause of the increase in our total personnel costs 
we implemented a temporary salary reduction for five pay periods during the first quarter of for salaried personnel in the us in an effort to decrease personnel costs during our seasonally slow first quarter 
other selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding eeoc legal costs and transaction  restructuring and integration costs  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of net revenue  other selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding eeoc legal costs and transaction  restructuring and integration costs  were in compared to in this increase is due to an overall increase in the level of our activities during and the first nine months of without the corresponding net revenue growth in due to the reduced shipping volumes and the shift from air expedited shipments to economy ground deferred shipments which generate lower revenue at lower margins  but with a similar cost structure 
eeoc legal settlement 
in  we entered into an agreement to settle a claim with the eeoc and recorded a charge of million during the third quarter  which included million placed into a settlement fund  million to establish a leadership development program  legal fees  administrative costs and other costs associated with the litigation and settlement 
the million charge was in addition to the million charge we recognized in for the estimated costs of defending against these claims 
transaction  restructuring and integration costs 
primarily in connection with the circle merger  we recorded merger related costs of million  or million after tax  during and million  or million after tax  during the categories of costs incurred  the actual cash payments made in and and the accrued balances at december  and are summarized below in thousands amounts paid accrued balance revisions to amounts paid accrued balance written off in at december  new charges estimates written off in at december  total cash costs transaction costs   severance costs      future lease obligations  net of expected sublease income        termination of joint venture agency agreements       charter lease obligation  net of sublease income   integration costs      subtotal cash cost       noncash   total        transaction costs 
transaction costs of million incurred in include investment banking  legal  accounting and printing fees and other costs directly related to the merger 
severance costs 
severance costs were recorded for certain employees at the former circle headquarters and former circle management at certain international locations who were terminated or notified of their termination under our integration plan prior to december  as of december   we no longer employed approximately of the employees included in the integration plan we established in connection with the circle acquisition 
the termination of substantially all of the remaining employees occurred in the first quarter of additional severance costs of approximately million were recorded during the year ended december  also  during january  we announced an additional reduction in our workforce of approximately additional employees 
the charge for this workforce reduction is approximately million and was recorded during the first quarter of future lease obligations 
future lease obligations consist of our remaining lease obligations under noncancelable operating leases at domestic and international locations that we are in the process of vacating and consolidating due to excess capacity resulting from having multiple facilities in certain locations 
the provisions of our integration plan include the consolidation of facilities of approximately of our operating locations 
as of december   consolidation of facilities has been completed at substantially all of these locations with the remaining locations expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of during the second half of  we determined the estimated consolidation dates for several of the remaining facilities and recorded an additional charge of million 
all lease costs for facilities being consolidated are charged to operations until the date that we vacate each facility 
amounts recorded for future lease obligations under our integration plan are net of approximately million in anticipated future recoveries from actual or expected sublease agreements 
sublease income has been anticipated under the integration plan only in locations where sublease agreements have been executed as of december  or are deemed probable of execution during the first half of there is a risk that subleasing transactions will not occur within the same timing or pricing assumptions made by us or at all  which could result in future revisions to these estimates 
during the year ended december   we recorded an additional charge of million based on revised estimates for future recoveries from actual or expected sublease agreements that were or are expected to be less favorable than anticipated due to the weakened us economy 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we decided to utilize two of the facilities in our logistics operations as we determined the expected return on operations was greater than the sublease income we expected to obtain in these two markets 
therefore  we reversed the million reserve established for these facilities 
termination of joint venture agency agreements 
costs to terminate joint venture agency agreements represents contractually obligated costs incurred to terminate selected joint venture and agency agreements with certain of our former business partners along with assets that are not expected to be fully recoverable as a result of our decision to terminate these agreements

we completed the termination of joint venture agreements in south africa and taiwan on more favorable terms than originally expected and revised the related estimate by reducing the expected charge by million 
charter lease obligation 
in august  we negotiated agreements to reduce our exposure to future losses on leased aircraft 
a lease for two of the aircraft was terminated with no financial penalty 
we subleased five aircraft to a third party at rates below our contractual commitment and recorded a charge of approximately million in the third quarter of for the excess of our commitment over the sublease income through the end of the lease term 
as of december   we are obligated under one lease agreement with miami air one of our equity method investees for four aircraft 
this agreement expires during integration costs 
integration costs of approximately million and million were incurred during and  respectively  and include the costs of changing legal registrations in various jurisdictions  changing signs and logos at our major facilities around the world  and other integration costs 
these costs have been expensed as incurred 
approximately million of this amount was unpaid at december  noncash charge 
the noncash charge of million in consists of assets not expected to be recoverable  which include a fixed assets at various locations that will no longer be used in our ongoing operations after we consolidate those locations  b computer hardware and software at the former circle operations that will no longer be used as these assets are not compatible with our existing information technology strategy  and c assets not expected to be fully recoverable as a result of our decision to terminate certain joint venture agency agreements 
in  we revised these estimates by approximately million for assets that were determined to be recoverable since they will continue to be used in operations 
operating income loss 
an operating loss of million was incurred in as compared to operating income of million for the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decline in net revenues of million and the million increase in other selling general and administrative expenses  offset by a million reduction in transaction  restructuring and integration costs 
nonoperating income expense  net 
nonoperating expense  net of million was incurred in as compared to nonoperating income  net of million in during  nonoperating expense  net resulted from a lower level of interest income resulting from reduced short term investments that were liquidated to fund expansion activities and support operations  higher interest expense from increased borrowings  losses from unconsolidated affiliates and no benefit of net foreign exchange gains 
these were partially offset by a million gain recognized on recording the market value of an investment that became marketable during the second quarter of and a lower expense for recognition of minority interests

the increase in asia pacific resulted from the consolidation of a formerly unconsolidated affiliate in taiwan 
for the twelve months ended december   taiwan reported air freight forwarding revenue and net revenue of million and million  respectively 
south america benefited from our acquisition of compass cargo limitada  a privately held air freight forwarder in chile in december which contributed air freight forwarding revenue and net revenue of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  the air freight forwarding margin declined to in compared to in due to higher carrier costs  which included fuel surcharges and start up costs associated with a new dedicated leased aircraft servicing the us asia market

liquidity and capital resources general our ability to satisfy our debt obligations  fund working capital and make capital expenditures depends upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we substantially reduced operating costs between the second and third quarter of and worked to diversify our customer base 
additionally  we made significant efforts to collect outstanding customer accounts receivable amounts and were able to use the cash from these collections to avoid additional net borrowings on our line of credit during the latter part of if we achieve significant near term revenue growth  we may experience a need for increased working capital financing as a result of the difference between our collection cycles and the timing of our payments to vendors 
we make significant disbursements on behalf of our customers for transportation costs primarily ocean and customs duties 
the billings to customers for these disbursements  which are several times the amount of revenue and fees derived from these transactions  are not recorded as revenue and expense on our statement of operations  rather  they are reflected in our trade receivables and trade payables

the amended and restated credit facility includes a million letter of credit subfacility 
we had million in standby letters of credit outstanding as of december  under this facility 
the maximum amount that we can borrow at any particular time may be less than the amount of our revolving credit line because we are required to maintain a specified amount of borrowing availability under the amended and restated credit agreement based on our eligible borrowing base 
the required amount of borrowing availability is currently million  which amount is subject to adjustment to million if certain post closing conditions are satisfied 
the required amount of borrowing availability is subject to further adjustment to million if our ebitda is million for the fiscal quarter ended december   million for the fiscal quarter ending march  or million for the fiscal quarter ending june  the amount of borrowing availability is determined by subtracting the following from our eligible borrowing base our borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility  and our accounts payable and the accounts payable of all of our domestic subsidiaries and our canadian operating subsidiary that remain unpaid more than the longer of i sixty days from their respective invoice dates or ii thirty days from their respective due dates

we refer to borrowings bearing interest based on libor as a libor tranche and to other borrowings as a prime rate tranche 
the interest on a libor tranche is payable on the last day of the interest period one  two or three months  as selected by us for such libor tranche 
the interest on a prime rate tranche is payable monthly 
a termination fee would be payable upon termination of the amended and restated credit facility during the first two years after the closing thereof  in the amount of of the total revolving line commitment if the termination occurs on or before the first anniversary of the closing and of the total revolving line commitment if the termination occurs after the first anniversary  but on or before the second anniversary of such closing unless terminated in connection with a refinancing arranged or underwritten by bank of america or its affiliates

no amounts were outstanding under this agreement as of march  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our credit agreement prior to december  other bank lines of credit and guarantees 
we maintain a million bank line of credit  in addition to the million sublimit under our amended and restated credit facility  to secure customs bonds and bank letters of credit to guarantee certain transportation expenses in foreign locations 
at december   we were contingently liable for approximately million  under outstanding letters of credit and guarantees related to our million line of credit

additionally several of our foreign operations guarantee amounts associated with our custom brokerage services 
as of december   these outstanding guarantees approximated million 
sale leaseback 
on december   we terminated an operating lease agreement relating to our corporate headquarters facility in houston  texas and purchased the property covered by this agreement for million 
in connection with the termination of the lease agreement and the purchase of the property  we entered into a transaction whereby we sold this property and certain other properties in houston and denver owned by us with a net book value of million to an unrelated third party for million  net of closing costs of million 
mr 
crane also conveyed his ownership in a building adjacent to the houston facility directly to the buyer and received approximately million in proceeds 
mr 
crane s investment in the building was approximately million 
one of our subsidiaries then leased these properties for a term of years  with options to extend the initial term for up to an additional years 
under the terms of the new lease agreement  the quarterly lease payment is approximately million  which amount is subject to escalation after the first two years based on increases in the consumer price index 
synthetic lease agreements 
we have entered into two operating lease arrangements that involve a special purpose entity that acquired title to properties  paid for the construction costs and leased to us real estate at some of our terminal and warehouse facilities 
this kind of leveraged financing structure is commonly referred to as a synthetic lease 
a synthetic lease is a form of lease financing that qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment and under generally accepted accounting principles is not reflected in our balance sheet 
thus  the obligations are not recorded as debt and the underlying properties are not recorded as assets on our balance sheet 
under a synthetic lease  our rental payments which approximate interest amounts under the synthetic lease financing are treated as operating rent commitments and are excluded from our aggregate debt maturities 
a synthetic lease is generally preferable to a conventional real estate lease since the lessee benefits from attractive interest rates  the ability to claim depreciation under tax laws and the ability to participate in the development process 
master operating synthetic lease 
on april   we entered into a five year million master operating synthetic lease agreement with two unrelated parties for financing the acquisition  construction and development of terminal and warehouse facilities throughout the united states as designated by us 
the lease facility was funded by a financial institution and is secured by the properties to which it relates 
construction was completed during on five terminal facilities 
under the terms of the master operating synthetic lease agreement  average monthly lease payments  including monthly interest costs based upon libor plus basis points  begin upon the completion of the construction of each financed facility 
the monthly lease obligations currently approximate million per month 
a balloon payment equal to the outstanding lease balances  which were initially equal to the cost of the facility  is due in november as of december   the aggregate lease balance was approximately million 
if these facilities were consolidated in our financial statements  we would reflect an increase in property and equipment and in indebtedness of approximately million and the annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
we intend to enter into alternative financing arrangements for these facilities prior to november the master operating synthetic lease agreement contains restrictive financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to and specified amounts of consolidated net worth and consolidated tangible net worth 
in addition  the master operating synthetic lease agreement as amended on february  restricts us from incurring debt in an amount greater than million  except pursuant to a single credit facility involving a commitment of not more than million and million of convertible subordinated notes 
we have an option  exercisable at anytime during the lease term  and under particular circumstances may be obligated  to acquire the financed facilities for an amount equal to the outstanding lease balance 
if we do not exercise the purchase option  and do not otherwise meet our obligations  we are subject to a deficiency payment computed as the amount equal to the outstanding lease balance minus the then current fair market value of each financed facility within limits  up to a maximum of million 
we expect that the amount of any deficiency payment would be expensed 
we may also have to find other suitable facilities to operate in or potentially be subject to a reduction in revenues and other operating activities 
other synthetic lease and related capital lease 
during  circle entered into two lease agreements related to one of its domestic terminal facilities 
one of the lease agreement relates to the land and is currently being accounted for as a synthetic operating lease 
we are required to make bi annual payments of million for years under the synthetic lease 
at december   the lease balance was approximately million 
a second agreement relates to the building and improvements and is accounted for as a capital lease rather than as a synthetic lease 
therefore  the fixed asset and related liability for the second lease are included in our balance sheet 
property under the capital lease is amortized over the lease term 
as of december   the carrying value of property held under the building and improvements lease was million  which is net of million of accumulated amortization 
computer system upgrades 
we are in the process of developing and implementing computer system solutions for operational and financial systems 
as of december   we had capitalized million related to the development of these systems 
this amount is currently not being depreciated 
once placed in service  depreciation related to the systems will be charged

please read certain relationships and related transactions miami air for information on our investment in miami air  including miami air s efforts to renegotiate its loan obligations and lease commitments with its creditors given the status of the airline industry as a result of the events of september and the weak economy 
share repurchase 
in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of our outstanding common stock 
in april  our board of directors increased the authorization to three million shares 
our intention has been that repurchases would help to offset increases in the number of shares outstanding resulting from previous and future stock option exercises

at the time a non qualified stock option is exercised  we will generally be entitled to a deduction for federal and state income tax purposes equal to the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the date of exercise and the option price 
as a result of exercises for the fiscal years ended december  and december  of non qualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of million and million shares of common stock  we are entitled to a federal income tax deduction of approximately million and million  respectively

investment in miami air international  inc in july  we purchased of the outstanding common stock of miami air international  inc  a privately held domestic and international passenger and freight charter airline headquartered in miami  florida  for approximately million in cash in a stock purchase transaction 
our primary objective for engaging in the transaction was to develop a business relationship with miami air in order to obtain access to an additional source of reliable freight charter capacity 
in the transaction  certain stockholders of miami air sold of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of miami air common stock to private investors  including egl  james r 
crane and frank j 
hevrdejs  a member of our board of directors 
mr 
crane purchased of the outstanding common stock for approximately million in cash  and mr 
hevrdejs purchased of the outstanding common stock for approximately million in cash 
in connection with the miami air investment  miami air and egl entered into an aircraft charter agreement whereby miami air agreed to convert certain of its passenger aircraft to cargo aircraft and to provide aircraft charter services to egl for a three year term  and we caused a million standby letter of credit to be issued in favor of certain creditors for miami air to assist miami air in financing the conversion of its aircraft 
miami air agreed to pay egl an annual fee equal to of the face amount of the letter of credit and to reimburse egl for any payments owed by egl in respect of the letter of credit 
as of december  miami air had no funded debt under the line of credit that is supported by the egl letter of credit 
however  miami air had outstanding million in letters of credit that were supported by the egl letter of credit 
there were previously four aircraft subject to the aircraft charter agreement 
during  we paid miami air approximately million under the aircraft charter agreement for use of four cargo airplanes under an aircraft  crew  maintenance and insurance  or acmi  arrangement 
the payments were based on market rates in effect at the time the lease was entered into 
in late february  egl and miami air mutually agreed to ground one of these aircraft because of the need for maintenance on that plane 
we are negotiating with miami air to reduce the costs of operating the remaining three aircraft and are further exploring opportunities to reduce our dependence on those planes 
we have been made aware of miami air s efforts to renegotiate its loan obligations and lease commitments with their creditors given the status of the airline industry as a result of the events of september and the weak economy 
if miami air is not able to successfully reach agreement with its creditors  or if its business continues to decline  we would expect to reassess the carrying value of our million common stock investment in miami air the result of which may be an impairment charge and may be required to perform on our credit support million outstanding as of march  against a million standby letter of credit on behalf of miami air the result of which may be the recognition of a related loss 
the weak economy and events of september significantly reduced the demand for cargo plane services  particularly cargo planes 
as a result  the market value of these planes declined dramatically 
miami air has made egl aware that the amounts due their bank which are secured by seven planes is significantly higher than the market value of those planes 
in addition  miami air has outstanding operating leases for and airplanes at above current market rates  including two planes that are expected to be delivered in miami air has indicated that they are in discussions with the bank to obtain debt concessions on the seven planes  to buy out the lease on a cargo plane and to reduce the rates on the passenger planes 
an offer from a third party to purchase three of the cargo planes being leased by egl is also being evaluated by miami air 
if the three cargo planes are sold  egl expects that it would be released from its lease obligations 
miami air has informed egl that its creditors have indicated a willingness to make concessions 
there can be no assurance as to the amount  timing or terms of such concessions  if any 
miami air is interested in exiting the business to concentrate primarily on passenger business 
miami air believes its business model is viable if it is able to exit the business this division s cost structure  pricing and scale are no longer competitive  obtain concessions from its bank and lessors  and focus on passenger business

seasonality historically  our operating results have been subject to a limited degree to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
the first quarter  ending march  has traditionally been the weakest  and the third quarter  ending september  has traditionally been the strongest 
this pattern is the result of  or is influenced by  numerous factors  including climate  national holidays  consumer demand  economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces 
in addition  this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of our terminal network 
we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors  nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor 
as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns  if any  will continue in future periods 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls  and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements 
management must apply significant judgment in this process 
among the factors  but not fully inclusive of all factors that may be considered by management in these processes are the range of accounting policies permitted by us generally accepted accounting principles  management s understanding of the company s business both historical results and expected future results  the extent to which operational controls exist that provide high degrees of assurance that all desired information to assist in the estimation is available and reliable or whether there is greater uncertainty in the information that is available upon which to base the estimate  expectations of the future performance of the economy domestically  globally and within various sectors that serve as principal customers and suppliers of goods and services  expected rates of change  sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates  whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends  future estimates of cash flows to be produced by various assets and groups of assets  how long assets are expected to remain productive before they must be replaced or undergo substantial repairs  what the fair market value of an asset or liability may be at a point in time when there is no established trading market where the specific asset or liability can be readily sold or settled  expectations regarding the financial viability of counterparties to business transactions with us and the counterparties ability  willingness and whether they actually will perform in accordance with their business obligations under the terms of the arrangements  in some circumstances management judgment must be applied to interpret what the provisions of commercial arrangements obligate the parties to do and estimates are sometimes required of the efforts and cost necessary to meet those obligations or to resolve disputes among the parties  including the costs related to resolving litigation  expectations of future income for financial and income tax reporting purposes to evaluate the recoverability of certain assets  and and the categorization and allocation of costs among different categories reported in the financial statements  as well as estimates of reasonable pricing assumptions used in our segment reporting analysis 
the estimation process often times may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that lies within that range of reasonable estimates which may result in the selection of estimates which could be viewed as conservative or aggressive by others based upon the quantity  quality and risks associated with the variability that might be expected from the future outcome and the factors considered in developing the estimate 
management attempts to use its business and financial accounting judgment in selecting the most appropriate estimate  however  actual results could and will differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenue and freight consolidation costs are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin  one of the permissible methods authorized by emerging issues task force issue no 
revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process 
this method generally results in recognition of revenue and gross profit earlier than methods that do not recognize revenue until a proof of delivery is received 
customs brokerage and other revenues are recognized upon completing the documents necessary for customs clearance or completing other fee based services 
revenue recognized as an indirect air carrier or an ocean freight consolidator includes the direct carrier s charges to egl for carrying the shipment 
revenue recognized in other capacities includes only the commission and fees received 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulleting sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and related interpretative guidelines in november the provisions of sab no 
had no material impact on our financial statements 
computer software we account for internally developed software using the guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this standard requires that certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
this sop also requires that costs related to the preliminary project stage  data conversion and the post implementation operation stage of an internal use computer software development project be expensed as incurred 
upon retirement or sale of assets  the cost of such assets and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss  if any  is credited or charged to income 
we have incurred substantial costs during and related to a number of information systems projects that were being developed during that time period 
inherent in the capitalization of those projects are the assumptions that after considering the technological and business issues related to their development  such development efforts will be successfully completed and that benefits to be provided by the completed projects will exceed the costs capitalized to develop the systems 
management believes that all projects capitalized at december  and will be successfully completed and will result in benefits recoverable in future periods 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill  representing the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  and other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the period of expected benefit  not exceeding years 
goodwill is a residual amount and is determined after numerous estimates are made regarding the fair values of assets and liabilities included in a business combination  and therefore  indirectly affected by management s estimates and judgments 
accumulated amortization as of december  and  was million and million  respectively 
impairment of assets the carrying value of long lived assets  including goodwill  is reviewed periodically based on the projected undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or the business unit over the remaining amortization period 
if the cash flow analysis indicates that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds related undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value will be reduced to the estimated fair value of the assets or the present value of the expected future cash flows 
substantial judgment is necessary in the determination as to whether an event or circumstances have occurred that may trigger an impairment analysis and in determination of the related cash flows from the asset 
estimating cash flows related to long lived assets is a difficult and subjective process that applies historical experience and future business expectations to revenues and related operating costs of assets 
should impairment appear to be necessary  subjective judgment must be applied to estimate the fair value of the asset  for which there may be no ready market  which oftentimes results in the use of discounted cash flow analysis and judgmental selection of discount rates to be used in the discounting process

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and net income are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through operational actions 
we provide services to customers in locations throughout the world and  as a result  operate with many functional currencies including the key currencies of north america  latin america  asia  the south pacific and europe 
this diverse base of local currency costs serves to partially counterbalance the effect of potential changes in the value of our local currency denominated revenues and expenses 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are related primarily to intercompany transactions 
the duration of these exposures is minimized through the use of an intercompany netting and settlement system that settles the majority of intercompany obligations two times per month 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under our line of credit 
our lease payments on certain financed facilities are tied to market interest rates 
at december   a rise in the base rate for these financing arrangements would not have a material impact on operating income in we have not purchased any material futures contracts nor have we purchased or held any material derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during in the second quarter of  we entered into contracts for the purpose of hedging the costs of a portion of anticipated jet fuel purchases for chartered aircraft during the following twelve months 
these contracts matured in the second quarter of such contracts were nominally insignificant 
in april  we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement  which was designated as a cash flow hedge  to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on million of our libor based revolving credit facility or any substitutive debt agreements we enter into 
in december  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due december  the proceeds from these notes substantially retired the libor based debt outstanding under the then existing revolving credit agreement 
the interest rate on the convertible notes is fixed  therefore  the variability of the future interest payments has been eliminated 
the swap agreement no longer qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting and has been undesignated as of december  the net loss on the swap agreement included in other comprehensive income loss as of december  was million and will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the swap agreement and changes in fair value of the swap agreement will be recorded in interest expense 
exchange rate sensitivity the following tables provide comparable information about our non functional currency components of balance sheet items by currency  and presents such information in us dollar equivalents at december  and these tables summarize information on transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
the net amount that is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates is then subjected to a change in the value of the functional currency versus the non functional currency
