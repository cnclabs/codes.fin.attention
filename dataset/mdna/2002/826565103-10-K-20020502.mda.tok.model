the following discussion includes forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  about the markets in which we operate and our business and prospects  including statements about the sufficiency of our current reserve of cash and cash equivalents  our short term investments and our bank lines of credit to meet our working capital requirements  and the effect of interest rate changes on the value of our short term investments  our bank lines of credit and our foreign currency cash balances 
these statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties which may result in different or disappointing future business and financial results 
many of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in this report  including under factors affecting future operating results 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended january   our net revenues decreased to million from million reported for fiscal this decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to the continuing slowdown of the general economic conditions  and the continuing decline in demand for our mpeg chipset and board products in pc add in market due to the prevalence of dvd enabling software provided as original equipment in many pcs 
even though overall total net revenues from sales of mpeg chipset and board products were significantly decreased year over year  revenues from sales of our new streaming video console and board products to commercial streaming video market and sales of our chipset products to consumer appliance market increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal our revenues from sales of streaming video console and board products for the commercial steaming video market and sales of chipset products in the set top boxes for the consumer appliance market represented a relatively significant portion of our total net revenues while our revenues from sales of chipset and board products to pc add in market represented a relatively insignificant portion of our total net revenues for fiscal the continuing decline in demand for chipsets and boards in pc add in market  the slower than anticipated emergence of the set top box market  and delays in the deployment of streaming video applications which utilize our products may continue 
should they continue  this decline and these delays would continue to reduce our revenues and harm our business 
net loss for the fiscal year ended january  was million as compared to net loss of million for the prior fiscal year 
the net loss for fiscal was primarily caused by the decline in revenues 
the net loss for fiscal included a charge of approximately  of impairment losses related to an investment of a start up company  and a specific provision for bad debt allowance in the amount of approximately  net of recovery  due to collectibility issues relating to one of our customers 
the net loss for fiscal included a charge of million to write down certain pc dvd and video networking related inventories due to the decline in demand for those products  and a provision for bad debt allowance in the amount of million due to collectibility issues relating to one of our customers and non payment by another customer for customization services that we provided 
the following table shows certain items as a percentage of net revenues  which are included in our consolidated statement of operations fiscal fiscal fiscal net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative other income expense net income loss dividends on preferred stock net income loss available to common shareholders net revenues the following table sets forth our net revenues in each product group for the last three years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal boards    chipsets    other    total net revenues    our board level product lines are targeted at oem customers to address the dvd upgrade market and system integrators to address the computer based training  kiosks  and corporate video on demand markets 
our chipsets are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume oem customers building interactive multimedia products for business and consumer markets 
the other category includes our new product  netstream consoles for the commercial streaming video market  set top box products and accessories targeted at the consumer internet information appliance market a market which we entered in fiscal  and development revenues under agreements for the customization of certain mpeg decoding chips 
the costs related to development revenues were included in research and development expenses 
the table below sets forth our revenues by market segment for each of the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal commercial streaming video market    consumer appliance market    pc add in market    other market  total net revenues    revenues from sales to commercial streaming video market accounted for of our net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal revenues from sales to consumer appliance market accounted for of our net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal pc add in market accounted for of our net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal revenues from sales to other market accounted for of our net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal revenues from sales to commercial streaming video market increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue from sales to consumer appliance market increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from pc add in market decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from other market decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenues from sales of our products to commercial streaming video market in fiscal as compared to fiscal is mainly attributable to increased sales of our mpeg board products and the introduction of our new console products in corporate streaming video market 
we expect our revenues from commercial streaming video market to continue to fluctuate year over year primarily due to the project oriented nature of sales of our products to our corporate streaming video market 
the increase in revenues from sales of our products to consumer appliance market in fiscal is attributable to increased sales of our mpeg chipset products to set top box manufacturers 
the consumer appliance market remains in an emerging phase and we expect fluctuating revenues to continue 
the decrease in revenues from sales of our products to pc add in market in fiscal is due to the continuing decline in demand for products in the pc add in market 
we expect our revenues from pc add in market to be relatively insignificant in future periods as a result of our decision to focus on the video on demand and consumer appliance market 
the category other market in the above table consists of development fees under agreements relating to the development for customization of certain mpeg decoding chip technology and accessories for projects and products for various market segments 
the overall decrease in net revenues from other market in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to a decrease in development fees due to fewer development projects and the increasingly complex nature which requires longer development time 
we expect that net revenues from other market will continue to fluctuate 
the table below sets forth our revenues by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal united states    asia    europe    canada other regions total net revenues    our us revenues as a percentage of total net revenues were in fiscal  in  and in fiscal total us revenues in fiscal decreased to million  from million in fiscal total asia revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal total asia revenues in fiscal decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal total europe revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal total europe revenues in fiscal increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal our asia revenues were derived predominantly from customers in taiwan 
revenues generated from taiwan in fiscal accounted for of our total net revenues  as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal three customers based in u 
s and one customer based in europe accounted for of our total net revenues in fiscal  as compared to two customers based in u 
s and three customers based in asia accounting for of our total net revenues in fiscal and three customers based in asia accounting for of our total net revenues in fiscal the overall year to year decrease in revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to the global economic downturn and the continuing decline in demand of our pc dvd upgrade products in the pc market

gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal excluding development revenues of million  the gross margin was approximately in fiscal this increase was a result of increased sales of our products to streaming video market and chipset products to the set top box consumer appliance market which have relatively high gross margins and the decreased sales of our products to pc add in market which have relatively low gross margins 
we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in the mix of product sales and provisions for inventory obsolescent 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses increased  or in fiscal over fiscal this increase was largely due to increased headcount and expenses associated the expansion of our product marketing and sales development group 
the same expenses decreased  or  in fiscal over fiscal the decrease was the result of a reduction of our business development group personnel  an elimination of outside public relations services  and reduced sales commissions in connection with reduced revenues 
we believe that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods as we intend to increase headcount in our sales and marketing organization and to expand our product marketing and sales development 
research and development expenses increased  or in fiscal over fiscal and  or in fiscal over fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily attributable to additional engineering staff at our headquarters as well as at our development center in france  consulting services  and capital equipment related to product development 
the increase in fiscal was largely due to increases in technical development support  and the research and development center established in france during the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect to continue our efforts in the development of our proprietary mpeg based products  and research and development expenses will likely increase accordingly year over year 
our general and administrative expenses decreased million or in fiscal from fiscal the decrease was mainly attributable to the significant reduction of approximately million of bad debt expense from last fiscal year 
excluding the specific provision for bad debt of approximately  net of recovery  and million respectively  in fiscal and  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was comparable to fiscal the same expense increased million or in fiscal from fiscal excluding provision for bad debt of approximately million in fiscal  general and administrative expenses decreased  or as compared to fiscal the decrease was largely due to the refund by our insurance company of costs previously expensed related to a shareholder lawsuit resolved in fiscal and reduction of legal expenses in general 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase relatively in future periods due to the continually increasing cost of insurance  professional services and other expenditures associated with our business 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  and short term investments of million  a decrease of million compared with million at january  this decrease resulted from operating activities that utilized cash of approximately million  acquisition of fixed assets of  repayment of capital lease obligations of  and cash used for other investing activities of  which was partially offset by proceeds of  from the issuance of our common stock under our stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
as of january   we had million outstanding under a million bank revolving line of credit that expires in october  bears interest at the u 
s treasury bill rate at january  plus  and is collateralized by funds on deposit in accounts that have been assigned to the lender and is included in our consolidated balance sheet at january  as restricted cash 
we also have a million bank line of credit available that expires in october and is collateralized by our accounts receivable  inventories  equipment  and intangibles 
as of january   we had utilized  of the standby letter of credit under this second line of credit 
the lines of credit contain certain covenants that  among other things  required us to maintain certain levels of tangible net worth plus subordinated debt based on our projected operating results 
at january   we were required to maintain total net equity worth of at least million 
as of that date  we were not in compliance with this covenant and subsequently obtained a modification to amend this covenant to million 
our primary sources of funds to date have been cash generated from operations  proceeds from preferred and common stock issuances  capital lease arrangements  and bank borrowings under lines of credit 
it is likely that our operation will continue to consume cash in the foreseeable future 
based on our cash projection  we believe that our current reserve of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital requirements and other cash needs for the next twelve months 
in addition  we believe that we will be able to comply with or make modifications to the current covenants to maintain the availability of funds under our existing asset based banking agreements 
to insure that we have adequate working capital  we intend to raise additional funding through either public or private offerings of our common or preferred stock or from additional bank financing during the next twelve months 
there is no assurance that such capital will be available to us 
the estimate of time our cash and other resources will last is a forward looking statement that is subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below  as well as other factors  and actual results may differ as a result of such factors 
factors affecting future operating results our annual and quarterly results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly due to a number of factors  including but not limited to new product introductions by us and our competitors  the ability of our realmagic mpeg silicon to compete with other technologies in these merging markets  market acceptance of the technology embodied in our products generally and our products in particular  customer acceptance of our products  shifts in demand for the technology embodied in our products generally and our products in particular and or those of our competitors  gains or losses of significant customers  reduction in average selling prices and gross margins  which may occur either gradually or precipitously  inventory obsolescence  write downs of accounts receivable  an interrupted or inadequate supply of semiconductor chips or other materials for example  our source of supply for silicon wafers was interrupted in fiscal  and may continue to be interrupted in the future because of earthquakes in taiwan  our inability to protect our intellectual property  loss of key personnel  technical problems in the development  ramp up  and manufacture of products causing shipping delays  and availability of third party manufacturing capacity for production of certain of our products 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to the asia pacific region  a region of the world that is subject to increased economic instability 
there can be no assurance that such instability will not have a material adverse effect on our future international revenues 
any adverse change in the foregoing or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
due to the factors noted above  our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends of future periods 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
additionally  we may not learn of such shortfall until late in a fiscal quarter  which could result in even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
further  we operate in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in volatility of our common stock price 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  and inventories 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenues consist of product and development revenue 
revenues from product sales to oems  distributors and end users are generally recognized upon shipment  except that revenues are deferred when the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of returns or where collectibility is not assured  deferred revenue is recognized when collection subsequently becomes probable and returns are estimable generally upon resale by customers 
allowances for sales returns  price protection and warranty costs are recorded at the time that revenues are recognized 
revenues from product development agreements are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts 
any revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which the need for revisions becomes evident 
we classify all development costs related to such agreements as research and development expenses 
development revenues were  million  and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
account receivable during industry downturns  certain of our customers have difficulty with their cash flows 
for certain customers  typically those with whom we have long term relationships  may delay their payments by days beyong the original terms 
we review the ability of our customers to pay the indebtedness they incur with us 
we defer recognition of revenue and related receivable when we cannot reasonably estimate collectibility is assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for all specific receivables that we judge to be unlikely for collection 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against which we have not established a specific reserves 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding customer s credit worthiness known to us 
in fiscal and  we recorded a provision for general and specific bad debt allowance in the total amount of  net of recovery of  and million respectively 
inventories with the dramatic decrease in revenue during fiscal and  we continue to monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and expectations of an eventual market upturn 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventories if the current industry downturn extends further into the future than we have currently estimated or we make changes in our current product development plans 
we estimate inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based on our assessments of future product sales giving considerations for factors such as the cyclical nature of our industry 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to see demand for current and further products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change adversely  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need to further write down inventory

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our operations and financial condition 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
at january   we held  in short term investments consisting of us government and corporate debt securities with an average original maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at january   the fair market value of the short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
we generally expect to have the ability to hold our investments until maturity and therefore would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates for short term investments 
at january   we had million outstanding under a million variable interest rate bank line of credit  no borrowing outstanding under a million variable interest rate bank line of credit and utilized  of standby letter of credit under this second line of credit 
if short term interest rates were to increase percent  the increased interest expense associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on our net income and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity 
the hong kong dollar and euro are the financial currencies in our subsidiaries in hong kong and france 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do maintain cash balances denominated in the hong kong dollar and euro 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by percent from the exchange rate at january   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
