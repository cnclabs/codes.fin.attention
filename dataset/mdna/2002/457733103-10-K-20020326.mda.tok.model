item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion below contains forward looking statements regarding our financial condition and results of operations that are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires inspire management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
inspire evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our future results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  any such forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in the section entitled risk factors 
significant accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue under our collaborative research and development agreements when we have performed services under such agreements or when we or our collaborative partner has met a contractual milestone triggering a payment to us 
non refundable fees received at the initiation of collaborative agreements for which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of ongoing research and clinical development commitment 
we are also entitled to receive milestone payments under our collaborative research and development agreements based upon achievement of development milestones by us or our collaborative partners 
we recognize milestone payments as revenues ratably over the remaining period of our research and clinical development commitment 
the recognition period begins at the date the milestone is achieved and acknowledged by the collaborative partner  which is generally at the date payment is received from the collaborative partner  and ends on the date that we have fulfilled our research and clinical development commitment 
this period is based on estimates by management and the progress towards milestones in our collaborative agreements 
the estimate is subject to revision as our development efforts progress and we gain knowledge regarding required additional development 
revisions in the commitment period are made in the period that the facts related to the change first become known 
this may cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period 
taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event the actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
overview we were incorporated in october and commenced operations in march following our first substantial financing 
since that time  we have been engaged in the discovery and development of novel pharmaceutical products that treat diseases which are characterized by deficiencies in the body s innate defense mechanisms of mucosal hydration and mucociliary clearance as well as other diseases 
our technologies are based in part on exclusive license agreements with the university of north carolina at chapel hill for rights to certain developments from the founders laboratories 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to discovery and clinical development of our product candidates as well as establishing strategic partnerships for the development and potential marketing of our products when approved 
currently  we have six product candidates in clinical development 
we have not derived any commercial revenues from product sales and we do not expect to receive sales revenues for at least the next several years 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have primarily financed our operations through proceeds received from the sale of equity securities including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial public offering  as well as revenues received under corporate collaborations 
we operate in a single business segment and do not have any foreign operations 
in june  we entered into a joint license  development and marketing agreement with allergan to develop and commercialize ins ophthalmic and allergan s restasis r 
under the agreement  we may receive up to million in up front and milestone payments 
we will also receive royalty payments on sales  if any  of ins ophthalmic in the united states and on allergan s restasis r worldwide  excluding most asian markets 
the agreement also provides for potential co promotion by inspire of ins ophthalmic and restasis r and one or more of allergan s other marketed products in the united states 
in september  we entered into a license agreement with kirin for the development and commercialization of ins diagnostic 
under the agreement we granted kirin an exclusive license to commercialize ins diagnostic in most of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an upfront payment in cash and may receive milestone payments based on clinical success and approval 
in december  we entered into a collaboration with genentech to develop treatments for respiratory disorders  pursuant to which we received in excess of million in equity and cash payments prior to the termination of the agreement in november upon termination  genentech returned to us all rights for the use of ins respiratory and our other related py agonist at no charge 
in december  we entered into a development  license and supply agreement with santen for the development of ins ophthalmic for the therapeutic treatment of ocular surface diseases 
we are obligated to supply santen with its requirements of ins ophthalmic in bulk drug substance form for all preclinical studies  clinical trials and commercial requirements at agreed upon prices 
under the agreement  we received an up front equity investment of million for shares of our stock 
in addition  if all milestones are met  we could receive additional payments of up to million  as well as royalties on net sales of licensed products 
we have not received any milestone payments to date under the agreement 
in september  we entered into a joint development  license and supply agreement with kissei for the development of ins respiratory for therapeutic lower respiratory applications in japan 
pursuant to the agreement with kissei  we received an up front payment of million  which included the purchase of shares of our stock 
in addition  if all milestones under the agreement are met  we would receive additional payments of up to million 
we will also receive royalties on net sales  if any  of licensed products 
to date  we have received million in milestone payments 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues our revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million in and million in revenues in each year were derived primarily from collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners 
under these agreements we received payments based both on our achievement  and our partners achievement  of defined development milestones 
milestone payments from our collaborative partners are recognized over the period of ongoing research and development commitment under the applicable collaborative research and development agreements with the respective companies 
the increase in revenues relate to milestone payments received pursuant to the execution of a license  development and marketing agreement with allergan in the third quarter of the increase in revenues in over relate to milestone payments received from genentech and kissei in the fourth quarter of and the milestone payments received from genentech  kissei and kirin during costs and expenses research and development expenses include all direct costs  including salaries for our research and development personnel  consulting fees  clinical trial costs  sponsored research and clinical trials insurance  and other fees and costs related to the development of product candidates 
costs associated with obtaining and maintaining patents on our drug compounds  and license initiation and continuation fees  are evaluated based on the stage of development of the related drug compound and whether the underlying compound has an alternative use 
costs of these types incurred for drug compounds not yet approved by the fda and for which no alternative use exists are recorded as research and development expense 
in the event the drug compound has been approved by the fda or an alternative use exists for the drug compound  patent costs and license costs are capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the related drug compound 
milestone payments are recognized when the underlying requirement is met by us 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in the increase in research and development expenses from year to year reflect the continued advancement of our drug candidates through progressive clinical development phases 
we expect expenditures to decrease in as we focus our development efforts on our higher priority programs 
the increase in research and development expense for over was primarily due to increased external costs related to patent activities  research costs  preclinical testing  toxicology studies  clinical development activities  including the enrollment of phase iii clinical trials  and increased internal costs associated with additional personnel necessary to perform or manage these activities 
the increase in research and development expense for over relates to increased preclinical testing  costs related to patent activities  toxicology studies  increased clinical development activities and associated increases in personnel costs 
our research and development expense from inception through december  was million 
of this amount  we have spent the following amounts on the pre clinical and clinical development of the indicated product candidates million on ins diagnostic  million on ins ophthalmic  million on ins respiratory  million on ins respiratory for cystic fibrosis  million on ins intranasal and million on ins ophthalmic 
the balance of our historic research and development expenses  million  was spent on various discovery programs and other development programs 
we cannot reasonably predict future research and development expense for these programs 
general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including business development  finance  accounting  legal  human resources  facilities and information systems 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from year to year resulted primarily from increases in administrative personnel costs  and increases in insurance and additional professional services  including legal  accounting and public relations services  to support the company s strategic business collaborations and operations as a publicly traded company 
other income expense other income expense  net totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for the increase in over  and in over  was due to higher interest income earned from larger average cash and investment balances partially offset by increased interest expense related to leased equipment and amortization of debt issuance costs 
income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  compared to  in and  in the fluctuations in the provision for income taxes are directly attributable to japanese withholding taxes paid on milestone payments received from japanese collaborative partners 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial public offering 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million as compared to december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted from approximately million in cash used by operations  purchase of property  plant and equipment of  the payments of notes payable of  and the payments of capital lease obligations of  which was partially offset by the proceeds of net investments in investment grade securities of million and the issuance of common stock of  cash used by operations of million for the year ended december   represented the net loss of million  non cash expenses of million  an increase of  in accounts payable  an increase of  in accrued expenses  a decrease of  in receivables and a decrease in other assets of  partially offset by decreases of  in prepaid expenses and million in deferred revenue 
cash used in our investing activities for the year ended december  was comprised of the proceeds of investment grade securities  net of maturities  of million and the purchase of property and equipment totaling  cash from our financing activities for the year ended december  was comprised of proceeds in the amount of  from the issuance of common stock partially offset by the payments of notes payable of  and the payment of capital lease obligations of  we do not expect to generate revenues  other than possible license and milestone payments  from the commercial sale of our products unless and until we or our licensees receive marketing clearance from the fda and appropriate regulatory agencies in other countries 
we cannot predict the timing of any potential marketing clearance nor can assurances be given that the fda or other such agencies will approve any of our product candidates 
the company has contractual commitments or purchase arrangements with various clinical research organizations  manufacturers of drug product and others 
most of these arrangements are for a period of less than months 
the amount of the company s financial commitments under these arrangements totals approximately at december  this estimate is dependent upon the results of the underlying studies and certain other variable components that may yield a result that differs from management s estimate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense it must pay with respect to various outstanding debt instruments 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to capital lease obligations 
the interest rates are closely tied to market rates and our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point drop in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  or december  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase interest expense
