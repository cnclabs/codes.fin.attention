overview we design and market broadband communications equipment that enables telephone companies and other communications service providers to cost effectively deliver a full suite of voice  data and video services over the existing copper wire telephone infrastructure 
we commenced operations in july and recorded our first sale in september from january until november  we operated through next level communications lp  which was formed in connection with the transfer of all of the net assets  management and workforce of a wholly owned subsidiary of general instrument 
in november  the business and assets of that partnership were merged into next level communications  inc as part of our recapitalization 
in january  general instrument was acquired by motorola  inc  making us an indirect subsidiary of motorola 
we generate our revenues primarily from sales of our equipment 
a small number of customers have accounted for a large part of our revenues to date  and we expect this concentration to continue in the future 
qwest  formerly u s west  accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and our agreements with our largest customers do not obligate the customers to purchase any products 
in addition  our significant customer agreements generally contain fixed price provisions 
as a result  our ability to generate a profit on these contracts depends upon our ability to produce and market our products at costs lower than these fixed prices 
the timing of our revenues is difficult to predict because of the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products 
customers view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  customers typically undertake significant evaluation  testing and trial of our products before deploying them 
this evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from nine months to more than a year 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order  if at all  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management efforts 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues in decreased to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in equipment sales to qwest 
an equipment revenue analysis by channel is detailed in the following chart 
our equipment revenue is analyzed using three channels independent operating companies ioc  major carriers which currently include qwest and other north american regional bell operating companies major carriers and other customers which include  among others  multiple service organizations and international customers other 
fiscal year ended december  channel in millions ioc major carriers primarily qwest other total equipment revenue sales to qwest were significantly reduced in due to an overall reduction in capital spending by qwest 
additionally  qwest has slowed its purchases of our equipment while it re evaluates its plans regarding the deployment of vdsl across its network 
the re evaluation by qwest is continuing  and sales to qwest in the future are dependent upon its decision regarding the deployment of our products 
sales to iocs and our other customers decreased in due to a general slowdown in the telecommunications industry and the resulting reduction of our customers capital expenditures 
we expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of equipment to regional bell operating companies and local  foreign and independent telephone companies for the foreseeable future 
revenue levels in future quarters will depend significantly upon qwest s future decisions and general economic conditions  as well as whether and how quickly our existing customers roll out broadband services in their coverage areas and whether and how quickly we obtain new customers 
cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in our cost of revenues in was primarily attributable to inventory charges taken in the year totaling million related to excess inventory  obsolescence and lower of cost or market adjustments 
included in and cost of revenues are inventory charges totaling million and million 
excluding the inventory charges  cost of revenues were million and million in and the decrease was primarily due to lower sales of equipment 
to meet forecasted demand and reduce the anticipated component supply constraints that had existed in the past  in late we increased inventory levels for certain components and entered into purchase commitments for certain components with long lead times 
however  in the quarter ended june   our estimates of forecasted sales in and for our current generation of products declined significantly 
as a result  inventory related charges were required and were calculated based upon i the substantial completion of the negotiation process with our contract manufacturers and their suppliers and our other vendors regarding purchase commitments and cancellations made by us  ii the inventory levels in excess of forecasted demand and iii our estimates of salvage or recovery value for each raw material or finished good on an item by item basis 
we do not currently anticipate that the excess inventory included in this provision will be used based on our current demand forecast 
at december   we updated our estimates and recorded an additional inventory charge 
these write downs were included in cost of revenues in and consisted of the following in millions excess quantities of raw materials on hand or under purchase commitments  net of salvage excess quantities of finished goods on hand  net of salvage obsolescence cancellation charges on purchase commitments lower of cost or market write down on current generation product platform total significant estimates included in the calculation of the inventory write downs above include forecasted demand for our products  sales prices for residential gateways and other finished goods and estimated salvage or recovery value for excess raw materials and finished goods 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and therefore additional inventory write downs may be necessary in future periods 
during  we recorded a million inventory write down primarily related to a lower of cost or market adjustment to certain residential gateway products and other obsolescence provisions 
excluding the inventory charges in both and  our gross margin percentage decreased to in from in the decline in our gross margin percentage was primarily related to spreading the manufacturing overhead elements of product cost over reduced sales volumes 
in the future  gross margin percentage may fluctuate due to a wide variety of factors  including customer mix  product mix  the timing and size of orders which are received  the availability of adequate supplies of key components and assemblies  our ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  the timing of new product introductions or announcements by us or our competitors  price competition and unit volume 
our overhead reductions and the improved product cost attributes of our new standards compliant product platform are intended to improve the gross margin percentage in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in the research and development expenses was primarily due to cost cutting measures  including a reduction in research and development personnel  implemented in the current year 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million the increase was attributable to increased goodwill amortization arising from the purchase of softprose in july and higher recruiting and relocation expenses in the first half of the year 
we reduced our workforce in october and january by approximately and 
non cash compensation charge 
substantially all of our employees in were granted contingently exercisable stock options that became options to purchase our common stock upon our recapitalization in in addition  tandem stock options were granted in january to some of our employees 
as a result  non cash compensation expense was recognized upon the completion of our initial public offering based on the difference between the exercise price of these options and the initial public offering price of our common stock 
the non cash compensation expense related to these option grants in was million 
there was no such expense in  and we do not expect any such expenses to be material in the future 
asset impairments and disposals  net 
asset impairments and disposals in consisted of i the write off of goodwill related to softprose of million  ii loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment and other assets of million and iii the gain on sale of our software product line of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income expense  net 
interest expense was million in interest income was million in interest expense in included non cash interest expense of million related to our loan agreement with motorola 
interest income in related primarily to interest earned on our initial public offering proceeds 
other income expense  net 
other expense in was million  and was primarily related to the write down of certain long term investments in virtual access of million  million in outreach communications and million in expanse networks  inc comparison of to revenues 
total revenues in increased to million from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in equipment sales 
total revenues for the period included million of equipment sales  compared to million in qwest accounted for million of equipment revenue in as compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to qwest s increased deployment in the first three quarters of cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues increased to million in from million in included in cost of sales was a million charge to inventory that was primarily related to a lower of cost or market adjustment to certain residential gateway products due to decreases in our sales price per unit and other obsolescence reserves 
our gross margin percentage  including the inventory charge  increased to in from in excluding the inventory charge  the gross margin percentage increased to in from in the increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily the result of higher unit volumes  leading to greater efficiencies  including lower fixed costs per unit 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development personnel 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the scale of our operations including additional personnel in our operations  administration  sales and marketing organizations  promotional expenses and other administrative expenses 
we generated higher sales expenses through the hiring of new sales representatives in our efforts to increase the number and size of our customer accounts 
non cash compensation charge 
substantially all of our employees had been granted contingently exercisable stock options that became options to purchase our common stock upon our recapitalization in in addition  tandem stock options were granted in january to some of our employees 
as a result  non cash compensation expense was recognized upon the completion of our initial public offering based on the difference between the exercise price of these options and the initial public offering price of our common stock 
the non cash compensation expense related to these option grants was million in and million in interest income expense  net 
interest income in was million  and represents interest income earned on proceeds from our initial public offering 
in  interest expense was million  and related to interest on a million note and accrued interest thereon payable to general instrument that general instrument contributed to us in exchange for shares of our common stock immediately prior to our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in in  the use of cash in operating activities was primarily due to our net losses of million  less non cash charges of approximately million  and an increase in inventory net purchases of million and a reduction in accounts payable of million  partially off set by a reduction in accounts receivable of million 
during  the cash used in operating activities was primarily due to net losses of million  and an increase in inventory and receivables of million and million  partially off set by an increase in liabilities of million 
in  net loss of million included million in non cash compensation charges 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in net cash used by investing activities was million in and million in the amount was primarily attributable to the sale of marketable securities  partially off set by capital expenditures made to support our engineering and testing activities as well as an additional million investment in virtual access 
in  we also received million for the sale of our software product line 
in  net cash used in investing activities also included investments in expanse networks  inc  outreach communications llc and virtual access totaling approximately million  off set by the sale of million in marketable securities 
net cash used in also included purchases of million of marketable securities with the proceeds from our initial public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in the amount is primarily related to borrowings of million from motorola  mortgage proceeds of million and million in proceeds related to our tax sharing agreement with motorola 
the amount was partially off set by the repayment of a million note 
the amount was primarily related to million in proceeds related to the tax sharing agreement with motorola and million related to the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities in included million net proceeds from our initial public offering  million contributed by general instrument acquired by motorola  inc in january and borrowings of million 
motorola loan commitment during we entered into a note agreement with motorola for million which matures on may  interest is payable monthly and is determined on either the base rate  as defined in the agreement  plus or the eurodollar rate plus at december  in connection with the note agreement we granted warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock   warrants have an exercise price of per share and  warrants have an exercise price of per share 
warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock were exercisable at december  the remaining warrants become exercisable as follows  shares become exercisable unless  prior to may   all borrowings under the note agreement have been repaid in full  and it has been terminated   shares become exercisable unless  prior to november  all borrowings under the note agreement have been repaid in full  and it has been terminated  and  shares become exercisable unless  prior to february   all borrowings under the note agreement have been repaid in full  and it has been terminated 
we do not expect to repay amounts due under the agreement until its maturity date of may  as a result  the debt discount related to the estimated fair value of the remaining  warrants will be adjusted in subsequent periods  up to their respective measurement dates  to reflect changes in our stock price 
the fair value of the warrants of million was recorded as a discount to the note payable with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions no dividends  risk free interest rate that ranged from to  volatility of  and a contractual life of five years 
as of december   no shares of common stock had been purchased under the warrants 
we are amortizing the discount under the effective interest method up to the maturity date may  of the related note 
during the year ended december  we amortized million of the discount  which has been reflected as interest expense in our statement of operations 
as of december   the motorola note was recorded at million  net of million of unamortized discount 
the note agreement with motorola contains various covenants  including compliance with net worth requirements  and restrictions on additional indebtedness  capital expenditures  and payment of dividends 
as of december   we were not in compliance with the net worth financial covenant 
on march   we and motorola amended the note agreement to waive the debt covenant violation and established revised financial covenants for net worth 
tax sharing and allocation agreement with motorola in december  we received a million advance from motorola related to a tax sharing and allocation agreement the tax sharing agreement 
during we received an additional million in january  and the tax sharing agreement was finalized in february the amount advanced to us of million was based on an estimate of the present value of income tax benefits to motorola from the inclusion of our operating losses for the period from january  to may  in motorola s consolidated tax return 
on october   we received a revised calculation of the estimated present value of income tax benefits to motorola based upon actual net losses that were included in motorola s tax return 
the revised amount was million 
under the original agreement  we were required to repay the million difference by october  on october   the loan agreement between us and motorola was amended to include such million see above 
to the extent motorola does not achieve the expected tax benefits by september   we must repay any difference 
in the event of a debt or equity security offering or a sale of assets in excess of million  the first million of proceeds may be retained by us  the next million between million and million of such proceeds will be allocated at least one third to repay our obligations under the tax sharing agreement  and the balance may be retained by us  the next million of such proceeds between million and million will be allocated at least one half to repay our obligations under the tax sharing agreement and the balance may be retained by us  amounts of such proceeds in excess of million must be used first to repay our obligations under the tax sharing agreement to the extent of such obligations and then to repay and reduce the amount owed under the note agreement 
mortgage financing on october   we received million under a mortgage loan for a company owned office building 
the loan is amortized over a year period with a ten year term and bears interest at an annual fixed rate of 
the entire unpaid principal balance  plus accrued interest thereon is due and payable on november  the mortgage was guaranteed by motorola 
in consideration for the guarantee  we issued to motorola warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
accordingly  the warrants were recorded at the fair value of million  with a discount to the mortgage loan note payable and a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions no dividends  risk free interest rate that ranged from to  volatility of  and a contractual life of five years 
vendor note payable at december   we had a million note payable to a vendor 
the note bears interest at per year 
accrued interest at december  was million 
on march   the vendor note payable was amended 
the revised principal and interest payment terms are as follows million on march   million on may  and the balance of million on march  such amended due dates have been considered in the table below 
contractual obligations the following table depicts our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period thereafter total in millions vendor note payable motorola debt note payable tax sharing liability mortgage debt off balance sheet commitments vendor purchase commitments operating leases total contractual obligations results and management s plans for in  net loss was million and net cash used in operating activities was million 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our ability to generate operating income and positive operating cash flows is dependent on our ability to increase sales  convert our inventory and accounts receivable to cash  negotiate favorable terms with our vendors  effectively manage our operating costs and to continue to raise sufficient operating capital 
since late  we have been significantly dependent on motorola for financial resources 
advances from motorola totaled million in and loans and advances totaled million in in addition  on february   we issued million of redeemable convertible preferred stock preferred stock to motorola comprised of  shares at a purchase price of per share 
each share of preferred stock is convertible  at the option of the holder  into two shares of our common stock  or  shares in total 
the preferred stock is redeemable  at the option of the holder  at an initial redemption price of per share  on or after february  dividends are cumulative at a rate of  payable in cash or additional shares of preferred stock  at our option 
liquidation value is per share 
in conjunction with this financing  we issued to motorola warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants have a term of five years 
during  in addition to the motorola financing described above  we instituted the following measures to improve liquidity closed our operation in vietnam eliminating employees in april   reduced our workforce by approximately employees in april   received million in october through the mortgage of our largest office building  sold our software product line in october and received million in net proceeds  reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or in october reduced our commitments to purchase raw materials from vendors from approximately million in the second quarter of to approximately million as of december   primarily due to inventory purchases  along with vendor negotiations  and extended payments terms for million of vendor payables see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  in addition to the issuance of million of preferred stock to motorola we reduced our workforce by approximately employees or in january  and on march   motorola agreed to make available to us an additional million in financing see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
management believes that the cash on hand and amounts available under the march  million financing with motorola will be sufficient to enable us to meet our financial obligations and sustain our operations through at least december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies and significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue we recognize revenue when contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  we recognize revenue from equipment sales upon shipment 
in cases where title and risk of loss pass upon delivery  we recognize revenue from equipment sales upon receipt by the customer 
we accrue a provision for estimated sales returns as a reduction of revenue at the time of revenue recognition 
inventory impairment and loss on purchase commitments during  we recorded a write down of inventory excess and obsolete quantities and lower of cost or market adjustments related to our current generation product platform and related communications equipment totaling million 
inventory related charges were calculated based upon i the substantial completion of the negotiation process with our contract manufacturers and their suppliers and our other vendors regarding purchase commitments and cancellations made by us  ii the inventory levels in excess of forecasted demand and iii our estimates of salvage or recovery value for each raw material or finished good on an item by item basis 
significant estimates included in the calculation of the inventory write downs above include forecasted demand for our products  sales prices for residential gateways and other finished goods and estimated salvage or recovery value for excess raw materials and finished goods 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and therefore additional inventory write downs may be necessary in future periods 
impairment of long term assets we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long term assets  and recognize an impairment loss when changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of that asset may not be recoverable 
when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
during  we recorded impairment losses of million 
included within our impairment losses are write downs of certain long term investments  acquired goodwill and certain other long term assets 
significant estimates included in the calculation of the impairment loss are estimates of the future operating cash flows and the ultimate sales price of the underlying assets  if any 
accrued warranty reserves we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenues are recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our contract manufacturers  our warranty obligation is affected by actual warranty costs including  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
employee stock based compensation we account for employee stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
if we were to account for this compensation under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 results would have changed as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
we adopted sfas as of january   as required 
upon the adoption of sfas  we will no longer amortize goodwill of million at december  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted sfas on january  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below 
we have incurred net losses and negative cash flow for our entire history  we expect to incur future losses and negative cash flow  and we have been financially dependent on motorola 
we incurred net losses of million in our ability to achieve positive operating cashflow and ultimate profitability will depend on the successful design  development  testing  introduction  marketing and broad commercial distribution of our broadband equipment products 
since late  we have been significantly dependent on motorola for financial resources 
loans from motorola totaled million in and million in we also issued million in redeemable convertible preferred stock to motorola in february  and entered into a million financing agreement with motorola in march  we expect to incur significant product development  sales and marketing  and administrative expenses 
in addition  we depend in part on cost reductions to improve gross profit margins because the fixed price nature of most of our long term customer agreements prevents us from increasing prices 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues and improve gross profit margins to achieve and maintain profitability 
we may not be successful in reducing our costs or in selling our products in sufficient volumes to realize cost benefits from our manufacturers 
we cannot be certain that we can achieve sufficient revenues or gross profit margin improvements to generate profitability 
our customer base of telephone companies is extremely concentrated and the loss of or reduction in business from even one of our customers  particularly qwest  could cause our sales to fall significantly 
a small number of customers have accounted for a large part of our revenues to date 
we expect this concentration to continue in the future 
if we lose one of our significant customers  our revenues could be significantly reduced 
qwest accounted for  and of total revenues in  and our agreements with our customers are cancelable by these customers on short notice  without penalty  do not obligate the customers to purchase any products and are not exclusive 
as a result of the merger between u s west and qwest  qwest slowed its purchases of our equipment while it re evaluates its plans regarding the deployment of vdsl across its network 
sales to qwest in the future are dependent upon their decision regarding the deployment of our product 
any continued significant reduction in purchases of our equipment by qwest could have a material adverse effect on us 
a significant market for our products may not develop if telephone companies do not successfully deploy broadband services such as high speed data and video  recent reluctance of telephone companies to make significant capital expenditures may heighten this issue 
telephone companies have recently begun offering high speed data services  and most telephone companies have not offered video services at all 
unless telephone companies make the strategic decision to enter the market for providing broadband services  a significant market for our products may not develop 
sales of our products largely depend on the increased use and widespread adoption of broadband services and the ability of our customers to market and sell broadband services  including video services  to their customers 
certain critical issues concerning use of broadband services are unresolved and will likely affect their use 
these issues include security  reliability  speed and volume  cost  government regulation and the ability to operate with existing and new equipment 
in addition  telephone companies have recently been reluctant to make significant capital expenditures 
even if telephone companies decide to deploy broadband services  this deployment may not be successful 
our customers have delayed deployments in the past and may delay deployments in the future 
factors that could cause telephone companies not to deploy  to delay deployment of  or to fail to deploy successfully the services for which our products are designed include the following industry consolidation  regulatory uncertainties and delays affecting telephone companies  varying quality of telephone companies network infrastructure and cost of infrastructure upgrades and maintenance  inexperience of telephone companies in obtaining access to video programming content from third party providers  inexperience of telephone companies in providing broadband services and the lack of sufficient technical expertise and personnel to install products and implement services effectively  uncertain subscriber demand for broadband services  and inability of telephone companies to predict return on their investment in broadband capable infrastructure and equipment 
unless our products are successfully deployed and marketed by telephone companies  we will not be able to achieve our business objectives and increase our revenues 
our limited operating history makes it difficult for you to evaluate our business and prospects 
we recorded our first sale in september as a result  we have only a limited operating history upon which you may evaluate our business and prospects 
you should consider our prospects in light of the heightened risks and unexpected expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development 
these risks  expenses and difficulties  which are described further below  apply particularly to us because the market for equipment for delivering voice  data and video services is new and rapidly evolving 
due to our limited operating history  it will be difficult for you to evaluate whether we will successfully address these risks 
we expect our quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate  and these fluctuations may make our stock price volatile 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues or operating results may cause volatility in the price of our stock 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which may cause the price of our stock to fall 
factors likely to cause variations in our quarterly revenues and operating results include delays or cancellations of any orders by qwest  which accounted for approximately of our revenues in  or by any other customer accounting for a significant portion of our revenues  variations in the timing  mix and size of orders and shipments of our products throughout a quarter or year  new product introductions by us or by our competitors  the timing of upgrades of telephone companies infrastructure  variations in capital spending budgets of telephone companies  and increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  product development or administration 
the amount and timing of our operating expenses generally will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the level of actual and anticipated business activity 
because most of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term  we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if our revenues are lower than we had projected and our results of operations could be harmed 
consolidation among telephone companies may reduce our sales 
consolidation in the telecommunications industry may cause delays in the purchase of our products and cause a reexamination of strategic and purchasing decisions by our customers 
in addition  we may lose relationships with key personnel within a customer s organization due to budget cuts  layoffs  or other disruptions following a consolidation 
for example  our sales to nynex  previously one of our largest clients  have decreased significantly as a result of a shift in focus resulting from its merger with bell atlantic 
in addition  as a result of the merger between u s west and qwest  qwest has slowed its purchases of our equipment while it re evaluates its plans regarding deployment of vdsl across its network 
because our sales cycle is lengthy and variable  the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict  and we may incur sales and marketing expenses with no guarantee of a future sale 
customers view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  customers typically undertake significant evaluation  testing and trial of our products before deployment 
this evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from nine months to more than a year 
before a customer places an order  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management efforts 
in addition  product purchases are frequently subject to unexpected administrative  processing and other delays on the part of our customers 
this is particularly true for customers for whom our products represent a very small percentage of their overall purchasing activities 
as a result  sales forecasted to be made to a specific customer for a particular quarter may not be realized in that quarter  and this could result in lower than expected revenues 
we incurred significant write downs of our inventory in the year ended december  based on estimates which may vary from actual results  therefore  additional inventory write downs may be necessary in future periods 
in the quarter ended june   we recorded an inventory write down including purchase commitments related to our current generation product platform and related communications equipment totaling million 
in the quarter ended december   we recorded an additional inventory write down of million 
to meet forecasted demand and reduce the anticipated component supply constraints that had existed in the past  we had increased inventory levels for certain components and had entered into purchase commitments for certain components with long lead times 
in the quarter ended june   our estimates of forecasted sales in and  for our current generation of products declined significantly 
as a result  the inventory charges were calculated based on the substantial completion of the negotiation process with our contract manufacturers and their suppliers and our other vendors regarding purchase commitments and cancellations made by us  the inventory levels in excess of forecasted demand through june   and our estimates of salvage or recovery value for each raw material of finished good on an item by item basis 
we do not currently anticipate that the excess inventory included in this provision will be used after june  based on our current demand forecast 
significant estimates included in the calculation of the inventory write downs include forecasted demand for our products  sales prices for residential gateways and other finished goods and estimated salvage or recovery value for excess raw materials and finished goods 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and therefore additional inventory write downs may be necessary in future periods 
government regulation of our customers and related uncertainty could cause our customers to delay the purchase of our products 
the telecommunications act requires telephone companies  such as the regional bell operating companies  to offer their competitors cost based access to some elements of their networks  including facilities and equipment used to provide high speed data and video services 
these telephone companies may not wish to make expenditures for infrastructure and equipment required to provide broadband services if they will be forced to allow competitors access to this infrastructure and equipment 
the federal communications commission announced that  except in limited circumstances  it will not require incumbent carriers to offer their competitors access to the facilities and equipment used to provide high speed data services 
nevertheless  other regulatory and judicial proceedings relating to telephone companies obligations to provide elements of their network to competitors are pending 
the fcc also requires incumbent carriers to permit competitive carriers to collocate their equipment with the local switching equipment of the incumbents 
the fcc s collocation rules recently have been vacated in part and continue to be subject to regulatory and judicial proceedings 
recently  the fcc issued a ruling that classified cable modem service as an interstate information service that is subject to fcc jurisdiction but not subject to common carrier regulation 
as a result  such services are not currently regulated by the fcc and should not be subject to separate state and local regulation 
this ruling may improve the competitive position of cable providers who compete with our customers who provide wireline based broadband services 
there is currently a pending rulemaking proceeding in which the fcc proposes to classify broadband internet access services provided by wireline based telephone companies as interstate information services 
we cannot predict when or how this rulemaking will be decided 
the uncertainties caused by these regulatory proceedings may cause these telephone companies to delay purchasing decisions at least until the proceedings and any related judicial appeals are completed 
the outcomes of these regulatory proceedings  as well as other fcc regulation  may cause these telephone companies not to deploy services for which our products are designed or to further delay deployment 
additionally  telephone companies deployment of broadband services may be slowed down or stopped because of the need for telephone companies to obtain permits from city  state or federal authorities to implement infrastructure 
our customers and potential customers will not purchase our products if they do not have the infrastructure necessary to use our products 
the copper wire infrastructures over which telephone companies may deliver voice  data and video services using our products vary in quality and reliability 
as a result  some of these telephone companies may not be able to deliver a full set of voice  data and video services to their customers  despite their intention to do so  and this could harm our sales 
even after installation of our products  we remain highly dependent on telephone companies to continue to maintain their infrastructure so that our products will operate at a consistently high performance level 
infrastructure upgrades and maintenance may be costly  and telephone companies may not have the necessary financial resources 
this may be particularly true for our smaller customers and potential customers such as independent telephone companies and domestic local telephone companies 
if our current and potential customers infrastructure is inadequate  we may not be able to generate anticipated revenues from them 
if competing technologies that offer alternative solutions to our products achieve widespread acceptance  the demand for our products may not develop 
technologies that compete with our products include other telecommunications related wireline technologies  cable based technologies  fixed wireless technologies and satellite technologies 
if these alternative technologies are chosen by our existing and potential customers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
in particular  cable operators are currently deploying products that will be capable of delivering voice  high speed data and video services over cable  including products from general instrument  our principal stockholder  and motorola  its parent 
our technology may not be able to compete effectively against these technologies on price  performance or reliability 
our customers or potential customers that also offer cable based services may choose to purchase cable based technologies 
cable service providers that offer not only data and video but also telephony over cable systems will give subscribers the alternative of purchasing all communications services from a single communications service provider  allowing the potential for more favorable pricing and a single point of contact for bill payment and customer service 
if these services are implemented successfully over cable connections  they will compete directly with the services offered by telephone companies using our products 
in addition  several telephone companies have commenced the marketing of video services over direct broadcast satellite while continuing to provide voice and data services over their existing copper wire infrastructure 
if any of these services are accepted by consumers  the demand for our products may not develop and our ability to generate revenues will be harmed 
we face intense competition in providing equipment for telecommunications networks from larger and more well established companies  and we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
these competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing new products than we are able to  which could result in the loss of current customers and impair our ability to attract potential customers 
our significant current competitors include advanced fibre communications  alcatel  cisco systems  efficient networks  ericsson  lucent technologies  nokia  nortel networks  reltec acquired by bae systems  cni division  formerly gec marconi  scientific atlanta  siemens and our largest stockholder  general instrument motorola  as well as emerging companies that are developing new technologies 
some of these competitors have existing relationships with our current and prospective customers 
in addition  we anticipate that other large companies  such as matsushita electric industrial which markets products under the panasonic brand name  microsoft  network computer  philips  sony  stmicroelectronics and toshiba america will likely introduce products that compete with our n residential gateway product in the future 
our customer base may be attracted by the name and resources of these large  well known companies and may prefer to purchase products from them instead of us 
consolidation of our competitors may cause us to lose customers and negatively affect our sales 
consolidation in the telecommunications equipment industry may strengthen our competitors positions in our market  cause us to lose customers and hurt our sales 
for example  as a result of the merger between u s west and qwest  qwest has slowed its purchases of our equipment while it re evaluates its plans regarding the deployment of vdsl across its network 
in addition  alcatel acquired dsc communications  lucent acquired ascend communications and bae systems  cni division  formerly gec marconi  acquired reltec 
acquisitions such as these may strengthen our competitors financial  technical and marketing resources and provide them access to regional bell operating companies and other potential customers 
consolidation may also allow some of our competitors to penetrate new markets that we have targeted  such as domestic local  independent and international telephone companies 
this consolidation may negatively affect our ability to increase revenues 
if we do not respond quickly to changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions by our competitors  our products may become obsolete 
our position in existing markets or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our growth and future financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with the increasing use of the internet  the growth in remote access by telecommuters  the increasingly diverse distribution sources for high quality digital video  and other industry and technological trends 
we expect that our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments 
we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
if we fail to timely and cost effectively develop new products that respond to new technologies and customer needs  the demand for our products may fall and we could lose revenues 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and the loss of their services could disrupt our operations and our customer relationships 
except for j 
michael norris  our president and chief executive officer  none of our executive officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement 
many of these employees have a significant number of options to purchase our common stock 
many of these options are currently vested and some of our key employees may leave us once they have exercised their options 
in addition  our engineering and product development teams are critical in developing our products and have developed important relationships with our regional bell operating company customers and their technical staffs 
the loss of any of these key personnel could harm our operations and customer relationships 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property may affect our ability to compete  and we could lose customers 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  and on trade secrets and confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
there is no guarantee that these safeguards will protect our intellectual property and other valuable confidential information 
if our methods of protecting our intellectual property in the united states or abroad are not adequate  our competitors may copy our technology or independently develop similar technologies and we could lose customers 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products  which could harm our business 
third party claims regarding intellectual property matters could cause us to stop selling our products  license additional technology or pay monetary damages 
from time to time  third parties  including our competitors and customers  have asserted patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us 
we expect that we will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our market grows and the functionality of products overlaps  and our products may currently infringe on one or more united states or international patents 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with third parties that could arise in the future  we could be required to pay substantial damages  including paying treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  to halt the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  and or to obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
licenses may not be available from any third party that asserts intellectual property claims against us  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
in addition  we indemnify our customers for patent infringement claims  and we may be required to obtain licenses on their behalf  which could subject us to significant additional costs 
we depend on third party manufacturers and any disruption in their manufacture of our products would harm our operating results 
we contract for the manufacture of all of our products and have limited in house manufacturing capabilities 
we rely primarily on two large contract manufacturers sanmina sci systems and flextronics enclosures 
the efficient operation of our business will depend  in large part  on our ability to have sanmina sci systems  flextronics enclosures and other companies manufacture our products in a timely manner  cost effectively and in sufficient volumes while maintaining consistent quality 
as our business grows  sanmina sci systems  flextronics enclosures and other contracted manufacturing companies may not have the capacity to keep up with the increased demand 
any manufacturing disruption could impair our ability to fulfill orders and could cause us to lose customers 
we have no long term contracts with our manufacturers  and we may not be able to deliver our products on time if any of these manufacturers stop making our products 
we have no long term contracts or arrangements with any of our contract manufacturers that guarantee product availability  the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in required volumes  we will have to identify acceptable alternative manufacturers  which could take in excess of three months 
it is possible that a source may not be available to us when needed or be in a position to satisfy our production requirements at acceptable prices and on a timely basis 
if we cannot find alternative sources for the manufacture of our products  we will not be able to meet existing demand 
as a result  we may lose existing customers  and our ability to gain new customers may be significantly constrained 
our inability to produce sufficient quantities of our products because of our dependence on components from key sole suppliers could result in delays in the delivery of our products and could harm our revenues 
some parts  components and equipment used in our products are obtained from sole sources of supply 
if our sole source suppliers or we fail to obtain components in sufficient quantities when required  delivery of our products could be delayed resulting in decreased revenues 
additional sole sourced components may be incorporated into our equipment in the future 
we do not have any long term supply contracts to ensure sources of supply 
in addition  our suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors  stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price  which could harm our operating results 
the occurrence of any defects  errors or failures in our products could result in delays in installation  product returns and other losses to us or to our customers or end users 
our products are complex and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures 
these problems have occurred in our products in the past and additional problems may occur in our products in the future and could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products 
in addition  we have limited experience with commercial deployment and we expect additional defects  errors and failures as our business expands from trials to commercial deployment at certain customers 
we will have limited experience with the problems that could arise with any new products that we introduce 
further  our customer agreements generally include a longer warranty for defects than our manufacturing agreements 
these defects could result in a loss of sales and additional costs and liabilities to us as well as damage to our reputation and the loss of our customers 
we do not have significant experience in international markets and may have unexpected costs and difficulties in developing international revenues 
we plan to extend the marketing and sales of our products internationally 
international operations are generally subject to inherent risks and challenges that could harm our operating results  including unexpected changes in telecommunications regulatory requirements  limited number of telephone companies operating internationally  expenses associated with developing and customizing our products for foreign countries  tariffs  quotas and other import restrictions on telecommunications equipment  longer sales cycles for our products  and compliance with international standards that differ from domestic standards 
to the extent that we generate international sales in the future  any negative effects on our international business could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
in particular  fluctuating exchange rates may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
motorola may exercise significant influence over our business and affairs and our stockholder votes and  for its own reasons  could prevent transactions which our other stockholders may view as favorable 
motorola beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of march  motorola will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters relating to our business and affairs  including approval of significant corporate transactions  which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us and could prevent you from receiving a premium for your shares 
we do not know whether motorola s plans for our business and affairs will be different than our existing plans and whether any changes that may be implemented under motorola s control will be beneficial or detrimental to our other stockholders 
our principal stockholder and its parent may have interests that conflict with the best interests of our other stockholders and us and may cause us to forgo opportunities or take actions that disproportionately benefit our principal stockholder 
it is possible that motorola could be in a position involving a conflict of interest with us 
in addition  individuals who are officers or directors of motorola and of us may have fiduciary duties to both companies 
for example  a conflict may arise if our principal stockholder were to engage in activities or pursue corporate opportunities that may overlap with our business 
these conflicts could harm our business and operating results 
our certificate of incorporation contains provisions intended to protect our principal stockholder and these individuals in these situations 
these provisions limit your legal remedies 
the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
the stock markets have in general  and with respect to high technology companies  including us  in particular  recently experienced extreme stock price and volume volatility  often unrelated to the financial performance of particular companies 
the price at which our common stock will trade in the future is likely to also be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in or our failure to meet securities analysts expectations  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors  limited public float of our common stock  conditions and trends in the telecommunications and other technology industries  and general economic and market conditions 
sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly 
as of march   motorola owned  shares of our common stock   shares of convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock  kevin kimberlin partners  lp and its affiliates owned  shares and warrants to acquire additional shares of our common stock  and fmr corporation owned  shares of our common stock 
if motorola  kevin kimberlin partners lp and its affiliates  fmr  or any of our other stockholders sells substantial amounts of common stock  including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants  in the public market  the market price of the common stock could fall 
in addition  any distribution of shares of our common stock by motorola to its stockholders could also have an adverse effect on the market price 
motorola and kevin kimberlin partners lp and its related persons and their transferees are entitled to registration rights pursuant to which they may require that we register their shares under the securities act 
in addition  as of march   there were outstanding options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
subject to vesting provisions and  in the case of our affiliates  volume and manner of sale restrictions  the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of our outstanding employee options will be eligible for sale into the public market at various times 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable 
several provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws and delaware law may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  restricting business combinations with interested stockholders  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings  and requiring super majority voting to effect amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by laws 
some of these provisions do not currently apply to motorola and its affiliates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate fluctuation 
interest on our debt to motorola is variable  payable monthly and is determined on either the base rate  as defined in the agreement  plus or the eurodollar rate plus at december  
if annual interest rates increased by change in interest rate  our interest expense on this debt would increase by approximately million 
we do not engage in any hedging activities  and we do not use derivatives or equity investments for cash investment purposes
