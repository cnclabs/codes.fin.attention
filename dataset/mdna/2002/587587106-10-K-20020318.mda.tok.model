overview the company was incorporated in connecticut in as tsi international software ltd 
and reincorporated in delaware in september we completed our initial public offering in july and a second public offering in june we changed our name to mercator software  inc effective april  our revenues are derived principally from three sources i license fees for the use of our software products  ii fees for consulting services and training  and iii fees for maintenance and technical support 
we generally recognize revenue from software license fees when a license agreement has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable  delivery of our products has occurred and no other significant obligations remain 
payments for licenses  services and maintenance received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
we intend to continue to increase the scope of service offerings insofar as it supports the licensing of our software products 
although it is not the case for  we believe that software licensing revenue will continue to account for a larger portion of total revenues than services and maintenance revenues 
revenues from services include fees for consulting services and training 
revenues from services are recognized on either a time and materials or percentage of completion basis as the services are performed and amounts due from customers are deemed collectible and nonrefundable 
revenues from fixed price service agreements are recognized on a percentage of completion basis in direct proportion to the services provided 
customers who license our products normally purchase maintenance contracts 
these contracts provide unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a fixed term  and can range from one to four years 
maintenance contracts are usually paid on an annual basis in advance  and revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
our products can be used by information technology professionals  as well as value added resellers  independent software vendors  software integrators or other third parties who resell  embed or otherwise bundle our products with their products 
license fee revenues are derived from direct licensing of software products through our direct sales force and strategic partners 
sales through strategic partners accounted for and of license revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
international revenues accounted for of total revenues for both the years ended december  and  respectively 
the size of orders typically range from  to over million per order 
the loss or delay of large individual orders  therefore  can have a significant impact on revenue and other quarterly results 
in addition  we generally recognize a substantial portion of our quarterly software licensing revenues in the last month of each quarter  and  as a result  revenue for any particular quarter may be difficult to predict in advance 
because operating expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in significant losses 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenue  operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of these and other factors  operating results for any quarter are subject to variation  and period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the policies discussed below are considered by us to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they require us to apply the most judgment and make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
with respect to the policies discussed below  we note that because of the uncertainties inherent in forecasting  the estimates frequently require adjustment 
our financial statements and related disclosures  which are prepared to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and accounts receivable and expenses during the period reported 
we are also required to disclose amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
our actual results in future periods could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
we consider the most significant accounting policies and estimates in our financial statements to be those surrounding revenues and accounts receivable  valuation of goodwill and long lived assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  legal contingencies  and restructuring reserves 
the accounting policies  the basis for any estimates and potential impact to our consolidated financial statements  should any of the estimates change  are further described as follows revenues and accounts receivable 
our revenues are derived principally from three sources i license fees for the use of our software products  ii fees for consulting services and training  and iii fees for maintenance and technical support 
we generally recognize revenue from software license fees when a license agreement has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable  delivery of our products has occurred and no other significant obligations remain 
for multiple element arrangements  we apply the residual method 
according to the residual method  revenue allocated to the undelivered elements is allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of those elements 
vsoe is determined by reference to the price the customer would be required to pay when the element is sold separately 
revenue applicable to the delivered elements is deemed equal to the remainder of the contract price 
the revenue recognition rules pertaining to software arrangements are complicated and certain assumptions are made in determining whether the fee is fixed and determinable and whether collectability is probable 
for instance  in our license arrangements with resellers  estimates are made regarding the reseller s ability and intent to pay the license fee 
our estimates may prove incorrect if  for instance  subsequent sales by the reseller do not materialize 
should our actual experience with respect to collections differ from our initial assessment  there could be adjustments to future results 
another assumption made in the revenue recognition process involves assessing whether the fee may be allocated to the various elements of the arrangement 
for instance  the literature on software revenue recognition requires that the vendor have the ability to determine whether vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element exists when recognizing revenue on the delivered elements 
the estimate of fair value of the undelivered element is generally determined by reference to separate stand alone sales of the undelivered element 
should our actual experience with respect to vsoe differ from our initial assessment  there could be adjustments to future results 
revenues from services include fees for consulting services and training 
revenues from services are recognized on either a time and materials or percentage of completion basis as the services are performed and amounts due from customers are deemed collectible and non refundable 
revenues from fixed price service agreements are recognized on a percentage of completion basis in direct proportion to the services provided 
to the extent the actual time to complete such services varies from the estimates made at any reporting date  our revenue and the related gross margins may be impacted in the following period 
in addition to assessing the probability of collection in conjunction with revenue arrangements  we continually assess the collectability of outstanding invoices 
assumptions are made regarding the customer s ability and intent to pay and are based on historical trends  general economic conditions  and current customer data 
should our actual experience with respect to collections differ from our initial assessment  there could be adjustments to bad debt expense 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an intangible or long lived asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  an estimate of the related asset s undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset will be made to measure whether the carrying value is recoverable 
any impairment is measured based upon the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value which is generally based on an estimate of future discounted cash flows 
at december   we had goodwill and long lived assets on our consolidated balance sheet net of accumulated amortization  totaling million 
should we experience reductions in revenues and cash flows because our business or market conditions vary from our current expectations  we may not be able to realize the carrying value of these assets and will record an impairment charge at that time 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that it is more likely than not  that we will be unable to utilize deferred income tax assets in the future 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million against million of gross deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax asset of million represents deductible temporary differences located in certain foreign jurisdictions  which is more likely than not to be utilized in the future 
we considered all of the available evidence to arrive at our position on the net deferred tax asset  however  should circumstances change and alter our judgment in this regard  it may have an impact on future operating results 
legal contingencies 
our policy is to accrue for an estimated loss from a legal contingency if both of the following conditions are met information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
when there is no best point estimate of the loss and only a range of loss is available  we accrue to the low end of the range 
we have certain significant legal and other contingencies as well as other litigation of a nature considered normal to our business which are pending against us 
as of december   we have accrued approximately million after considering any insurance recoveries for the aggregate amount of such contingencies 
should our actual payments resulting from the resolution of these contingencies differ from amounts accrued  we could incur additional expense in future periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring reserves 
as mentioned in note of our consolidated financial statements  we incurred restructuring charges totaling million during fiscal at december  the restructuring liabilities that remain totaled million on our consolidated balance sheets 
of this amount  million is related to employee termination benefits that we expect to be paid in early the remaining is for estimated future payments  primarily for rent in excess of anticipated sublease income 
certain assumptions went into this estimate including sublease income expected to be derived from these facilities 
should we negotiate more favorable subleases or reach a settlement with our landlords to be released from our existing obligations  we could realize a favorable benefit to our results of future operations 
should future lease costs  in excess of sublease income  if any  related to these facilities exceed our estimates  we could incur additional expense in future periods 
restatement of the quarter ended march  in august  the audit committee of our board of directors became aware of questions concerning the accounting for certain expense items 
the audit committee initiated a review of these items and performed certain additional procedures 
as a result of these procedures  it was determined that certain expenses were not properly recorded in the first and second quarters of and  accordingly  it was determined that the financial statements for the quarter ended march   should be restated the restatement 
the impact of this restatement on our results of operations for the three months ended march  was to increase cost of revenues by million  increase operating expenses by million  and increase the net loss by million from million to million 
mercator s fully diluted net loss per share increased by from to 
in addition to restating earnings for the quarter ended march   it was determined that the financial results announced on july  for the quarter ended june  were incorrect 
as a result  the financial results included in the june  form q are different from the results initially announced on july  during the third and fourth quarters of  we incurred certain expenses either connected with the restatement or to mitigate the effects of the restatement on our continuing operations 
these expenses were incremental to those expenses required to maintain normal levels of operations and we believe such expenses would not have been incurred had the restatement not occurred 
the incremental selling and marketing and general and administrative costs were approximately million and million  respectively  during the third and fourth quarters of the selling and marketing costs relate to a special commission incentive plan 
the general and administrative costs consisted primarily of severance costs for the former ceo and cfo  the cost of accelerating the vesting of options granted to our former ceo  legal costs associated with securities litigation  and search fees to replace departed executives 
incremental general and administrative costs relating to the restatement were approximately million during  representing legal costs associated with securities litigation and search fees to replace several executives

our revenues are derived principally from three sources i license fees for the use of our software products  ii fees for consulting services and training  and iii fees for maintenance and technical support 
total revenues decreased from million in to million in this decrease resulted from decreased license revenues partially offset by increased billings for services and maintenance 
software licensing 
total software licensing revenues decreased from million in to million in as a result of changes in sales force management  as well as continued weak economic conditions and delayed purchasing decisions by customers 
from to we noted a decrease in the number of license contracts exceeding  partially offset by a increase in the average size of such contracts 
americas software licensing revenues decreased from million to million  emea software licensing revenues decreased from million to million and apac software licensing revenues increased from million to million 
services 
total services revenues increased marginally from million in to million in americas services revenues increased from million to million  emea services revenue increased marginally from million to million and apac services revenue increased from million to million 
maintenance 
total maintenance revenues increased from million in to million in primarily due to growth in the worldwide customer base and the related renewals of annual maintenance contracts 
americas maintenance revenues increased from million to million  emea maintenance revenues increased from million to million and apac maintenance revenues increased from million to million 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues 
cost of software licensing revenues consists primarily of cd roms  manuals  distribution costs and the royalty costs of third party software that we resell 
cost of services consists primarily of personnel related and travel costs in providing consulting and training to customers 
cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of personnel related and occupancy costs in providing maintenance and technical support to customers 
the non cash stock option re pricing charge relates to the november re pricing of certain options previously granted to certain service and maintenance personnel as described below 
the amortization expense and impairment of intangibles charge relates to certain purchased intangible technology assets in connection with the braid acquisition in as described below 
total costs of revenues decreased from million in to million in primarily due to the write off of certain purchased technology assets in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by increases in the costs associated with higher services and maintenance revenues 
gross margin on software licensing revenues is higher than gross margins on services and maintenance revenues reflecting the low materials  packaging and other costs of software products compared with the relatively high personnel costs associated with providing consulting and training services  maintenance and technical support 
cost of services also varies based upon the mix of consulting and training services 
total gross margins increased from in to in primarily due to the absence of the fourth quarter write off of certain purchased technology assets offset by the increased composition of lower margin service and maintenance revenues within total revenues 
total gross margins  excluding the impact of the non cash stock option re pricing charge  amortization and impairment of intangibles  were million in compared to million in cost of software licensing 
total software licensing costs decreased from million in to million in due primarily to the write off of million in prepaid royalties in in connection with discontinuing use of the novera technology 
software licensing gross margin remained at in and cost of services exclusive of non cash stock option re pricing charges 
total services costs increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to an increase in services headcount and related personnel costs in the first half of  in anticipation of higher services revenues that failed to materialize 
consequently  total services gross margin decreased from in to in americas services costs increased from million in to million in  resulting in a decrease in services gross margin from in to in emea services costs increased from million in to million in resulting in a decrease in services gross margin from in to in apac services costs remained constant at million 
to reverse the decline in services gross margin  we initiated a restructuring plan in the second quarter of to reduce services headcount by positions in the americas and positions in emea and bring services personnel costs in line with services revenues 
this action contributed to services margins improving to for the fourth quarter of cost of maintenance exclusive of non cash stock option re pricing charges 
total maintenance costs increased from million in to million in to support the increase in the worldwide customer base 
total maintenance gross margin increased from in to in americas maintenance costs decreased from million in to million in resulting in an increase in maintenance gross margin from in to in emea maintenance costs increased from million in to million in resulting in a decrease in maintenance gross margin from in to in apac maintenance costs increased from million to million resulting in a decrease in maintenance gross margin from in to in stock option re pricing charge 
in november  our board of directors approved the exchange of  of options granted in september for an equal amount of options the replacement options priced at the then current market price of per share 
as this was a reduction in the exercise prices of fixed stock option awards  the replacement options are subject to variable accounting from the date of modification to the date on which the awards are exercised  forfeited  or expire unexercised in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation and fin accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
at december    re priced options were outstanding 
we recorded a variable non cash compensation charge of million during for the re priced options 
this charge is related to re priced options granted to personnel generating services and maintenance revenues 
we also recorded variable non cash compensation charges of million during for the re priced options related to operating personnel see below 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangible assets decreased from million in to million in the expense is related to the braid business combination completed in  which was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the decrease over prior year is a direct result of our decision  in the fourth quarter of as described below  to write off certain purchased technology assets that no longer supported our business focus 
we had net purchased technology intangibles of million and million at december  and  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  amortization relating to capitalized software costs has been charged to cost of revenues  and amortization relating to other intangible assets is being classified as a component of operating expenses 
intangibles impairment charge 
as discussed below  during the fourth quarter of  we re evaluated intangible assets related to recent acquisitions and determined that certain braid products no longer supported our focus on e business integration 
as a result of this decision we recorded a write off of million in the fourth quarter of to cost of revenues for those braid purchased technology intangibles 
operating expenses total operating expenses 
total operating expenses declined from million in to million in this decrease is primarily the result of a million intangible impairment charge recorded in and  to a lesser extent  expense rationalization and expense management actions initiated as part of restructuring activities 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in a non cash stock option re pricing charge  an million restructuring charge in  and increases in our general and administrative expenses  as discussed below 
product development exclusive of non cash stock option re pricing charges 
product development expenses include expenses associated with the development of new products and enhancements to existing products 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries  recruiting  and other personnel related costs  depreciation of development equipment  supplies  travel  allocated facilities and allocated communication costs 
product development expenses decreased from million in to million in primarily due to the closing of the burlington  ma research facility in december and the elimination of positions in the second quarter of we believe that a significant level of research and development expenditures is required to remain competitive 
accordingly  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development 
we expect that the dollar amount of research and development expenses will increase modestly in as we continue to enhance our core integration products and further develop industry solutions for our targeted vertical markets 
to date  all research and development expenditures have been expensed as incurred 
selling and marketing exclusive of non cash stock option re pricing charges 
selling and marketing expenses consist of sales and marketing personnel costs  including sales commissions  recruiting  travel  advertising  public relations  seminars  trade shows  product literature  and allocated facilities and communications costs 
selling and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in primarily due to staff reductions as a result of our shift in our sales strategy from increasing the number of sales personnel to strategically targeting certain vertical markets where our products have particular and proven value 
this decrease is partially offset by increases in our emea and apac selling and marketing expenses due to geographical market expansion activities 
americas selling and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in due to the elimination of personnel in the second and third quarters of  lower commissions of million due to lower license revenues  the absence in of million of retention incentives paid to sales people in the latter half of as a result of the restatement  reductions in marketing costs of million  and reductions in travel and telephone costs of million 
emea selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in apac selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in general and administrative exclusive of non cash stock option re pricing charges 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  recruiting  and other personnel related expenses for our administrative  executive  and finance personnel as well as outside legal  consulting  tax services and audit fees 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in primarily due to establishing litigation reserves of million in the americas as well as increased occupancy costs of million in emea 
we established new offices in sweden in and in spain and switzerland in total general and administrative expenses  excluding the reserves for litigation  have declined sequentially throughout as the restructuring announced in may took effect 
americas general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  excluding increases for litigation reserves of million 
emea general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in apac general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangible assets decreased from million in to million in as noted above  this expense is related to business combinations completed in and  which were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the decrease over prior year is a direct result of our decision  in the fourth quarter of  to write off certain of these assets that no longer supported our business focus 
intangibles impairment charge 
as discussed below  during the fourth quarter of we re evaluated intangible assets related to recent acquisitions and determined that the novera technology no longer supported our focus on e business integration 
as a result of this decision  the novera operation was closed in december of and we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in december to write off the remaining net book value of novera goodwill 
we had net operating intangible assets of million and million and net goodwill of million and million at december  and  respectively 
stock option re pricing charge 
as discussed above  we recorded a variable non cash compensation charge of million during and a million charge during related to the re pricing of certain fixed stock option awards previously granted to certain product development  sales and marketing and general and administrative employees in november of restructuring charge 
the restructuring charge of million for the year ending december  consists of million in severance related costs and million to accrue for losses related to leased space in wilton  ct  burlington  ma  boca raton  fl  bannockburn  il and cobham  uk no longer required due to reductions in our americas and emea personnel during the year 
the americas restructuring charge was million and the emea restructuring charge was million 
at december   million of the unpaid restructuring charge was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and million was included in other long term liabilities 
other income expense  net net other income expense represents interest income earned on cash and marketable securities balances and term license contracts  offset by borrowing costs related to certain contractual obligations 
net other income decreased from million in to net other expense of million in primarily due to the use of cash to fund operating losses for the first three quarters of  the related reduction of interest bearing investments up through our private placement that occurred in the fourth quarter of  and fees in connection with our credit facility with silicon valley bank 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes is based on the anticipated effective tax rates and taxable income for the full year taking into account each jurisdiction in which we operate 
during the second quarter of  we determined that taxable income for the full year of was unlikely to be sufficient to support the full value of the us federal and state deferred tax assets 
consequently  our tax provision includes a full valuation reserve for that asset 
the difference between our effective tax rate and the us statutory rate is primarily attributable to million of non deductible goodwill amortization and the effect of certain expected full year foreign taxable losses for the year ended december   and million of non deductible goodwill amortization and million of non deductible intangibles impairment charges for the year ended december  year ended december  compared with year ended december  during  we incurred a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million in our operating income loss excluding amortization  non cash stock option re pricing charges and intangibles impairment charge was million versus million in while gross profit  excluding amortization and an intangibles impairment charge  increased million as a result of increased revenues  we increased our spending in product development by million  selling and marketing by million and general and administrative expenses by million 
most of the increase in selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses were incurred in anticipation of higher revenue growth throughout the year 
these higher expenses contributed to our lack of profitability in the second half of the year  as we did not achieve our anticipated level of revenues 
additionally  in connection with the august restatement of first quarter results and the adjustment of previously released second quarter results  we incurred incremental expenses and related reorganization costs in the third and fourth quarters 
revenues total revenues 
total revenues increased from million in to million in this increase resulted from increased license revenues as well as increased billings for services and maintenance 
in addition  the braid acquisition and our german office contributed a full year of revenues in whereas in braid generated revenues only from march and germany generated revenues beginning in may 
software licensing 
total software licensing revenues increased from million in to million in primarily due to an increase in revenues from the mercator integration broker suite of products introduced in and  to a lesser extent  an approximate increase in license pricing which began to take effect in the fourth quarter of from to we noted a increase in the number of license contracts exceeding  and an increase in the average size of such contracts 
americas software licensing revenues increased from million in to million in emea software licensing revenues increased from million in to million in apac software licensing revenues increased from million in to million in the increases in emea in apac were primarily due to the successful introduction of the mercator integration broker suite to the braid customer base and a full year of revenue contributions in from the braid acquisition and the new sales office in germany 
services 
total services revenues increased from million in to million in primarily due to increased licensing of our products  which resulted in greater services and training opportunities 
americas services revenues increased from million in to million in emea services revenues increased from million in to million in apac services revenues increased from million in to million in maintenance 
total maintenance revenues increased from million in to million in primarily due to increased licensing of our products  including the mercator integration broker suite  the overall growth in the customer base using our products and  to lesser extent  an approximate increase in new maintenance pricing which began to take effect in the fourth quarter of americas maintenance revenues increased from million in to million in in line with the increase in software licensing revenues 
emea maintenance revenues increased from million in to million in in line with the increase in software licensing revenues 
apac maintenance revenues increased from million in to million in cost of revenues total cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues increased from million in to million in primarily due to the increase in revenue and the million write off of certain braid purchased technology intangibles in december of total gross margins decreased from in to in due to the intangible write off mentioned above and to a slightly higher mix of lower margin service and maintenance revenues within total revenues 
cost of software licensing 
total software licensing costs increased from million in to million in this increase was due to increased imbedded third party software royalty costs of million partially offset by reduced shipping costs as we expanded electronic transmission of our products over the web and delivery of software and documentation via cd rom 
the net increase in licensing costs is consistent with the corresponding increase in license revenues 
software licensing gross margin remained constant at in both and americas software licensing gross margin remained constant at in both and emea software licensing gross margin increased from in to in apac software licensing gross margin increased from in to in cost of services 
total services costs increased from million in to million in total services gross margin decreased from in to in americas services costs increased from million in to million in primarily due to a increase in personnel costs involved in delivering additional services to customers 
however  increased recruiting and training costs  as well as lower initial productivity related to new services personnel  and million of revenue reserves related to contract disputes caused americas services gross margin to decrease from in to in emea services costs increased from million in to million in in line with the increase in service revenues noted above 
emea services gross margin increased from in to in apac services costs increased from million in to million in apac services gross margin decreased from in to in as we added services personnel in advance of contractual services opportunities 
cost of maintenance 
total maintenance costs increased from million in to million in due primarily to an increase in the number of personnel hired to support the increased number of customer installations  as well as the mercator integration broker suite of products introduced in total maintenance gross margin increased from in to in americas maintenance costs increased from million in to million in to support the increase in revenues noted above while related gross margin increased from in to in emea maintenance costs increased from million in to million in to support the increase in revenues noted above 
emea maintenance gross margin increased marginally from in to in apac maintenance costs were million in both and apac maintenance gross margin increased from in to in amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense of the purchased technology intangibles mentioned above increased from million in to million in this was a result of a full year of amortization reflected in versus only months of amortization in intangibles impairment charge 
after the decline in our revenues in the third quarter of and management changes in the fourth quarter  it was necessary for us to evaluate our allocation of resources to products that were not generating significant revenue streams 
during the fourth quarter of  we re evaluated intangible assets related to recent acquisitions and determined that two products acquired in the braid acquisition  nimbus  a treasury management product  and freeway  an information management application  no longer supported our focus on e business integration 
revenues from nimbus amounted to  in and  in revenues from freeway amounted to  in and in while revenues from these products were not significant  we believed that having a suite of products addressing a multitude of needs gave us an edge over our competitors  and therefore we continued to offer these product lines during fiscal in the fourth quarter of  after re evaluating the opportunity for the braid nimbus and freeway products  we elected to discontinue support of these products 
as a result  the unamortized intangible asset net book value of million relating to these products was written off in the fourth quarter of and is included in cost of revenues intangibles impairment charge in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  we had net purchased technology intangibles of million and million at december  and  respectively 
operating expenses total operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased from million in to million in this increase is a result of a million goodwill impairment charge taken in  a million increase in intangibles amortization  a million increase in general and administrative expenses  a million increase in selling and marketing expenses and a million increase in product development expenses 
in addition  the braid and novera acquisitions in contributed a full year s worth of expenses in product development 
product development expenses increased from million in to million in primarily due to a million increase in personnel and sub contractor costs related to developing the mercator integration broker suite as well as an additional million in novera personnel costs 
product development expenses represented of total revenues in both and selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in primarily due to a increase in the number of sales personnel 
accordingly  personnel compensation costs increased by million  including million in enhanced incentives to motivate the sales force after the restatement of our first quarter results 
in addition  marketing costs increased million  travel and communication costs increased by million  recruiting costs increased by million and occupancy costs increased by million 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in americas selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in emea selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in primarily due to the braid acquisition in and successful efforts to introduce the mercator integration broker suite to braid s customer base in apac selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in general and administrative exclusive of non cash stock option re pricing charges 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in primarily due to a increase in the number of administrative personnel  which resulted in a million increase in personnel costs incurred to support our worldwide expansion  million increase in legal  accounting and consulting fees  and million increase in occupancy costs due to the acquisitions 
in addition  in the americas we incurred million in incremental turnover  legal  executive search  strategic consulting and accounting fees related to the restatement of our first quarter operating results and changes in senior management 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in americas general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in emea general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and apac general and administrative expenses increased significantly from million in to million in  both primarily due to the braid acquisition in march and expansion of activities in the european and asia pacific regions

amortization expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to a full months of goodwill and intangibles amortization in related to the braid and novera acquisitions  which occurred in march and september  respectively 
in addition  in april  we determined that operating targets related to contingent consideration included in the braid acquisition agreement had been achieved 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we issued stock and cash valued at million in additional consideration  this consideration was added to goodwill and goodwill amortization for the year was increased accordingly 
intangibles impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated intangible assets related to recent acquisitions and determined that the acquired operations from novera no longer supported our focus on e business integration 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the web broker product  which included the novera technology  would be discontinued 
in december  customers were contacted and informed they would be migrated to the web integrator product  which had similar functionality to web broker  but did not incorporate the novera technology 
in addition  we consolidated the research and development function from novera with our boca raton  florida facility in december and all novera research and development personnel left the company 
as a result of these decisions  we recorded an intangibles impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of to write off the remaining book value of the novera goodwill 
we had net operating intangible assets of million and million and net goodwill of million and million at december  and  respectively 
stock option re pricing charge 
we recorded a variable non cash compensation charge of million during related to the re pricing of certain fixed stock option awards previously granted to certain general and administrative employees in november of other income expense  net other income expense  net represents interest income earned on our cash and marketable securities balances and term license contracts offset by borrowing costs related to certain contractual obligations 
interest income decreased from million in to million in primarily due to lower average cash and marketable securities balances relating to the acquisitions of braid and novera  partially offset by higher average rates of return on these investments 
borrowing expenses increased from in to million in primarily due to interest on the braid contingent consideration obligation  commitment fees related to the fleet bank credit line agreement  and letter of credit fees 
income taxes at december   we established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits because of uncertainty that all of these assets could be utilized in the near term 
this valuation allowance  partially offset by benefits in foreign tax jurisdictions  resulted in a net tax provision of million in as compared to a million net tax benefit in our effective tax rate for both and is impacted by the fact that the majority of intangibles amortization is not deductible for income tax purposes  the intangibles impairment charge incurred in is also not deductible for income tax purposes 
in addition  the change in the valuation allowance noted above substantially reduced the effective tax rate benefit for liquidity and capital resources our cash position has improved in primarily as a result of proceeds realized from the sale of common stock through two private placements and from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  which resulted in net proceeds of million  partially offset by cash used in operations of million 
operating activities operating activities consumed cash of million during the year ended december  compared to providing cash of million during the year ended december  during the first half of  our operations consumed million of cash 
in the second half of  we eliminated our operating cash burn and generated million of cash from operations through i a increase in revenues over the first half of  ii restructuring activities which began in the second quarter of that included an approximate reduction in the consolidated workforce and a reorganization of our sales efforts  iii expense management efforts  and iv continued improvements in accounts receivable collections resulting in a decrease in the number of days sales outstanding in net accounts receivable from days at june  to days at december  net accounts receivable decreased from million at december  to million at december  due primarily to a million decline in fourth quarter revenues in as compared to  as well as improved collections  partially offset by a million increase in deferred revenue 
the number of days sales in net accounts receivable decreased from days at december  to days at december  as we applied new management resources to collection efforts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts increased modestly from million at december  to million at december  net accounts receivable increased modestly from million at december  to million at december  despite a increase in fourth quarter revenues and a million net increase in deferred revenue during this stability was accomplished primarily by a change in standard payment terms  improved collection procedures and a million net increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
standard payment terms changed from net days to due upon receipt 
improvements in collection procedures included hiring additional collection personnel  and earlier and more frequent contact with customers 
the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts was caused primarily by a million addition for receivables related to the carpet co op floorlink litigation see item 
this amount was charged against deferred revenue as the revenue for these billings had yet to be recognized due to uncertainties regarding their collectability 
in addition  charges to bad debt expense increased the allowance by million primarily in the second half of the year as economic conditions declined and the financial position of some customers deteriorated 
this increase was partially offset by million in accounts receivable written off against the allowance 
the number of days sales in net accounts receivable decreased from days at december  to days at december  current liabilities increased from million at december  to million at december  accounts payable increased from million to million primarily due to higher legal fees in the americas 
accrued expenses increased from million to million due primarily to the establishment of million in settlement reserves associated with legal contingencies in the americas  the current portion of the restructuring reserve of million and a million increase in accrued income taxes  partially offset by a million decrease in accrued commission expense related to the year to year decline in fourth quarter revenues  as well as payments of million for legal and consulting expenses and leasehold improvements accrued at december  current portion of deferred revenue increased from million to million due primarily to a million increase in deferred maintenance revenue related to the increased number of customers with installed software and a million increase in deferred license revenue related to contracts with acceptance testing 
current liabilities increased from million at december  to million at december  accounts payable increased from million to million primarily due to higher legal and consulting fees in the americas 
accrued expenses increased from million to million due primarily to a million increase in accrued employee compensation  million in accrued legal and consulting expenses and million in accrued leasehold improvements 
current portion of deferred revenue increased from million to million due primarily to a million increase in deferred maintenance revenue related to the increased number of customers with installed software along with higher maintenance pricing  partially offset by a million decrease in deferred license revenue 
the decrease in deferred license revenue was caused by a million charge related to the collectability of certain carpet co op floorlink receivables with the balance attributed to the recognition of revenue in accordance with certain term license contracts 
our short term operating commitments include operating lease payments over the next twelve months of approximately million  including million for our new office space in wilton  ct 
should we negotiate an early termination of this lease  our quarterly cash flows may be impacted 
in addition  we believe that our expenditures for product development efforts in will increase modestly as we continue to enhance our integration products and further develop industry solutions for our targeted vertical markets 
as of december   we have accruals of million  after considering insurance recoveries  related to settlements associated with outstanding legal contingencies 
a significant increase in the estimate of the cost of settlement of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
excluding the impact of potential cash payments for the contingencies discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe that we will generate modest positive cash flows from operations on a full year basis  however  cash flows generated from operations in any one quarter could be negative 
we believe current cash on hand as well as cash available from our silicon valley bank facility see further discussions below will be sufficient to meet our needs associated with cash shortfalls in any one quarter 
investing activities investing activities consumed cash of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  investing activities for included a million net investment in furniture  fixtures and equipment and a million increase in the restricted collateral deposit in connection with a facility lease  partially offset by a million liquidation of investments in marketable securities 
investing activities in included a million net investment in furniture  fixtures and equipment  a million increase in intangible assets in connection with the braid acquisition earn out agreement and a million restricted collateral deposit in connection with a facility lease  partially offset by a million liquidation of investments in marketable securities 
during  investing activities included a sale of marketable securities of million  which was offset by cash outlays of million in connection with the braid and novera acquisitions and a million net investment in furniture  fixtures and equipment 
our expenditures for furniture  fixtures and equipment are expected to be approximately million in in addition  capital lease commitments over the next twelve months are approximately million 
financing activities financing activities generated cash of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  financing activities for included net proceeds of million from the private sale of shares of common stock to a group of institutional investors  net proceeds of million from the sale of shares of restricted common stock to mitsui and co  ltd  million of proceeds from employee stock plan purchases and million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset by million of capital lease principal payments 
financing activities for included million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and million of proceeds from employee stock plan purchases  partially offset by million of capital lease principal payments 
during  financing activities generated million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and million of proceeds from employee stock plan purchases  partially offset by million for the repayment of long term debt 
in february  we entered into a three year agreement with fleet bank for a million line of credit for general corporate purposes  including working capital  leasehold improvements and equipment and certain acquisition purposes 
as a result of operating losses sustained during the quarter ended september   we were in violation of certain financial covenants in the agreement 
in november  fleet bank notified us that it would only make advances under the agreement on a discretionary basis 
in march  the million line of credit agreement with fleet bank was terminated 
since inception no amounts were borrowed under the agreement 
in june  we drew a million letter of credit with fleet bank in connection with a new headquarters office lease 
at fleet bank s request we provided a million restricted collateral deposit as security for the outstanding letter of credit 
in january  we increased the letter of credit to million and the related restricted collateral deposit to million 
the letter of credit agreement with fleet bank remains in effect 
in june  we finalized a credit facility with silicon valley bank 
this facility is secured by certain receivables and the amount available under the facility at december  is million as a result of our achieving positive ebitda in the fourth quarter of this amount may be decreased to million if we do not maintain positive ebitda during each quarter of fiscal in september and november  silicon valley bank agreed to waive and modified certain terms of the credit facility  including eliminating the requirement for a capitalization event and relaxing the level of the adjusted quick ratio covenant 
the bank also extended the expiration date of the facility to november  specifically  the agreement  as amended  requires us to maintain an adjusted quick ratio  as defined  of at least to for each month subsequent to december  we were in compliance with the adjusted quick ratio covenant under the agreement  as amended  at december  if the company were in default  such default  if uncured  could result in our being required to pay a million termination fee 
prior to november   we expect to seek to renegotiate the facility to extend it beyond its scheduled termination or  alternatively  negotiate a similar facility with another party on no less favorable terms 
since inception  no amounts have been borrowed under this facility 
cash flow and funding requirements we believe that current cash and cash equivalent balances million at december   combined with net cash expected to be generated from operations  are sufficient to meet anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures million through december  however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to uncertainty 
additionally  a significant increase in the cost of settlement of legal contingencies in excess of amounts accrued and insurance coverages could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
our long term capital needs will depend on numerous factors  including the rate at which we are able to obtain new business from clients and expand our personnel and infrastructure to accommodate such growth  as well as the rate at which we choose to invest in new technologies 
see factors that may affect future results below 
if current cash  cash equivalents and cash that may be generated from operations are deemed to be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we will likely seek to sell additional equity securities 
moreover  we may determine to sell additional equity for the purpose of further enhancing our cash resources 
the sale of additional equity or equity related securities  if achieved  would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  we will  from time to time  consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses  products  services and technologies  which might impact our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue debt or additional equity securities 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
a failure to obtain such financing may adversely impact our business 
in addition  if our cash flows were to substantially decrease  our goodwill or our purchased technology intangible assets may become impaired and we would have to record a charge for impairment  which may be material to our financial position and results of operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and subsequently  sfas no 
after its adoption 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july   and sfas no 
is effective january  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june   but before sfas no 
is adopted in full  are not amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  continued to be amortized and tested for impairment prior to the full adoption of sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we are required to evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new classification criteria in sfas no 
for recognition separate from goodwill 
we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
if an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period 
impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement requires us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we will then have up to six months from january  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
the second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption of sfas no 
 we will have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
 it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this statement on our financial statements at the date of this report  including whether we will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
under such circumstances we would record a corresponding asset  which is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january  we have not yet determined the expected impact of sfas no 
on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january  we have not yet determined the expected impact of sfas no 
on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf concluded that reimbursements for out of pocket expenses incurred should be included in revenue in the income statement and subsequently issued eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred in january the company is required to adopt eitf on january  and will reclassify comparative financial statements for prior periods to comply with the guidance in this eitf 
management has not yet determined the impact of eitf on the company s revenues and cost of revenues for the years ended december  and other pronouncements issued by the fasb or other authoritative accounting standard groups with future effective dates are either not applicable or are not significant to our financial statements 
conversion to a single european currency we generate revenues in a number of foreign countries 
however  as the majority of foreign contracts are denominated in us dollars  we do not expect the conversion to a single european currency to have a material impact on our financial results 
factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the following risks factors before making an investment decision 
our business  results of operations  and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of the following factors 
the market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and difficult to predict and may cause our stock price to fluctuate our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
we had operating losses in and may continue to have losses in the future 
in certain quarters of  our operating results were below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and were followed by a decline in the price of our stock 
this may occur in the future and if our revenues and operating results do not meet expectations  our stock price could decline which may result in potential customers choosing other vendors 
in  we announced a restructuring plan to reduce our cost structure 
this plan consisted of work force reductions of across the company  closing some office facilities and reducing some other space 
we also announced a strategic plan to focus our resources on the largest vertical market opportunities where we have significant experience including financial services  manufacturing  retail and distribution  and healthcare 
our restructuring plan that has been put in place remains somewhat unproven  and could result in increased volatility in and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
our focus on large vertical market opportunities may result in longer sales cycles and any delay in obtaining larger contracts may have an adverse impact on quarterly operating results 
we believe that investors should not rely on period to period comparisons of our results of operations  as they are not necessarily indications of our future performance 
an adverse reaction by customers and vendors to changes in our company may result in a revenue decline and adverse impact to cash position our success depends in large part on the support of key customers and vendors who may react adversely to changes in our company 
many members of our senior management have joined us during the past year 
it will take time and resources for these individuals to effect change within our organization and during this period our vendors and customers may re examine their willingness to do business with us 
if we are unable to retain and attract our existing and new customers and vendors  our revenues could decline and our cash position could be materially adversely affected 
our future success depends on retaining our key personnel and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified employees other than roy king  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  all of our employees are employed at will and we have no fixed term employment agreements with our employees 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees could harm our business 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract  train and retain highly qualified sales  research and development  professional services and managerial personnel  particularly sales and professional services personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense 
we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel 
we have at times experienced  and we continue to experience  difficulty in recruiting qualified sales and research and development personnel  and we anticipate these difficulties may continue in the future 
furthermore  we have in the past experienced  and in the future expect to continue to experience  a significant time lag between the date sales  research and development and professional services personnel are hired and the date these employees become fully productive 
it would be difficult for us to materially or immediately adjust our spending if we experience any revenue shortfalls our future revenues will be difficult to predict and we could fail to achieve our revenue expectations 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectation of future revenues  and expense levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may be unable to materially adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if revenue levels are below expectations for any reason  our operating results and cash flows are likely to be harmed 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenue because large portions of our expenses are related to headcount that may not be easily reduced without harming our business 
if cash flows are negatively impacted  there can be no assurance that our existing accounts receivable financing arrangement will be sufficient to meet cash needs or will be available in the future  as there is no assurance that we will be able to draw down upon our existing line of credit 
we may experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues or results of operations it is not uncommon for software companies to experience strong calendar year ends followed by weaker subsequent quarters  in some cases with sequential declines in revenues or operating profit 
we believe that many software companies exhibit this pattern in their sales cycles primarily due to customers buying patterns and budget cycles 
we have displayed this pattern in the past and may display this pattern in future years 
we have been and may continue to be impacted by the overall economy and the events of september th as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions including the impact of the events of september th on certain of our vertical markets  we have seen reduced capital spending  and software licensing revenues have declined in fiscal year in total and as a percentage of our total revenues as compared to the prior year 
in particular  sales to e commerce and internet businesses  value added resellers and independent software vendors were impacted during sales to financial institutions have been impacted in the fourth fiscal quarter of if the economic conditions in the united states worsen  or if a wider global economic slowdown occurs  we may experience a material adverse impact on our revenues and collections of our accounts receivable 
we depend on the sales of our existing mercator products and related services we first introduced our mercator products in in recent years  a significant portion of our revenue has been attributable to licenses of mercator products and related services  and we expect that revenue attributable to our mercator products and related services will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our future operating results significantly depend on the market acceptance and growth of our existing mercator product line and enhancements of these products and services 
market acceptance of our mercator product line may not increase or remain at current levels  and we may not be able to market successfully our mercator product line or develop extensions and enhancements to this product line on a long term basis 
in the event that our current or future competitors release new products that provide  or are perceived as providing  more advanced features  greater functionality  better performance  better compatibility with other systems or lower prices than our mercator product line  demand for our products and services would likely decline 
a decline in demand for  or market acceptance of  the mercator product line would harm our business 
we may face significant risks in expanding our international operations international revenues accounted for approximately of our total revenues for compared to approximately of our total revenues for and of our total revenues for continued expansion of our international sales and marketing efforts will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we also expect to commit additional time and development resources to customizing our products for selected international markets and to developing international sales and support channels 
international operations involve a number of additional risks  including the following o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  o impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  o longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o dependence on independent resellers  o reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  o the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  o potentially adverse tax consequences  and o political instability 
to the extent that our international operations expand  we expect that an increasing portion of our international license and service and other revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as we continue to expand our international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
we may choose to limit our exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or similar hedging strategies 
the currency exchange strategy that we adopt may not be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
in addition  the above listed factors may cause a decline in our future international revenue and  consequently  may harm our business 
we may not be able to sustain or increase revenue that we derive from international sources 
we may experience difficulties in developing and introducing new or enhanced products necessitated by technological changes our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to anticipate changes  to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological advancements and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
development of enhancements to existing products and new products depend  in part  on a number of factors  including the following o the timing of releases of new versions of applications systems by vendors  o the introduction of new applications  systems or computing platforms  o the timing of changes in platforms  o the release of new standards or changes to existing standards  o changing customer requirements  and o the availability of cash to fund development 
our product enhancements or new products may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
we have in the past experienced delays in the introduction of product enhancements and new products and we may experience delays in the future 
furthermore  as the number of applications  systems and platforms supported by our products increases  we could experience difficulties in developing  on a timely basis  product enhancements which address the increased number of new versions of applications  systems or platforms served by our existing products 
if we fail  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce product enhancements or new products in a timely and cost effective manner or if we experience any significant delays in product development or introduction  our customers may delay or decide against purchases of our products as our products may be rendered obsolete 
the success of our products will also depend upon the success of the platforms we target we may  in the future  seek to develop and market enhancements to existing products or new products  which are targeted for applications  systems or platforms that we believe will achieve commercial acceptance 
this could require us to devote significant development  sales and marketing personnel  as well as other resources  to these efforts  which would otherwise be available for other purposes 
we may not be able to successfully identify these applications  systems or platforms  and even if we do so  we may not achieve commercial acceptance or we may not realize a sufficient return on our investment 
failure of these targeted applications  systems or platforms to achieve commercial acceptance or our failure to achieve a sufficient return on our investment could harm our business 
we may not successfully expand our sales and distribution channels an integral part of our strategy is to expand our indirect sales channels  including strategic partners  value added resellers  independent software vendors  systems integrators and distributors 
however  while we believe this is a profitable and incremental strategy  such sales will be at lower unit prices  may limit our contact with customers potentially inhibiting future follow up sales and places us in a position of depending upon the reseller to achieve customer satisfaction  and could result in these resellers selling to customers we may have sold to 
we are increasing resources dedicated to developing and expanding these indirect distribution channels 
in  of our total license revenues came from those sources 
we may not be successful in expanding the number of indirect distribution channels for our products 
if we are successful in increasing our sales through indirect sales channels  we expect that those sales will be at lower per unit prices than sales through direct channels  and revenue we receive for each sale will be less than if we had licensed the same product to the customer directly 
as a result  our ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered 
even if we successfully expand our indirect distribution channels  any new strategic partners  value added resellers  independent software vendors  system integrators or distributors may offer competing products  or have no minimum purchase requirements of our products 
these third parties may also not have the technical expertise required to market and support our products successfully 
if the third parties do not provide adequate levels of services and technical support  our customers could become dissatisfied  and we may have to devote additional resources for customer support 
our brand name and reputation could be harmed 
selling products through indirect sales channels could cause conflicts with the selling efforts of our direct sales force 
our strategy of marketing products directly to end users and indirectly through value added resellers  independent software vendors  systems integrators and distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts 
our direct sales efforts may compete with those of our indirect channels and  to the extent different resellers target the same customers  resellers may also come into conflict with each other 
although we have attempted to manage our distribution channels to avoid potential conflicts  channel conflicts may harm our relationships with existing value added resellers  independent software vendors  systems integrators or distributors or impair our ability to attract new value added resellers  independent software vendors  systems integrators and distributors 
we may encounter difficulties in managing our long term growth the long term growth of our business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a strain on our administrative  financial  sales and operational resources and increased demands on our internal systems and controls 
to address this growth  we have recently implemented  or are in the process of implementing and will implement in the future  a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
we may not be able to complete successfully the implementation and integration of these systems  procedures and controls  or hire additional personnel  in a timely manner 
our inability to manage our growth amid changing business conditions  or to adapt our operational  management and financial control systems to accommodate our growth  could harm our business 
we face significant competition in the market for e business integration software the markets for our products and services are extremely competitive and subject to rapid change 
because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the software market  we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies 
in the e business integration market  our products and related services compete primarily against solutions developed internally by individual businesses to meet their specific e business integration needs 
in addition  we face increasing competition in the e business integration market from other third party software vendors 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  product development and marketing resources  greater name recognition and larger customer bases than we do 
our present or future competitors may be able to develop products that are comparable or superior to those we offer  adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies  evolving industry trends or customer requirements  or devote greater resources than we do to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
accordingly  we may not be able to compete effectively in our target markets against these competitors 
we expect that we will face increasing pricing pressures from our current competitors and new market entrants 
our competitors may engage in pricing practices that may reduce the average selling prices of our products and related services 
to offset declining average selling prices  we believe that we must successfully introduce and sell enhancements to existing products and new products on a timely basis 
we must also develop enhancements to existing products and new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices 
to the extent that enhancements to existing products and new products are not developed in a timely manner  do not achieve customer acceptance or do not generate higher average selling prices  our operating margins may decline 
government regulation and legal uncertainties relating to the internet could adversely affect our business congress has passed legislation and several more bills have been sponsored in both the house and senate that are designed to regulate various aspects of the internet  including  for example  on line content  copyright infringement  user privacy  and taxation 
in addition  federal  state  local and foreign governmental organizations are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate aspects of the internet  including libel  pricing  quality of products and services  and intellectual property ownership 
the laws governing the use of the internet  in general  remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws apply to the internet 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for on line commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  which may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online by limiting the type and flow of information over the internet 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect our business 
it is not known how courts will interpret both existing and new laws 
therefore  we are uncertain as to how new laws or the application of existing laws will affect our business or our clients business  which may have an indirect effect on our business 
increased regulation of the internet may decrease the growth in the use of the internet  which could decrease the demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  or results of operations and financial condition 
the united states omnibus appropriations act of places a moratorium on taxes levied on internet access from october to november however  states may place taxes on internet access if taxes had already been generally imposed and actually enforced prior to october states which can show they enforced internet access taxes prior to october and states after november may be able to levy taxes on internet access resulting in increased cost to access the internet which may result in a material adverse effect to our business 
we have only limited protection for our proprietary technology our success is dependent upon our proprietary software technology 
we protect our technology as described herein but this may not prevent misappropriation or development by third parties of similar products 
we do not have any patents and we rely principally on trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our technology 
we enter into confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees  distributors and customers  and we limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information by employees  distributors and customers 
the steps taken by us may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology  and such protections do not preclude competitors from developing products with functionality or features similar to our products 
furthermore  it is possible that third parties will independently develop competing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries  which could pose additional risks of infringement as we continue to expand internationally 
our failure or inability to protect our proprietary technology could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although we do not believe that our products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  infringement claims could be asserted against us or our customers in the future 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights  or for purposes of establishing the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation  either as plaintiff or defendant  would cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources from productive tasks whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
parties making claims against us or customers for which we are subject to payment of indemnification could recover substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block our ability to license our products in the united states or abroad 
such a judgment could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if it appears necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses to intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing 
licenses may not be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we believe that software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
any such claims  with or without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend and could adversely affect our business 
we are not aware of any currently pending claims that our products  trademarks or other proprietary rights infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
we may become subject to product liability claims our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements  especially unsigned shrink wrap licenses  may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
consequently  the sale and support of our software entails the risk of product liability claims in the future 
the ultimate outcome of pending securities litigation is uncertain after the restatement of our first quarter earnings and the adjustment to previously disclosed second quarter results  we were named in a series of similar purported securities class action lawsuits 
these lawsuits have now been consolidated into one matter 
the amended complaint in the consolidated matter alleges violations of united states securities law through alleged material misrepresentations and omissions and seeks an unspecified award of damages 
we believe that the allegations in the amended complaint are without merit  and we intend to contest them vigorously 
there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate outcome of this pending litigation or whether the ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of our operations 
our insurance company has reserved its rights with respect to this matter 
our stock price has fluctuated and could continue to fluctuate the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may be significantly affected by a number of factors  including the following o actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  o announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  o developments with respect to patents  copyrights or proprietary rights  o conditions and trends in the software or other industries  and o general market conditions 
in addition  the stock market has  from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the stock of technology companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the high and low sale prices of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market system in the past three years are included in item our stockholder rights plan  corporate governance structure and governing law may delay or prevent our acquisition by another company our corporate governing documents as well as delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to attempt to acquire or gain control of our company 
these provisions include o our board of directors can issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or action by the stockholders and this stock could have rights superior to those of existing stockholders and could impede the success of any acquisition attempt by another company  o we adopted a stockholders rights plan which permits existing stockholders to purchase a substantial number of shares at a substantial discount to the market price if a third party attempts to gain control on a large equity position in our company  o a stockholder must give our board of directors prior notice of a proposal to take action by written consent  o a stockholder must give advance notice to the board of directors before stockholder sponsored proposals may receive consideration at annual meetings and before a stockholder may make nominations for the election of directors  o vacancies on the board of directors may be filled until the next annual meeting of stockholders only by majority vote of the directors then in office  and o stockholders cannot call special meetings of stockholders 
we are also governed by section of the delaware general corporation law  which restricts certain business combinations with any interested stockholder  as defined by that statute 
our stockholder rights plan  our charter  bylaws and the provisions of section could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our outstanding voting stock and could delay or prevent a change in our control 
in addition  we have arrangements with certain officers and other option holders which provide for benefits upon a change in control  which could also delay or impede an acquisition 
future sales of our common stock by our stockholders could cause our stock price to decline as of march   we have outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock and also options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock granted under our directors and employee benefit plans 
the number of shares issuable upon exercise of warrants are subject to adjustment pursuant to anti dilution provisions 
holders of such warrants and options are likely to exercise them when  in all likelihood  we could obtain additional capital on terms more favorable than those provided in such warrants and options 
further  while these warrants and options are outstanding  our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms could be affected 
exercise of warrants and options may result in dilution to existing stockholders 
sales of a significant amount of common stock in the public market by existing shareholders  including holders of warrants and options  could adversely affect the market price of the common stock  and it may make it more difficult for us to sell our common stock in the future at times and for prices that we deem appropriate 
several of our stock and warrant holders are parties to registration rights agreements with us under which we are required to register their stock for sale to the public 
in january  we filed a registration statement covering resale of an aggregate of  shares 
sale of the shares of common stock covered by this registration statement  or even the availability of such shares for sale  may have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock from time to time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of operations  our financial position and cash flows are subject to a variety of risks  which include market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and movement in interest rates 
we do not  in the normal course of business  use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
uncertainties that are either non financial or non quantifiable  such as political  economic  tax  other regulatory or credit risks are not included in the following assessment of our market risks 
foreign currency exchange rates operations outside of the us expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes and could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
during the year ended december   of our total revenue was generated from our international operations  and the net assets of our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately of consolidated net assets as of december  our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business 
we operate outside the us primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france  germany  netherlands  sweden  switzerland  spain  singapore  hong kong  australia and japan 
these foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency  as certain sales are generated and expenses are incurred in such currencies 
foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our operations as compared to the us dollar 
we do not believe that possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on our future earnings or cash flows and  therefore  have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a sudden and significant decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar 
interest rates we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  interest bearing demand deposit accounts with financial institutions  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the us government 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are only invested in short term deposits of the local operating bank 
we classify our investment instruments as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income or could impact the fair market value of our investments 
however  we believe these changes in interest rates will not cause a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
