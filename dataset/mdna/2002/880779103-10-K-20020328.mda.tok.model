item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations on april   the company announced that it was implementing a modified organizational structure effective may  on may   the company began operating primarily in two business segments i terex americas and mining and ii terex europe 
previously  the company had reported its operations as terex earthmoving and terex lifting 
on august   the company announced that the terex americas and mining group was being divided into two separate business segments i terex americas and ii terex mining 
therefore  commencing in the third quarter of  the company began operating primarily in three business segments i terex americas  ii terex europe  and iii terex mining 
all prior periods have been restated to reflect results based on the three current business segments 
the company implemented these organizational changes in response to the growth and diversity of the company s business 
while the product focus represented by having earthmoving and lifting segments assisted the company s growth  both in the united states and internationally  as the company s product offerings expanded it resulted in customers in many cases having to deal with multiple sales and marketing groups within the company 
this made the company s objective of satisfying its customers more difficult to achieve 
the company  while increasingly global  believes that ultimately its business is a local one that can best be developed and served by focusing its operations geographically and by developing local relationships among equipment users  distribution channels and suppliers 
for that reason  the company created the terex americas and terex europe segments 
the terex mining business remains organized under product  and not geographic  lines because of the worldwide scope of the mining business 
in the mining industry  manufacturers and customers are located in various areas around the globe  with many customers operating multiple sites in widely dispersed locations  with the result that local geographic concerns are far less significant than a manufacturer s global range 
terex americas includes the results of all business units located in north and south america  australia and asia  with the exception of those business units included within terex mining 
the results for terex americas include the operations of jaques and its affiliates collectively the jaques group and cmi and its affiliates since january  and october   their respective dates of acquisition 
the results for terex americas include the operations of the company s princeton division through september   the date it was sold 
the results for include the operations of coleman since october   its date of acquisition 
terex europe includes the results of all business units located in europe with the exception of those business units included within terex mining 
the results for terex europe include the operations of fermec and its affiliates which were acquired on december  the results for terex europe include the operations of moffett engineering limited and the company s kooi division collectively the european truck mounted forklift business and along with princeton  the truck mounted forklift business  through september   the date they were sold 
terex mining includes the results of the terex mining operations in tulsa  oklahoma  the o k mining business located in germany and certain sales offices in australia  south america and africa

during the third quarter of  the company announced that a number of its current production facilities would reduce staffing  seven facilities would be closed and their activities consolidated into other terex facilities and that other additional non recurring expenses would be incurred 
the restructuring program is designed to maximize factory utilization and to leverage common purchasing  engineering and marketing operations in the americas and europe 
the majority of facility consolidations occurred in and the plan is expected to be fully implemented by the end of the second quarter of the company recorded costs of million during for severance and consolidation costs related to these actions as well as other non recurring expenses 
the severance costs  totaling approximately million  are for the elimination of approximately positions in connection with the aforementioned plant consolidations and staff reductions 
other costs  totaling approximately million  include plant consolidation costs and related asset write offs of which approximately million represents non cash charges 
these costs have been included in cost of sales million and selling  general and administrative expenses million in the consolidated statement of income

consistent with its plan at the time of acquisition  the company has announced its intention to close four of cmi s existing facilities and consolidate the work into cmi s oklahoma city location 
these closures will eliminate approximately positions and are expected to be completed during the first quarter of costs related to these closures are expected to be included in the purchase accounting for cmi and will not be recorded as operating expenses

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on the company s financial results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that the following are among its most significant accounting polices which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events and which utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management judgment 
please refer to note a significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of the company s accounting policies 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
in valuing inventory  management is required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of used equipment taken in trade from customers requires the company to use the best information available to determine the value of the equipment to potential customers 
this value is subject to change based on numerous conditions 
inventory reserves are established taking into account age  frequency of use  or sale  and in the case of repair parts  the installed base of machines 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events which could significantly influence management s judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where the company s products are sold  new equipment price fluctuations  competitive actions including the introduction of new products and technological advances  as well as new products and design changes introduced by the company 
at december   management had established reserves of million for excess and obsolete inventory 
accounts receivable management is required to make judgments about the collectibility of accounts receivables from the company s customers 
valuation of receivables includes evaluating customer payment histories  customer leverage  availability of third party finance  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors which cannot be predicted with certainty 
at december   reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million 
guarantees the company has issued million in guarantees of customer financing to purchase equipment as of december  the company must assess the probability of losses or non performance in ways similar to the evaluation of accounts receivable  including consideration of a customer s payment history  leverage  availability of third party finance  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
to date  losses related to guarantees have been negligible 
revenue recognition revenue and costs are generally recorded when products are shipped and invoiced to either independently owned and operated dealers or to customers 
certain new units may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
revenue is recognized in such cases only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the units  the units have been completed  tested and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has requested that the company hold the units for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the units are invoiced under the company s customary billing terms  title to the units and risks of ownership pass to the customer upon invoicing  the units are segregated from the company s inventory and identified as belonging to the customer  and the company has no further obligations under the order 
revenues are recognized generally when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
the company s customers include rental companies  finance companies and owner operators 
in certain cases  the products are purchased for retailing 
in some cases recognizing revenue requires evaluating the stability and reason for purchase by the customer  performance commitments  probability of returns and other factors 
goodwill goodwill  representing the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets tangible and intangible and liabilities at the date of acquisition  is amortized on a straight line basis over between fifteen and forty years 
in order to determine the amount of goodwill  management uses estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of assets acquired 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in accordance with the company s adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized 
however  the value assigned to goodwill must be reviewed annually to determine if its estimated value exceeds the carrying value 
estimates of future discounted cash flows are one of the principal methods that will be used by the company to value goodwill 
there are no assurances that future cash flow assumptions will be achieved  nor are there assurances that the values placed on goodwill will be attainable 
impairment of long lived assets the company s policy is to assess the realizability of its long lived assets and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows is less than its carrying value 
there are no assurances that future cash flow assumptions will be achieved 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between estimated future discounted cash flows and the carrying value of the asset 
accrued warranties the company records accruals for potential warranty claims based on the company s prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the performance of new products  models and technology  changes in weather conditions for product operation  different uses for products and other similar factors 
accrued product liability the company records accruals for potential product liability claims based on the company s prior claim experience 
accruals for product liability claims are valued based upon the company s prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside counsel  analysis of internal product liability counsel and the experience of the company s director of product safety 
the company provides self insurance accruals for estimated product liability experience on known claims 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables such as the decisions of juries or judges

the company will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions  some of which could individually or in the aggregate be material  which complement the company s core operations and offer cost reduction opportunities  distribution and purchasing synergies and product diversification 
debt reduction and an improved capital structure are major focal points for the company 
the company regularly reviews its alternatives to improve its capital structure and to reduce debt service through debt refinancings  issuance of equity  asset sales  including strategic dispositions of business units  or any combination thereof

the company has significant debt service requirements  including semi annual interest payments on its senior subordinated notes and monthly interest payments on its bank credit facilities 
management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the company s bank credit facilities and cash on hand  provides the company with adequate liquidity to meet the company s operating and debt service requirements 
no principal payments are required under the company s bank facility or subordinated notes until march other than default under the terms of the company s debt instruments  there are no other events that would accelerate the repayment of the company s debt 
the company s main sources of funding are cash generated from operations and access to the company s bank credit facilities  as well as the company s ability to access the capital markets 
additionally  the company sells insured customer accounts receivable to lending institutions to accelerate the collection of cash 
cash generated from operations is directly tied to the amount of the company s sales 
a decrease in sales will have a negative impact on the company s ability to derive liquidity from its operations 
sales are subject to decline for a number of reasons  including economic conditions  weather  competition and foreign currency fluctuations 
a significant portion of sales are financed by third party finance companies in reliance on the credit worthiness of the company s customers and the estimated residual value of its equipment 
deterioration in the credit quality of the company s customers or the estimated residual value of its equipment could negatively impact the ability of such customers to obtain the resources needed to make purchases from the company and could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or financial condition of the company 
the company s ability to borrow under its existing bank credit facilities is subject to the company s ability to comply with a number of covenants 
the company s bank credit facilities include covenants regarding interest coverage  fixed charge coverage and leverage  among others 
these covenants require quarterly compliance and become more restrictive annually 
maintaining compliance with these ratios depends on the future performance of the company and the achievement of cost savings and earning levels anticipated in acquisitions 
the company s ability to access the capital markets to raise funds  through sale of equity or debt securities  is subject to various factors  some specific to the company and some impacted by general economic conditions 
these include results of operations  projected results and debt to equity leverage 
the company s contractual cash obligations at december   are as follows payments due by year total there committed after long term debt  capital lease obligations operating leases additionally at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million and had issued million in guarantees of customer financing to purchase equipment 
contingencies and uncertainties euro in  of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency  the euro 
since the euro has traded on currency exchanges and could be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins were issued  and legacy currencies began to be withdrawn from circulation 
the company s operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion previously assessed the systems and business issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues included  among others  the need to adapt computer and other business systems and equipment to accommodate euro denominated transaction and the competitive impact of cross border price transparency  which may make it more difficult for businesses to charge different prices for the same products on a country by country basis  since the euro currency was issued in to date the euro conversion has not had a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currencies and interest rate risk the company s products are sold in over countries around the world and  accordingly  revenues of the company are generated in foreign currencies  while the costs associated with those revenues are only partly incurred in the same currencies 
the major foreign currencies  among others  in which the company does business are the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar 
the company may  from time to time  hedge specifically identified committed cash flows in foreign currencies using forward currency sale or purchase contracts 
such foreign currency contracts have not historically been material in amount 
the company manages exposure to fluctuating interest rates with interest protection arrangements 
certain of the company s obligations  including indebtedness under the company s bank credit facility  bear interest at floating rates  and as a result an increase in interest rates could adversely affect  among other things  the results of operations of the company 
the company has entered into interest protection arrangements with respect to approximately million of the principal amount of its indebtedness under its bank credit facility  fixing interest at various rates between and

changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
in addition  all hedging relationships must be reassessed and documented pursuant to the provisions of sfas no

other the company is subject to a number of contingencies and uncertainties including  without limitation  product liability claims  self insurance obligations  tax examinations and guarantees 
many of the exposures are unasserted or proceedings are at a preliminary stage  and it is not presently possible to estimate the amount or timing of any cost to the company 
however  the company does not believe that these contingencies and uncertainties will  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the company 
when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and possible to make reasonable estimates of the company s liability with respect to such matters  a provision is recorded for the amount of such estimate or for the minimum amount of a range of estimates when it is not possible to estimate the amount within the range that is most likely to occur 
the company generates hazardous and nonhazardous wastes in the normal course of its manufacturing operations 
as a result  terex is subject to a wide range of federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations

these laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances 
compliance with these laws and regulations has  and will continue to require  the company to make expenditures 
the company does not expect that these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on its business or profitability
