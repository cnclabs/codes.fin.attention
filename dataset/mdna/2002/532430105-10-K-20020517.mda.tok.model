although management has developed plans which should enable the company to achieve sufficient income levels in the future  there can be no assurance that the plans will be successful in enabling the company to generate sufficient taxable income in the periods in which the net expenses become deductible

in addition  the company will be required to conduct an annual review of goodwill for potential impairment 
the adoption of fas nos 
and for fiscal will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements since goodwill amortization for fiscal totaled forward looking statements except for the historical information contained herein  statements included in this form k may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements relate to the company s future performance  including  without limitation  statements with respect to the company s anticipated results of operations  revenues  cash flows and or level of business 
such statements represent the company s current expectations only and are subject to certain risks  assumptions and uncertainties 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated or projected 
among the factors that could cause actual results to materially differ include the overall strength of the economy  the level of consumer confidence and spending  customer preferences  circulation changes and other initiatives  increased competition in the direct mail industry and from the growing internet market  changes in government regulations  risks associated with the social  political  economic and other conditions affecting foreign sourcing  including possible disruptions caused by the current global situation  and possible future increases in operating costs including postage and paper costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates in addition to the forward looking estimates and assumptions mentioned in the paragraph above  the accounting policies listed below represent the company s most critical accounting policies with respect to the financial results reported 
provision for inventory allowance the company records a charge to cost of goods sold in the current year related to products in inventory that it expects to sell below its cost 
these estimates are based on assumptions of future sales  prices  and disposition plans 
if actual sales are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs may be required 
catalog costs catalog costs are deferred and amortized over the estimated useful life of the catalog  generally three months 
the estimated life is based on the projected total revenues of the catalog 
the related costs of the catalog are expensed according to the percentage that actual revenue as of an income statement date comprises of total revenue projected at that time 
should this future sales projection prove to be incorrect  catalog costs may not be properly matched to the proper periods that include the revenues 
income taxes as discussed above  the company s realization of future benefits from its net deferred tax asset of million recorded on the books as of february  is dependent upon the generation of sufficient amounts of future taxable income during the years in which the net expenses become deductible 
the company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods is contingent upon a number of factors  including general economic conditions and the company s sales levels in future periods 
although management has developed plans which should enable the company to achieve sufficient income levels in the future  there can be no assurance that the plans will be successful in enabling the company to generate sufficient taxable income in the periods in which the net expenses become deductible 
however  the company has developed certain tax planning strategies relating to the sale and leaseback of certain of its facilities  which could be employed  if necessary  to generate taxable income in amounts sufficient enough to offset the impact of the net deductible expenses 
accordingly  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance with respect to the net deferred tax asset as of february  if the company was not able to structure such a sale and leaseback arrangement with a suitable buyer  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period such a determination was made 
capitalized software costs capitalized software costs are amortized over estimated useful lives of two to five years 
should it be decided that the actual useful lives of these assets are less than those estimated due to technology changes or operability of the software or other reason  there would be a significant negative impact on the future earnings of the company 
paper hedge contract the company has a collar hedge contract with a third party

the fair value of the company s contract is based on projected future paper prices 
the price of paper is dependent upon supply and demand in the marketplace 
if paper prices vary from those estimated  the company would be required to record an additional liability 
the current treatment of the contract may result in greater earnings volatility 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s earnings are impacted by fluctuating paper prices 
in order to partially mitigate this risk  the company implemented a price protection program by entering into a collar hedge contract 
this contract covers certain grades of paper used by the company  among other grades  to produce its catalogs 
there is a floor and ceiling on paper prices within the contract 
if paper prices remain within the range of the contract  there would be no payment to either party to the contract 
if paper prices exceed the established ceiling  the company is entitled to be reimbursed by the counterparty for the excess 
conversely  if paper prices fall below the established floor  the company must pay the counterparty 
the company did not pay a premium at the inception of the contract 
the contract has an expiration date of august the collar hedge contract had been designated as and was effective as a hedge through november during the nine months ended november   the ineffectiveness related to the collar hedge contract was not significant 
enron filed for bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of fiscal in view of enron s financial situation  the company discontinued hedge accounting during the fourth quarter 
as a result  amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses under hedge accounting of million net of taxes of million through november  will continue to be reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the paper costs 
further  any changes in the fair value of the contract subsequent to november  will be recorded in earnings 
the fair value of the contract at february  was million  which is included in other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet 
total amounts recorded in earnings for the year ended february  approximated  the company is hedging transactions through august as of february   the company estimates derivative losses of approximately million net of taxes reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses will be reclassified to earnings within the next months 
changes in future paper prices will result in changes in the fair market value of the contract  thus the company cannot predict what  if any  financing expenses under the contract may be incurred in fiscal to date  the company has not been entitled to receive any payments from enron under the hedge agreement 
presently  the company does not know what effect enron s bankruptcy will have upon the collar hedge contract 
the company s management and legal counsel are currently exploring the status of the contract
