item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate overview we are one of the largest printers in north america competing primarily in the commercial printing and envelope market segments 
we believe we are the world s largest manufacturer of envelopes  the leading printer of envelopes in the united states and canada  the premier high impact color printer in the united states  and a leading general commercial printer in several major us markets 
we operate facilities throughout north america in our commercial printing and envelope businesses 
the combination of our broad printing facility network and our sales force  which is among the largest in the industry  has enabled us to build our primary customer base to over  customers 
in may  we completed a comprehensive review of our operations and adopted a new strategy that focuses on our two primary businesses commercial printing and envelope 
in support of this strategy  we have announced our intention and are in the process of seeking to divest our label and printed office products businesses and certain other non strategic assets 
accordingly  in the second quarter of  we began reporting the label and printed office products businesses as discontinued operations  began reporting the other non strategic assets as assets held for sale  and recorded a loss of million anticipated on these dispositions 
as a result of a deterioration in the market after september  we recorded an additional charge of million in the fourth quarter 
in february  we sold curtis inc  a printed office products company  for approximately million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the divestitures to reduce our senior secured debt 
in connection with our new strategic plan  we also announced plans to consolidate three of our commercial printing plants into one facility  to close nine of our envelope plants and to redeploy the equipment and assets at other facilities 
we have completed the plant consolidations in commercial printing and three of the closures in envelope  and plan to complete the remaining consolidations by the end of our new strategy includes the launch of several initiatives to significantly improve operations and marketing effectiveness 
both the envelope and commercial printing businesses have programs in place to institute best practices  install pricing disciplines and align equipment and services to better serve our customers and markets 
we believe these initiatives will significantly improve the performance of our businesses 
paper is our most significant raw material 
we purchased approximately  tons of paper in for our envelope and commercial printing businesses 
prices of uncoated papers  which are the principal grades of paper used to manufacture envelopes  decreased in after an increase of approximately at the end of prices of coated papers  which are used principally in commercial printing  increased approximately in but decreased approximately in changes in paper pricing generally do not affect the operating results of our commercial printing business because we can pass on paper price increases to our customers 
paper pricing does  however  impact the operating margins of our envelope business 
when paper prices are rising  operating margins on our envelope products tend to be lower because we generally are not able to increase our prices as quickly as paper prices increase 
thus  when uncoated paper prices increased at the end of  operating margins of the envelope business were negatively impacted in we expect uncoated and coated paper pricing to be stable in our significant growth has been primarily due to our acquisition strategy 
however  we curtailed our acquisitions in in order to concentrate on implementing our strategic plan 
in  we acquired american business products  inc and four smaller companies 
in  we acquired eight companies 
the acquisitions completed in and were accounted for as purchase transactions 
recording acquisitions in this manner impacts comparability of our financial statements because the results of each of the acquired companies are included in the consolidated results from the dates acquired 
the impacts of our acquisitions are included in the following discussions of our results 
consolidated results of operations the financial statements for all periods presented have been restated as required by generally accepted accounting principles to report the results of our label and printed office products businesses as discontinued operations 
the summary financial data set forth in the tables that follow present reported amounts as well as comparable financial data for new mail well 
when we refer to new mail well  we are referring to results of the operations that will constitute mail well subsequent to the planned divestitures of the operations reported as discontinued operations and assets held for sale and that exclude restructuring  asset impairments and other charges reported in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and the economic downturn in adversely affected the sales and margins of both of our primary businesses  especially the portion of our commercial printing business related to print advertising 
the reduced sales and margins have resulted in corresponding decreases in operating income and net income mitigated in part by reductions in operating expenses and interest expense 
sales year ended december change dollars in thousands reported    new mail well    excludes sales of certain operations of our envelope and commercial printing businesses held for sale 
new mail well s sales include sales to curtis inc and other operations being divested  which sales are anticipated to continue subsequent to the dispositions of these operations 
new mail well s sales were down million  or  in excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during  the sales decline was 
the slowdown in the economy during significantly impacted sales 
reductions by our customers in spending on printed advertising material and direct mail promotions impacted sales of commercial printing and envelopes 
problems in the technology  telecommunications and travel industries also adversely affected our business 
new mail well s sales of billion in were million higher than sales in sales contributed by acquisitions completed in and accounted for million of this increase 
internal growth in both our commercial printing and envelope businesses accounted for the remainder 
reported sales in and changed from the prior year in the same proportions and were impacted by the same factors as the sales of new mail well 
restructuring  asset impairments and other charges in connection with our new strategic plan  we developed plans to consolidate certain operations to eliminate excess internal capacity in order to reduce costs and improve our long term competitive position 
the restructuring charges related to these plans totaled million in  and we expect additional charges of approximately million in the following table and discussion present the details of these restructuring charges  as well as other charges recorded in commercial in thousands envelope printing corporate total employee separation and related expenses   lease termination costs   other exit costs    asset impairment charges   strategic assessment costs   total restructuring costs     other charges     restructuring  asset impairments and other charges     our envelope business has implemented a plan to consolidate nine of our manufacturing facilities over an month period 
this plan will substantially reduce excess internal capacity and improve utilization of equipment and resources at the remaining plants 
the separation and related employee costs cover employees to be terminated over the course of this project  of which had been separated as of december  other exit costs include training costs for those employees at the plants that are absorbing the sales of the plants being closed and external assistance in implementing the plant closures 
as of december   we had completed the closure of our facilities in omaha  nebraska  allentown  pennsylvania  and santa fe springs  california 
the million asset impairment charge relates to the write down of equipment taken out of service as a result of these plant closures 
our commercial printing business consolidated three printing operations in the philadelphia  pennsylvania area into one 
this consolidation was done to improve the cost effectiveness of these operations and their competitive position in the philadelphia market 
the costs associated with this consolidation included severance and related expenses covering the termination of employees  all of whom have been terminated 
other exit costs include expenses incurred to move and reinstall equipment 
equipment taken out of service was written down million to its fair market value 
in developing our new strategic plan  we engaged outside advisors to research and evaluate our markets  survey our customers and assess existing strategies 
in addition  we engaged financial advisors to evaluate options for improving our capital structure 
the cost of these advisors was million 
our new strategy includes the launch of several initiatives to significantly improve operations and marketing effectiveness 
both the envelope and commercial printing businesses have programs in place to institute best practices  install pricing disciplines and align equipment and services to better serve our customers and markets 
we believe these initiatives will significantly improve the performance of our businesses  accordingly  we have expedited the implementation of these programs in our commercial printing business by investing in outside assistance 
the external incremental cost incurred for these initiatives totaled million in and is reported as other charges 
other charges include the write off of a million investment in a company developing a service to enable online management of the creative process of a printing job and a million write off of the cost incurred for a human resource information system that will not be implemented 
we began our comprehensive review of our operations in and identified certain actions that could be taken at that time 
the following table and discussion present the details of restructuring charges  as well as other charges recorded in commercial in thousands envelope printing total employee separation and related expenses lease termination costs asset impairment charges other exit costs total restructuring costs   other asset impairments    total restructuring  asset impairments and other charges    our envelope business closed a resale operation in vancouver  washington 
the separation and related employee costs covered the termination of employees  all of whom have been terminated 
our commercial printing business consolidated two operations in st 
louis into an existing facility and closed our bindery operation in mexico 
we reduced our total workforce by employees by taking these actions 
we also incurred asset impairment charges in totaling million that were unrelated to the restructuring 
these assets were taken out of service and could not be redeployed or sold  and therefore were written off 
we completed a restructuring program initiated in during changes related to that program  which were recorded in  totaled million 
impairment of assets held for sale as part of our new strategy  the sale of certain assets that are not strategic to our envelope or commercial printing businesses was approved in may we incurred a charge of million in to write down certain of these assets to fair value 
operating income year ended december change dollars in thousands reported operating income    operating margin new mail well operating income    operating margin excludes operating income in  and of certain operations of our envelope and commercial printing businesses held for sale  the million impairment of assets held for sale in and restructuring  asset impairments and other charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
new mail well s operating income declined in to million 
excluding earnings contributed by acquisitions completed in  the decline was 
the reduction in operating income was primarily due to the estimated million of contribution margin lost on the decline in sales 
increased competition resulting from the lower demand due to the slowdown in the economy impacted contribution margins by approximately million 
offsetting these declines were reductions in fixed manufacturing costs  primarily production support  and administrative expenses  which totaled approximately million during new mail well s operating income in declined 
excluding the million attributable to acquisitions completed in and  the decline was 
this decline was the result of lower margins in our envelope business due to higher paper prices and lower profits in our commercial printing business 
the lower earnings of our commercial printing business were due to a change in the mix of the products sold and to poor operating performance at four manufacturing facilities  including asset write offs and accrual adjustments  totaling million at two of these plants 
corporate expenses were also higher primarily due to special retirement expenses of million recorded in interest expense year ended december change dollars in thousands total interest expense    less allocated to discontinued operations    reported interest expense    less allocated to assets held for sale    new mail well    in  total interest expense declined due to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates 
interest rates and expense are expected to increase in due to anticipated debt refinancing related to the repayment of our convertible notes on or before their maturity at november  in february  we entered into a new senior secured credit facility to finance the acquisition of american business products  inc the increase in interest in was due to higher total borrowings and higher average interest rates 
reported interest is net of an allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations based on the net assets of those operations 
interest expense applicable to new mail well also excludes interest allocated to certain operations of the envelope and commercial printing businesses which are held for sale  based on the net proceeds anticipated from the sales of these assets 
income taxes year ended december dollars in thousands reported provision benefit for income taxes    effective tax rate new mail well provision for income taxes    effective tax rate new mail well s effective tax rate for increased by percentage points due to lower pre tax income  which increased the impact of nondeductible goodwill amortization on the effective rate 
the percentage point decline in new mail well s effective tax rate for was due in part to a reduction in the statutory rates in canada 
in addition  net impact of permanent differences reduced taxable income in the reported effective tax rate for reflects the tax impact of the restructuring charge 
income loss from continuing operations and income per share assuming dilution year ended december change dollars in thousands income loss from continuing operations reported    new mail well    income loss from continuing operations per share assuming dilution reported new mail well excludes income from continuing operations in  and of certain operations of our envelope and commercial printing businesses held for sale  the million impairment of assets held for sale in and restructuring  asset impairments and other charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
new mail well s income loss from continuing operations per share declined in  reflecting a similar decrease in income from continuing operations 
the earnings decline was due to lower sales and lower margins partially offset by lower fixed costs and lower interest expense 
in addition  our reported loss from continuing operations of million  or per share  was also negatively impacted by the restructuring  asset impairment and other charges of million and the impairment charge recorded on assets held for sale of million which are excluded from income from continuing operations of new mail well 
in  income from continuing operations for new mail well declined with a corresponding decrease in earnings per share 
this decline in earnings reflected lower operating margins  higher fixed costs  higher amortization expense and higher interest expense than in loss on discontinued operations in june  we announced our intention to sell our label and printed office products businesses 
generally accepted accounting principles require that our financial statements be restated to exclude the sales and expenses of these business and that their results be reported as discontinued operations 
the loss reported from discontinued operations was million  or per share  after income tax benefits from the loss and included the following o a write down to net realizable value based on estimated sales proceeds  and o the actual and forecasted results of these businesses from the date of the announcement through the expected date of disposal  including an allocation of interest expense 
we have based our estimates of the sales proceeds expected from the divestitures on data provided by our financial advisors and indications of value received from prospective buyers 
the loss will be adjusted once the actual sales proceeds are known or management has information indicating that the actual sales proceeds are likely to differ from the estimates 
we do not expect the actual sales proceeds to be significantly different from those assumed  and we expect to complete these dispositions by june  sales of our label and printed office products businesses in totaled million 
the operating income earned by these businesses in was million 
net income loss and net income loss per share assuming dilution year ended december change dollars in thousands net income loss reported    new mail well    net income loss per share assuming dilution reported new mail well in  the reported net loss was million  or per share assuming dilution 
this loss was due to lower operating results from continuing operations  the restructuring  asset impairments and other charges and the losses recognized on discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
net income in included an extraordinary gain of million 
reported net income and net income per share in were down over from because of lower operating results  higher amortization expense and higher interest expense 
new mail well s net income and net income per share are the same as shown from new mail well s continuing operations because new mail well excludes results of discontinued operations  the impairment on assets held for sale and the restructuring  asset impairments and other charges 
business segments envelope the following table presents the reported sales and operating income of our envelope business  as well as its sales and operating income excluding the results of certain operations that are held for sale and the restructuring charges recorded in and new envelope 
year ended december change dollars in thousands net sales reported    new envelope    operating income reported    new envelope    excludes sales and operating income of certain operations of our envelope business held for sale 
new envelope sales include sales to curtis inc and other operations being divested  which sales are anticipated to continue subsequent to the dispositions of these operations 
new envelope s sales in were down from the prior year 
excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in  sales were down approximately million  or approximately 
this decline was due primarily to the general decline in the economy 
sales to direct mail customers were lower in by approximately million due to reductions in spending on direct mail promotions 
sales of specialty packaging were down approximately million primarily due to reduced demand from the us postal service 
we also experienced lower sales of approximately million in the resale segment of our market as customers reduced inventories 
in  approximately million of new envelope s sales increase was due to the impact of companies acquired in internal growth accounts for the remaining increase of million 
operating income of new envelope was down in from the prior year 
excluding the earnings of companies acquired in the decline was 
the decline in operating income in was due to lower sales and the resulting decrease in gross profit of million 
in response to the lower sales  we reduced fixed manufacturing costs in such that gross profit margin was down only basis points to 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  selling and administrative expenses were down million from reflecting lower sales commissions and reductions in administrative overhead 
in  new envelope s operating income was also down from the prior year 
excluding earnings of companies acquired in and  the decline in operating income was 
in  selling prices remained relatively constant with selling prices in despite higher paper costs in compared to lower margins reduced gross profits by million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  administrative expenses were million lower in than in commercial printing the following table presents the reported sales and operating income of our commercial printing business  as well as its sales and operating income excluding the results of certain of its operations that are held for sale and the restructuring and impairment charges recorded in and new commercial printing 
year ended december change dollars in thousands net sales reported    new commercial printing    operating income reported    new commercial printing    excludes sales and operating income of certain operations of our commercial printing business held for sale 
new commercial printing sales include sales to curtis inc and other operations being divested  which sales are anticipated to continue subsequent to the dispositions of these operations 
the economic slowdown in had a significant impact on our commercial printing business 
sales of new commercial printing were down from the prior year 
excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in  the sales decline was million  or 
customers have reduced spending on advertising in reaction to the recession  which has directly impacted our commercial printing business 
we estimate that approximately of commercial printing sales are related to advertising 
reductions in spending by our customers on print advertising account for approximately of the sales decline in in addition  sales to our technology and telecommunications customers were down approximately million  or approximately of the decline  in the remaining sales decline was due to general reductions in demand and increased competition 
new commercial printing s sales in were up 
excluding the impact of sales by companies acquired in and  the increase was 
sales of annual reports  automotive brochures  magazine inserts and printed educational materials were strong in and responsible for much of this growth 
the decline in operating income of new commercial printing in was primarily related to the significant sales decline in contribution margin lost due to lower sales was more than million 
this reduction was offset by a reduction in administrative expenses  before considering acquisitions  of million 
in  new commercial printing s operating income declined 
excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in and  the decline in operating income was 
despite the increase in sales during  margins declined primarily due to significant operating problems at four of our printing plants 
the operating income at these four plants was million lower in than in  before considering charges of million to write off assets and adjust accruals at two of these plants 
a change in mix of business in also had a negative impact on results 
liquidity and capital resources we generated cash of million from continuing operations in compared to million in and million in while earnings declined in and  non cash charges increased primarily due to the increase in the non cash portion of the restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in and in addition  working capital  which consists of current assets exclusive of cash and cash equivalents  net assets of discontinued operations and net assets held for sale  less current liabilities  exclusive of the current portion of long term debt  was reduced million in to million at december  compared to a reduction of million in and an increase of million capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million in  million in and million in we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in consistent with our new strategy to reduce our leverage  free cash flow in was used primarily to reduce debt 
there were no significant acquisitions in in  we obtained a new senior secured credit facility to fund the acquisition of american business products  inc for million in cash plus million of assumed debt 
we sold the extrusion coating and laminating operation of american business products in september for after tax cash proceeds of approximately million 
other acquisitions in included three commercial printing companies and an envelope company 
the cash paid for these four companies totaled million 
debt was the principal source of funds used in for the acquisitions of seven printing companies and one envelope company for purchase prices totaling million 
we repurchased  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million during we did not repurchase any common stock in and have no plans to do so in in addition  we repurchased million of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes in these transactions reduced the number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis by  and  respectively 
the impact on diluted earnings per share was not material 
the percentage of new mail well s debt to total capital was at december   up from at december  the following table summarizes our cash obligations as of december payments due by period in thousands less than year years and years and thereafter total long term debt      operating leases      total cash obligations      long term debt due during includes the retirement of our convertible notes  other current debt and the portion of our bank borrowings that will be paid from the proceeds from our planned divestitures pursuant to the terms of our senior credit facility  net of amounts that would become available as a result of such repayments under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million related to performance and payment guarantees 
in addition  we have issued letters of credit of million as credit enhancements in conjunction with other debt 
based on our experience with these arrangements  we do not believe that any obligations that may arise will be significant 
our convertible notes mature in november we intend to offer million in new senior debt securities with a ten year maturity  with the net proceeds from the offering used to pay down our senior credit facility 
in conjunction with this offering  we are obtaining an amendment to the senior credit facility that  upon completion of the offering  will allow us to set aside funds under the senior credit facility needed for the retirement of the convertible notes on or before their maturity  subject to meeting applicable borrowing conditions 
we expect to be able to fund our operations  capital expenditures and debt and other contractual commitments over the next months from internally generated cash flow and funds available under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we expect to receive approximately million in proceeds from the sales of our planned divestitures 
at december   we had million of unused available credit under our revolving credit facilities 
outlook the economic downturn in continues to affect our business in we do not expect significant increases in sales or improvements in our margins until the economy  and especially advertising  rebounds 
in the meantime  we have continued to take steps through our strategic initiatives and otherwise to reduce costs and improve our operations 
seasonality and environment our commercial printing business experiences seasonal variations 
our revenues from annual reports are generally concentrated from february through april 
revenues associated with holiday catalogs and automobile brochures tend to be concentrated from july through october  and calendars may to september 
as a result of these seasonal variations  we are at near capacity in some facilities at certain time during these periods 
several consumer direct market segments served by our envelope business  such as photo finishing packaging and certain segments of the direct mail market  experience seasonality  with a higher percentage of volume of products sold to these markets occurring during the fourth quarter of the year 
this seasonality is due to the increase in sales to the direct mail market due to holiday purchases 
seasonality is offset by the diversity of our other products and markets  which are not materially affected by seasonal conditions 
environmental matters have not had a material financial impact on our historical operations and are not expected to have a material impact in the future 
critical accounting policies and judgments in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the most significant judgments made in our financial statements for involve the estimation of net sales proceeds to be received form the sales of our discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
we have based our estimates on indications of value expressed by prospective buyers and the advice of our financial advisors 
we do not expect the actual proceeds to be significantly different from our estimates  however  until we have completed each of our planned divestitures  the possibility exists that actual proceeds could be materially different from our estimates 
we exercise judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment 
we believe our businesses will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments we have made in property  plant and equipment  as well as the goodwill and other intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisitions 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs 
we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
the determination of our tax provision is complex due to the number of acquisitions we have completed and due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the united states 
in addition  realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
additional financial information see exhibit filed with this report for the unaudited consolidating condensed financial information of mail well i corporation  as issuer  certain of its subsidiaries as guarantor subsidiaries  certain of its subsidiaries as non guarantor subsidiaries and mail well  inc as parent guarantor 
these statements are provided for compliance with the reporting requirements under the indenture for the senior subordinated notes due in new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
sfas requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we will apply sfas beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas is expected to result in an increase in net income of million per share in we will reclassify an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of million and a customer relationship intangible asset with unamortized balance of million along with a related deferred tax liability of million to goodwill at the date of adoption 
we will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we expect to complete the first step by june  based on steps we have taken to prepare for the adoption of sfas  it is possible that a portion of the unamortized goodwill related to our commercial printing business  which totals million  will be impaired using the impairment measurement methodology required by sfas we have not yet determined the amount of the potential impairment loss  if any 
any impairment that is required to be recognized when adopting sfas will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of we will complete measurement of any impairment loss upon the initial adoption of sfas no

in june  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we will adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal year we are evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas on the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking information certain statements in this report  and in particular  statements found in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of generally  the words believe  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate  project  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which generally are not historical in nature 
all statements which address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the current views of mail well with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially form those expressed or implied in these statements 
as and when made  management believes that these forward looking statements are reasonable 
however  caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in or underlying the company s forward looking statements o we reported losses for the last three fiscal quarters of primarily as a result of expenses related to our restructuring initiatives and the economic slowdown  which in particular adversely affected our sales to significant advertising and automotive customers and direct mail 
our ability to return to profitability depends in part on our customers recovery from this slowdown and the success of our efforts to reduce operating expenses through our plant consolidations and ongoing cost cutting measures in connection with our recent strategic initiatives 
our operating results are difficult to predict  and we cannot provide assurance we will be successful in achieving increased revenues  positive cash flows or profitability 
o the company has outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
the convertible notes are due november  we expect to use available cash and  to the extent necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility to repay these notes 
the senior credit facility has several conditions to borrowing 
if we are unable to satisfy all of these conditions  we would be unable to borrow under the senior credit facility to repay the convertible notes 
we would then need to obtain the funds to repay the convertible notes through other sources  which funds may not be available to us on favorable terms  on a timely basis or at all 
the company s failure to pay the convertible notes when due would be an event of default under the convertible notes 
o in may  we announced the adoption of a strategic restructuring plan that calls for the divestiture of our label and printed office products businesses 
we currently continue to operate those businesses much as we have in the past but  for accounting purposes  we account for these operations as discontinued operations 
the implementation of our plan to sell these businesses may adversely affect the results of operations of these businesses due to diversion of management s attention  the impact on customers and other factors 
we have sold curtis inc  but we have not entered into any other definitive agreements of sale 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any sale of those businesses  or that the terms  conditions or timing of any sale  if consummated  will achieve the results contemplated by our restructuring plan 
we intend to use the proceeds of these proposed sales to repay some of our existing debt under our senior credit facility 
there can be no assurance that we will receive cash proceeds in the amounts contemplated by our strategic plan to retire a material amount of existing debt 
in addition  if any proposed sale is consummated  we may have to retain certain liabilities associated with those business segments prior operations  including pension benefit obligations  environmental liabilities and indemnification obligations customarily contained in sale agreements 
o in the past  we have grown rapidly through acquisitions 
although we believe that our experience in making acquisitions is an important asset  our strategic plan and the terms of our senior credit facility limit the acquisitions that we may currently pursue 
to the extent that we pursue acquisitions  we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify and acquire other businesses on favorable terms or that  if we are able to acquire businesses on favorable terms  we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our current business or profitably manage them 
o the printing industry in which we compete is generally characterized by individual orders from customers or short term contracts 
most of our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase products or services from us 
most customer orders are for specific printing jobs  and repeat business largely depends on our customers satisfaction with the work we do 
although our business does not depend on any one customer or group of customers  we cannot be sure that any particular customer will continue to do business with us for any period of time 
in addition  the timing of particular jobs or types of jobs at particular times of year may cause significant fluctuations in the operating results of our various printing operations in any given quarter 
we depend to some extent on sales to certain industries such as the advertising and automotive industries 
we estimate that approximately of our commercial printing sales are related to advertising 
to the extent these industries experience downturns  as is currently the case in advertising  the results of our operations are adversely affected 
o the printing industry in which we compete is extremely fragmented and highly competitive 
in the commercial printing market  we compete against a number of large  diversified and financially stronger printing companies  as well as regional and local commercial printers  many of which are capable of competing with us on volume  price and production quality 
in the envelope market  we compete primarily with a few multi plant and many single plant companies servicing regional and local markets 
there currently is excess capacity in the printing industry  which could result in excessive price competition 
we are constantly seeking ways to reduce our costs and become more efficient competitor 
however  we cannot be certain that these efforts will be successful or that our competitors will not be more successful in their similar efforts to reduce costs and become more efficient 
if we fail to reduce costs and increase productivity  we may face decreased profit margins in markets where we encounter price competition  which in turn could reduce our cash flow and profitability 
o most envelopes used in the united states and canada are sent through the mail and as a result  postal rates can significantly affect envelope usage 
historically  increases in postal rates  relative to changes in the cost of alternative delivery means and or advertising media  have resulted in temporary reductions in the growth rate of mail sent  including direct mail  which is a significant portion of our envelope volume 
we cannot be sure that direct mail marketers will not reduce their volume as a result of any increases 
because rate increases in the us and canada are outside our control  we can provide no assurance that any increases in us and or canadian postal rates will not have a negative effect on the level of mail sent  or the volume of envelopes purchased  in either or both countries 
in such event  we would expect to experience a decrease in cash flow and profitability or financial position 
factors other than postal rates that detrimentally affect the volume of mail sent through the u 
s 
and canadian postal systems may also negatively affect our business 
if the threats of mass bio terrorism in the u 
s 
mail system persist  or if there is a perception of a lack of safety in the u 
s 
or canadian postal systems  we cannot be sure that direct mail marketers will not reduce their volume as a result of any such persisting threats or insecurity  or that such decreases in demand will not have a negative effect on the level of mail sent or the volume of envelopes purchased 
o as of december   we had approximately  full time employees  of whom approximately  were members of various local labor unions 
if our unionized employees were to engage in a concerted strike or other work stoppage  or if other employees were to become unionized  we could experience a disruption of operations  higher labor costs or both 
a lengthy strike could result in a material decrease in our cash flow or profitability 
o paper costs represent a significant portion of our cost of materials 
changes in paper pricing generally do no affect the operating margins of our commercial printing business because we historically have been able to pass on paper price increases and increased proceeds from waste paper sales 
paper pricing does  however  impact the operating margins of our envelope business because we generally are not able to increase our prices as quickly as paper prices increase 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to pass on future increases in the cost of paper 
moreover  rising paper costs and their consequent impact on our pricing could lead to a decrease in our volume of units sold 
for example  successive paper price increases during late and early resulted in a decline in demand for our products  particularly from the direct mail advertising industry 
although we have been successful in negotiating favorable pricing terms with paper vendors  we cannot be certain we will be successful in negotiating favorable pricing terms in the future 
this may result in decreased sales volumes as well as decreased cash flow and profitability 
due to the significance of paper in the manufacture of most of our products  we depend on the availability of paper 
during periods of tight paper supply  many paper producers allocate shipments of paper based on the historical purchase levels of customers 
as a result of our large volume paper purchases from several paper producers  we generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate quantities of paper  although we have occasionally experienced minor delays in delivery 
although we believe that our attractiveness to vendors as a large volume paper purchaser will continue to enable us to receive adequate supplies of paper in the future  unforeseen developments in world paper markets coupled with shortages of raw paper could result in a decrease in supply  which in turn would cause a decrease in the volume of products we could produce and sell and a corresponding decrease in cash flow and profitability 
o our envelope manufacturing and printing business is highly dependent upon the demand for envelopes sent through the mail 
such demand comes from utility companies  banks and other financial institutions  among others 
our printing business also depends upon demand for printed advertising and business forms  among others 
customers increasingly use the internet and other electronic media to purchase goods and services  and for other purposes such as paying utility and credit card bills 
advertisers use them for targeted campaigns directed at specific electronic user groups 
large and small businesses use electronic media to conduct business  send invoices and collect bills 
as a result  we expect the demand for envelopes and other printed materials for these purposes to decline 
although we expect countervailing trends  such as the growth of targeted direct mail campaigns based upon mailing lists generated by electronic purchases  to cause overall demand for envelopes and other printed materials to continue to grow at rates comparable to recent historical levels  we cannot be certain that the acceleration of the trend towards electronic media such as the internet and other alternative media will not cause a decrease in the demand for our products 
o our operations are subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to air emissions  wastewater discharge  waste generation  handling  management and disposal  and remediation of contaminated sites 
in addition  some of the sellers from which we have bought businesses in the past have been designated as potentially responsible parties under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or cercla  or similar legislation in canada  with respect to off site disposal of hazardous waste at two sites 
cercla imposes strict  and in certain circumstances joint and several  liability for response costs 
liability may also include damages to natural resources 
we believe that we have minimal exposure as a result of such designations  either because indemnities obtained in the course of acquisitions or because of the de minimis nature of the claims  or both 
we also believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we cannot be certain  however  that available indemnities will be adequate to cover all costs or that currently unknown conditions or matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future 
o our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our executive officers and other key management personnel 
we do not as a matter of policy have employment agreements with our executive officers 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management in the future 
the success of our new strategic plan may depend  in part  on our ability to retain management personnel during the implementation of the plan 
in addition  the success of any acquisitions we may pursue may depend  in part  on our ability to retain management personnel of the acquired companies 
we do not carry key person insurance on any of our managerial personnel 
the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect results of operations and financial position 
risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
we do not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes  nor do we currently hedge interest rate exposure through the use of swaps and options or foreign exchange exposure through the use of forward contracts 
exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations 
the interest on this debt is the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin 
at december  and  we had variable rate debt outstanding of million and million  respectively 
a increase in libor on the maximum amount available under our credit agreement  which is million  would increase our interest expense by million and reduce our net income by approximately million 
we have operations in canada  the united kingdom and mexico  and are exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the canadian dollar  the british pound and the mexican peso
