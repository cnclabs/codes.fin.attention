we provide wireless caribbean wireless and several broadband services including switched voice  dedicated private line  video and other services caribbean broadband over our own fiber optic  coaxial and microwave network in the caribbean 
in the united states  we own and operate wireless systems and provide wireless service in six states in two clusters of small cities and rural areas covering a population of approximately million as of may  indiana michigan ohio and texas louisiana mississippi us wireless 
these clusters are adjacent to major metropolitan markets and have benefited from the traffic generated by subscribers roaming into our coverage areas 
collectively  our wireless licenses cover a total of million net pops as of may  see the subsequent events section below for a discussion of the sale of our jamaican wireless operation and agreement to sell our jamaican internet service provider operation 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition wireless revenue we recognize wireless service revenue in the period the service is provided to our customers 
services billed in advance are recognized as income when earned 
we have multiple billing cycles  all of which span our quarter ends 
as a result of our billing cycle cut off times  we are required to make estimates for service revenue earned but not yet billed at the end of each quarter 
these estimates are based primarily on the actual results of the immediately preceding comparable billing cycle 
actual billing cycle results and related revenue may vary  depending on subscriber usage and rate plan mix  from the results estimated at the end of each quarter 
revenues from activation fees are recognized over the expected customer service period  ranging from to months 
revenues from prepaid calling cards are recognized as the customer uses the minutes on the cards 
revenues from other services are recognized when earned 
revenues from sales of handsets and accessories are recognized in the period these products are sold to the customer 
broadband revenue we recognize revenues from cable television installation fees to the extent of direct selling costs in the period the installation is provided to the customer 
revenues from prepaid long distance cards are recognized as the customer uses the minutes on the cards 
revenues from other services are recognized when earned 
revenues from equipment sales are recognized in the period these products are sold to the customer 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment  license costs  goodwill and franchise license costs are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in our valuation  we consider current market values of properties similar to our own  competition  prevailing economic conditions  government policy including taxation and the historical and current growth patterns of both the company and the industry 
we also consider the recoverability of the 
table of contents cost of our long lived assets based on a comparison of estimated undiscounted operating cash flows for the businesses which generated long lived assets with the carrying value of the long lived assets 
during the fourth quarter of the year ended may   we recorded a pre tax loss on impairment of assets of million related to a write down of our jamaica operations and certain non caribbean undersea fiber optic cables 
these write downs were taken due to a decrease in the estimated future cash flows of these assets 
fair value was determined based on current market values of similar assets 
the loss on impairment of assets included million and million related to assets included in the caribbean wireless and caribbean broadband segments  respectively 
derivative financial instruments we use financial derivatives as part of our overall risk management strategy 
these instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates 
our portfolio of derivative financial instruments primarily consists of interest rate swap and collar agreements 
we use interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations  thereby reducing our exposure to higher interest rates 
we use interest rate collar agreements to lock in a maximum interest rate if interest rates rise  but allow us to otherwise pay lower market rates  subject to a floor 
amounts paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change with the offset recorded in interest expense 
on june   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 our interest rate swaps and collar qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
we recorded a transition adjustment of million  net of tax  in other comprehensive loss attributable to fair value adjustments of interest rate swap and collar agreements

table of contents based upon existing market conditions and our present capital structure  we believe that cash flows from operations and funds from currently available credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to meet required cash commitments through the next twelve month period 
centennial  its subsidiaries  affiliates and controlling stockholders including welsh  carson  anderson stowe and the blackstone group and their respective affiliates may from time to time  depending upon market conditions  seek to purchase certain of centennial s or its subsidiaries securities in the open market or by other means  in each case to the extent permitted by existing covenant restrictions 
acquisitions  exchanges and dispositions our primary acquisition strategy is to obtain controlling ownership interests in communications systems serving markets that are proximate to or share a community of interest with our current markets 
we may pursue acquisitions of communications businesses that we believe will enhance our scope and scale 
our strategy of clustering our operations in proximate geographic areas enables us to achieve operating and cost efficiencies as well as joint marketing benefits  and also allows us to offer our subscribers more areas of uninterrupted service as they travel 
in addition to expanding our existing clusters  we also may seek to acquire interests in communications businesses in other geographic areas 
the consideration for such acquisitions may consist of shares of stock  cash  assumption of liabilities  a combination thereof or other forms of consideration 
in november  we increased our equity ownership interest in aacr to from 
the shareholder in aacr  abraham selman  has the right through november to contribute additional funds to aacr to purchase additional equity in aacr and restore his equity interest 
we recently determined that the minority partner s share of losses in excess of the minority partner s net investment would no longer be recorded against the minority interest in our dominican republic operations 
though we have received commitments from our minority partner in the dominican republic that he will make additional capital contributions  no contributions have been received since november management believes  based upon market conditions and current events  that there is uncertainty as to whether additional capital contributions will occur 
as such  we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of the year ended may  to reduce the minority interest in our dominican republic operations to zero
