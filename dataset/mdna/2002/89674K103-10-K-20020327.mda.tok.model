overview we are a leading supplier of high performance components and modules for communications applications 
we design  develop  manufacture and market a broad range of high performance integrated circuits  bandpass filters  resonators  oscillators and other products for electronic communications markets 
the specific applications served by our products in these communications markets include wireless phones  base stations  optical networks and broadband and microwave equipment with a specific focus on radio frequency rf  analog  and mixed signal applications 
our components and modules are incorporated into a variety of communications products  including wireless phones and pagers  base stations for wireless communications  digital microwave communication systems  fiber optic telecommunications equipment  satellite communications systems  data and wireless local area networking products  broadband access systems and aerospace applications 
we provide customers with standard and custom products as well as foundry services 
our products are designed on various wafer substrates such as gallium arsenide gaas  silicon germanium sige and quartz  using a variety of technologies including pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor phemt  heterojunction bipolar transistor hbt  heterostructure field effect transistor hfet  metal semiconductor field effect transistor mesfet and surface acoustic wave saw 
using these materials  devices and our proprietary technology  our products can overcome the performance barriers of competing devices in a variety of applications and offer other key advantages such as steeper selectivity  lower distortion  reduced size and weight and more precise frequency control 
for example  gaas has inherent physical properties that allow its electrons to move up to five times faster than those of silicon 
this higher electron mobility permits the manufacture of gaas integrated circuits that operate at much higher speeds than silicon devices  or operate at the same speeds with reduced power consumption 
we sell our products worldwide to end user customers  including agere systems  inc  the boeing company  ericsson inc  finisar corp  lg group  motorola  inc  nokia corporation  nortel  raytheon company and samsung microelectronics 
in the united states  we have design and manufacturing facilities in oregon  texas and florida and a design facility in massachusetts 
we also have a production plant in costa rica and a design facility in taiwan 
we own and operate our own advanced wafer fabrication and product test facilities and use our proprietary processes produce rf  analog and mixed signal components and modules cost effectively in high volumes 
we believe that control of these manufacturing processes provides us with a reliable source of supply  greater opportunities to enhance quality and reliability and manufacturing efficiency 
in addition  control of our manufacturing processes and combined with our extensive research and design capabilities assists us to develop new processes and products and to be more responsive to customer requirements 
we also have a strategic foundry business serving leading communications companies 
we are incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware 
our principal executive offices are located at ne brookwood parkway  hillsboro  oregon and our telephone number at this location is accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we review our estimates  including  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts  sales returns reserves  inventory reserves  income tax valuation and warranty reserves on a regular basis and make adjustments based on historical experiences and existing and expected future conditions 
these evaluations are performed regularly and adjustments are made as information is available 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we recognize revenues on standard products upon shipment of product with provisions established for estimated customer and distributor product returns 
generally  we ship products fob shipping point 
we recognize revenues on certain foundry and customer specific products based on certain design  manufacturing and other milestones 
we recognize revenues on cost plus contracts as work is performed 
revenues from customers who have acceptance criteria are not recognized until all acceptance criteria are satisfied 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we use a standard cost methodology to determine our cost basis for our inventories 
this methodology approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
our accounts receivables represent those amounts  which have been billed to our customers but not yet collected 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for the portion of those accounts which we determine may become uncollectible 
our cash investment portfolio  both restricted and unrestricted portions  are classified as available for sale securities and are comprised of highly rated  short and medium term investments  such as us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies  corporate debt securities and similar low risk investments 
although we manage investments under an investment policy  economic  market and other events may occur to our investees  which we cannot control 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
merger with sawtek inc on july   sawtek became a wholly owned subsidiary of triquint 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of sawtek 
additionally  outstanding options to purchase shares of sawtek common stock were exchanged for options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests transaction and qualified as a tax free exchange of shares 
we expensed merger related costs of approximately million in the third quarter of merger related costs consisted primarily of investment banker  legal  accounting  regulatory filings and printing fees 
all financial information in this document has been restated to include the historical information of sawtek 
sawtek had certain differences in the classification of certain assets and liabilities in its historical balance sheets compared to triquint 
material differences of sawtek s presentation were conformed to reflect triquint s presentation 
triquint s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and were combined with sawtek s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the years ended september  and september   respectively 
triquint s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december  was combined with sawtek s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of september  sawtek s results for the quarter ended december  were  which was recorded as a component of triquint s retained earnings 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
years ended december  revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative impairment of long lived assets merger related costs total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income tax and extraordinary item income tax expense benefit income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item retirement of debt  net of tax net income loss comparison of and revenues we derive revenues from the sale of standard and customer specific products and services 
our revenues also include nonrecurring engineering revenues relating to the development of customer specific products 
revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease in revenues was due to the reduced sales of wireless phones  over capacity of optical networks resulting in lower sales of our components  lower overall demand for base stations as the operators cut back on capital spending and the overall depressed economy 
domestic and international revenues were million and million  respectively  in as compared to million and million  respectively  in revenues are expected to be slightly lower in compared to primarily due to the continued softness in our optical network business reduced sales of products for wireless phones in the early part of the year  offset in part by expected increases in revenues for the products for base stations and defense applications 
gross profit gross profit is equal to revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was comprised of all direct material  labor and overhead expenses and certain production costs related to nonrecurring engineering revenues 
in general  gross profit generated from the sale of customer specific products and from nonrecurring engineering revenues is typically higher than gross profit generated from the sale of standard products 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit margin decreased to in compared to in this decrease was mainly due to lower factory utilization and  in part  by the reduction in average selling prices of certain saw filter products 
we expect that our gross profit margin to be similar in compared with additionally  we have at various times in the past experienced lower than expected production yields  which have delayed shipments of a given product and adversely affected gross profits 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain acceptable production yields in the future and  to the extent that we do not achieve acceptable production yields  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
operating expenses research  development and engineering research  development and engineering expenses include certain costs incurred in the design of products associated with nonrecurring engineering revenues  as well as ongoing product development and research and development expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses increased in to million from million in research  development and engineering expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the increase in research  development and engineering expenses on an absolute dollar basis is primarily due to costs associated with the development of new products such as the hbt power amplifiers  sige based products  saw based duplexers and various receivers 
additionally  we had engineering and requalification costs associated with the start up and move to our richardson facility 
we are committed to substantial investments in research  development and engineering and expect these expenses will be approximately the same in compared with selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared to in while our revenues declined in  our selling  general and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged as these costs are somewhat fixed in the short term 
impairment charge long lived assets impairment charge long lived assets was million in  which was a charge relating to the write down of certain equipment and facilities due to excess capacity 
merger related costs merger related costs were million in  attributable to the merger with sawtek in july merger related costs consisted primarily of investment banker  legal  accounting  regulatory filings and printing fees associated with the merger of sawtek during fiscal third quarter 
other income expense  net other income expense  net includes interest income  interest expense and other expenses 
other income expense  net decreased to an expense of million in as compared to income of million in this decrease resulted primarily from decreased interest income due to the reduced interest rates on high quality short term securities and an impairment charge for investments in privately held technology companies 
these investments were in small companies whose valuations declined significantly in due to the overall decline in private technology company valuations 
the book value of our private equity investments is now approximately million 
we expect other income expense  net to be close to zero for as interest earned on investments  at current market interest rates  will be offset by interest expense on our convertible subordinated notes 
income tax expense benefit in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million compared to the income tax expense of million recorded in the income tax benefit related to the operating loss before tax and extraordinary item recorded in our effective tax rate was a benefit in compared to a expense in at december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards to offset against future income for federal income tax purposes  which expire from through  and million for oregon state income tax purposes  which expire in years through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  relating to the investment impairment recorded in we established this valuation allowance since capital losses are limited to the extent of capital gains 
extraordinary item retirement of debt  net of tax extraordinary item retirement of debt  net of tax resulted from our repurchase in of million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes at the then current market prices 
this purchase resulted in an extraordinary gain of million  less income taxes of million 
we had no similar extraordinary item in from time to time  we may repurchase additional notes in the open market 
supplemental pro forma net income supplemental pro forma net income is not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  but is provided to explain the impact of certain significant items 
diluted shares for supplemental pro forma disclosures total million for the year ended december  this differs from gaap based diluted shares as it includes the dilutive impact of stock options 
they are excluded from gaap based diluted shares as we had a loss for gaap purposes and including the stock options in the calculation would be antidilutive 
years ended december  december  in thousands  except per share amounts net income loss as reported per gaap   plus impairment write down on long lived assets net of  tax benefit plus impairment write down on equity investments  plus merger related costs  net of  tax benefit  less gain on retirement of debt  net of  tax  less adjustment in accounting for taxes for costa rica subsidiary pro forma net income as adjusted   per share net income as adjusted and diluted comparison of and revenues revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in revenues primarily reflected increased demand for our products across all product lines and markets 
revenues increased    and  respectively  for our wireless communications products  telecommunications products  millimeter wave products  foundry services and saw filter products from the previous year 
domestic and international revenues were million and million  respectively  in as compared to million and million  respectively  in gross profit gross profit increased in to million from million in gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in this increase was attributable to continued improvements in production yields  increased economies of scale associated with increased sales volume and a shift of more production of saw filters to our costa rican facility 
operating expenses research  development and engineering our research  development and engineering expenses increased in to million from million in research  development and engineering expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in the increase in research  development and engineering expenses on an absolute dollar basis was primarily due to the addition of new employees  opening of our engineering design center in massachusetts and the costs associated with the development of new products 
the decrease in research  development and engineering expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to revenues increasing at a faster rate than research  development and engineering spending 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from to in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses on an absolute dollar basis was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with the ongoing development of infrastructure and business support and increased selling costs associated with the increased sales volume 
other income expense  net other income expense  net increased to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased interest income on higher cash balances offset in part by interest expense on our convertible debt 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense increased to million in from million in this increase in income tax expense was attributable to our increased profitability  as reflected by the increase in income before income taxes offset by the tax benefit of approximately million we realized from our cost rican subsidiary during our effective tax rate was in compared to in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
in addition  we had million of investments in long term marketable securities  which are investments in high grade securities that mature after one year but within eighteen months 
as of december   working capital declined to million from million as of december  the decrease in working capital was attributable to the purchases of equipment  payoff of certain operating leases  exercise of purchase option on the hillsboro facility  repurchase of a portion of the convertible subordinated notes and investments in long term marketable securities 
for  and  cash provided by operating activities was million  million and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities for was mainly due to certain non cash transactions such as depreciation and amortization  tax benefits from stock option exercises and losses due to impairments on long lived assets and equity investments and cash transactions such as decreases in accounts receivable and inventory and adjustment to conform the pooling of interest acquisition of sawtek  which was offset by net loss  extraordinary gain on repurchase of debt and increase in deferred income taxes 
for and  cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income  tax benefit from stock option exercises and depreciation and amortization offset by increases in current assets 
for  and  cash used in investing activities were million  million and million  respectively 
for  the cash used in investing activities was due to capital expenditures offset by sale maturity of marketable securities and decrease in restricted investments 
for and  cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchase of marketable securities and purchase of capital assets offset by sale maturity of marketable securities 
for  cash used in financing activities was million  which was primarily due to the repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated note and the purchase of treasury stock  which was offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock 
for and  cash provided by financing activities were million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the sale of our convertible subordinated notes 
cash provided by financing activities for was primarily due to our secondary common stock offering 
in august  we acquired our  square foot wafer fabrication facility located in richardson  texas for million 
the purchase was completed through a financing arrangement in which we contributed million and a lender contributed million 
the portion contributed by the lender is collateralized by us through pledged investment securities and appears on our balance sheet as restricted long term investments 
the portion we contributed us appears on our balance sheet as other investment 
the financing qualifies for accounting treatment as an operating lease 
we are required to either make lease payments through august or purchase the property 
if we elect to purchase the property  we will not have to pay any additional cash but rather assign the pledged securities to the lender 
we may also renew the lease for an additional four year period in august the lease is secured by the value of the property as well as the pledged investment securities 
restrictive covenants are also included in this financing arrangement which requires us to maintain a a quick ratio of not less than to  b tangible net worth not less than the sum of million and c a maximum leverage ratio not greater than 
as of december   we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants 
we are in the process of consolidating both of our texas operations into one site at the richardson facility 
we are also adding approximately  square feet of administrative and engineering office space to this facility 
we expect the move and the addition to be completed in the summer of in february and march  we completed a private placement of million net proceeds of million of convertible subordinated notes due the notes are unsecured obligations  are initially convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share and are subordinated to all of our present and future senior indebtedness 
in  we repurchased approximately million of the convertible subordinated notes due we are currently evaluating opportunities to repurchase additional portions of the debt and may from time to time repurchase portions of the debt 
we have  in prior periods  completed public offerings of our common stock in order to fund our operating and capital needs 
in addition  we have funded our operations to date through other private sales of equity  borrowings  equipment leases and cash flow from operations 
in addition  we had a revolving credit agreement totaling million from suntrust bank  central florida  na available through january  there were no borrowings against the line of credit as of december  we did not renew this line when it expired on january  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances  together with cash anticipated to be generated from operations and any financing arrangements we may enter into  will satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements and possible future acquisitions  at a minimum  through the next months 
however  we may be required to finance any additional requirements through additional equity  debt financings or credit facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financings or credit facilities  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms 
recent accounting pronouncements please see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new pronouncements 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on operating costs and expenses 
factors affecting future operating results an investment in our common stock is extremely risky 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information in this annual report on form k before investing in our common stock 
our business and the results of operations could be seriously harmed by any of the following risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose part or all of your investment 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially  which may cause our stock price to fall 
our quarterly and annual results of operations have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following cancellation or delay of customer orders or shipments  our success in achieving design wins in which our products are designed into those of our customers  market acceptance of our products and those of our customers  variability of the life cycles of our customers products  variations in manufacturing yields  timing of announcements and introduction of new products by us and our competitors  changes in the mix of products we sell  declining average sales prices for our products  ability to integrate existing and newly developed technologies  changes in manufacturing capacity and variations in the utilization of that capacity  variations in operating expenses  the long sales cycles associated with our customer specific products  the timing and level of product and process development costs  performance of vendors and subcontractors  realization of research and development efforts  variations in raw material quality and costs  delays in new process qualification or delays in transferring processes  the cyclicality of the semiconductor and electronic communications component industries  the timing and level of nonrecurring engineering revenues and expenses relating to customer specific products  and significant changes in our and our customers inventory levels 
we expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these and other factors 
any unfavorable changes in these or other factors could cause our results of operations to suffer as they have in the past 
due to potential fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
additionally  if our operating results are not within the market s expectations  then our stock price may fall 
the public stock markets have experienced  and are currently experiencing  extreme price and trading volume volatility  particularly in high technology sectors of the market 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we face continuing challenges in integrating sawtek and  as a result  may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of sawtek 
integrating the operations  systems and personnel of triquint and sawtek  as with all mergers of companies  is a complex process and we are uncertain that the integration will be completed in a timely manner or will achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 
the challenges involved in this integration include retaining existing customers and business partners of each company  retaining and integrating management and other key employees of both triquint and sawtek  coordinating research and development activities to enhance introduction of new products  services and technologies  combining product and service offerings and marketing efforts effectively and quickly  integrating and training sales forces on the expanded product and service offerings  offering integrated products and services of triquint and sawtek to each other s customers and partners  developing  maintaining and combining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and unanticipated expenses related to integration of the two companies 
we may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the merger 
the diversion of the attention of our management and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining the companies could cause the disruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of our business 
we cannot assure you that triquint and sawtek can be successfully integrated in a timely manner or at all or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized 
further  we cannot assure you that our growth rate will equal the historical growth rates of either company 
if investors or financial or industry analysts do not think our integration of sawtek is proceeding as anticipated or that the benefits of the merger are not going to be realized  the market price of our common stock may decline 
the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the merger if the integration of triquint and sawtek is not completed in a timely and efficient manner  our assumptions about sawtek s business model and operations  considered on a stand alone basis and their role in our business model  such as our ability to introduce rf front end modules incorporating components of sawtek at cost effective prices and to continue to execute its strategic plan  may prove incorrect  the effect of the merger on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts  or following the merger  our stockholders that hold relatively larger interests in our company may decide to dispose of their shares because the results of the merger are not consistent with their expectations 
our operating results may suffer if we are unable to successfully transfer our manufacturing operations from our existing dallas facility to our new richardson  texas facility 
we are transitioning our operations from our dallas  texas facility to the  square foot fabrication facility in richardson  texas we acquired in we are currently in the process of moving equipment  processes and personnel in addition to expanding the richardson facility 
given the long lead times associated with bringing a new facility to a fully qualified manufacturing production status  we will incur substantial expenses before achieving volume production in the richardson facility 
the transfer of our four inch wafer fabrication processes to the richardson facility will involve a number of significant risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  manufacturing transition  startup or process problems  construction  process qualification  or equipment delays  cost overruns or shortages of equipment or materials  any of which may also adversely affect yields 
should there be delays in commencing production at the richardson facility  we may not have adequate capacity to respond to all orders during the transition 
we produce all of our mmic products  which accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues in and which we expect to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully transition our manufacturing operations to the richardson facility prior to the expiration of our existing dallas facility s lease in july or that we will not experience difficulties in replicating critical manufacturing processes or a reduction in manufacturing output as a result 
we do not intend to extend our lease of our dallas facility 
some of our customers may have purchased quantities of our products in recent fiscal quarters in excess of their immediate needs and may continue to do so to protect themselves during the transition 
as a result  our operating results in subsequent quarters may be materially reduced 
our operating results may suffer due to fluctuations in demand for semiconductors and electronic communications components 
from time to time  the wireless phone  base station  optical network  broadband and microwave markets have experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles  capital spending cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
this cyclicality has led to significant imbalances in demand  inventory levels and production capacity 
it has also accelerated the decrease of average selling prices per unit 
we have experienced  and may experience again  periodic fluctuations in our financial results because of these or other industry wide conditions 
we expect that the current decline in demand for wireless  base station  optical network  and broadband and microwave components  including ours  could last throughout  if not longer 
for example  if demand for communications applications were to decrease substantially  demand for the integrated circuits and saw filter components in these applications would also decline  which would negatively affect our operating results 
we depend on the continued growth of communications markets 
we derive all of our product revenues from sales of products for electronic communication applications 
these markets are characterized by the following intense competition  rapid technological change  and short product life cycles  especially in the wireless market 
in the last few years  the electronic communications markets have grown rapidly  however  these markets may not continue to grow or may experience a significant slowdown  as is the current situation 
additionally  if these markets do not recover and demand for electronic communications applications continues to decline  our operating results could suffer 
products for electronic communications applications are often based on industry standards  which are continually evolving 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products based on emerging industry standards  which could render our existing products unmarketable or obsolete 
if communications markets evolve to new standards  we may be unable to successfully design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers or that will meet with substantial market acceptance 
we face risks from the failures in our manufacturing processes  the maintenance of our fabrication facilities and the processes of our vendors 
the fabrication of integrated circuits  particularly those made of gaas  is a highly complex and precise process 
our integrated circuits are currently manufactured on wafers made of gaas and sige 
our sige products are manufactured externally by atmel  our strategic partner in the development of these products 
our saw filters are currently manufactured primarily on quartz wafers 
during manufacturing  each wafer is processed to contain numerous integrated circuits or saw filters 
we may reject or be unable to sell a substantial percentage of wafers or the components on a given wafer because of minute impurities  difficulties in the fabrication process  such as failure of special equipment  operator error or power outages  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  electrical performance  wafer breakage  or other factors 
we refer to the proportion of final components that have been processed  assembled and tested relative to the gross number of components that could be constructed from the raw materials as our manufacturing yield 
compared to the manufacture of silicon integrated circuits  gaas technology is less mature and more difficult to design and manufacture within specifications in large volume 
in addition  the more brittle nature of gaas wafers can result in lower manufacturing yields than with silicon wafers 
we have in the past experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields  which have delayed product shipments and negatively impacted our results of operations 
we may experience difficulty maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
in addition  the maintenance of our fabrication facilities and our assembly facility are subject to risks  including the demands of managing and coordinating workflow between geographically separate production facilities  disruption of production in one of our facilities as a result of a slowdown or shutdown in our other facility  and higher operating costs from managing geographically separate manufacturing facilities 
we depend on certain vendors for components  equipment and services 
we maintain stringent policies regarding qualification of these vendors 
however  if these vendors processes vary in reliability or quality  they could negatively affect our products  and thereby  our results of operations 
some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas prone to natural disasters 
we have a saw manufacturing and assembly facility located in apopka  florida 
we also have an assembly facility for saw products in san jose  costa rica 
hurricanes  tropical storms  flooding  tornadoes  and other natural disasters are common events for the southeastern part of the united states and in central america 
additionally  mud slides  earthquakes and volcanic eruptions could also affect our costa rican facility 
any disruptions from these or other events would have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
though we have manufacturing and assembly capabilities for our sawtek products in both apopka and san jose  we are only capable of fabricating wafers for those products in our apopka facility 
as a result  any disruption to our apopka facility would have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
a disruption in our costa rican operations would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
operating a facility in costa rica presents risks of disruption such as government intervention  currency fluctuations  labor disputes  limited supplies of labor  power interruption or war 
any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we expect our costa rican operations to continue to account for a significant proportion of our saw operations in the future 
a change in our costa rican subsidiary s favorable tax status would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our subsidiary in costa rica operates in a free trade zone 
we expect to receive a exemption from costa rican income taxes through and a exemption through the costa rican government continues to review its policy on granting tax exemptions to companies located in free trade zones and it may change our tax status or minimize our benefit at any time 
any adverse change in the tax structure for our costa rican subsidiary made by the costa rican government would have a negative impact on our net income 
our business may be adversely affected by acts of terrorism 
acts of terrorism could interrupt or restrict our business in several ways 
we rely extensively on the use of air transportation to move our inventory to and from our vendors and to ship finished products to our customers 
if terrorist acts cause air transportation to be grounded or interrupted  our business would be similarly adversely impacted 
in addition  acts of terrorism could cause existing export regulations to be changed  which could limit the extent to which we are allowed to export our products 
to the extent that acts of terrorism also reduce customer confidence and create general economic weakness  our business would also be adversely affected 
if we fail to sell a high volume of products  our operating results will be harmed 
because large portions of our manufacturing costs are relatively fixed  our manufacturing volumes are critical to our operating results 
if we fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing volumes or experience product shipment delays  our results of operations could be harmed 
during periods of decreased demand  as we are currently experiencing  our high fixed manufacturing costs negatively effect our results of operations 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectations of future orders and these expense levels are predominantly fixed in the short term 
however  if the rate of growth of demand decreases from past levels  as we are currently experiencing  we will not be able to grow our revenue 
if we receive fewer customer orders than expected or if our customers delay or cancel orders  we may not be able to reduce our manufacturing costs in the short term and our operating results would be harmed 
if we do not sell our customer specific products in large volumes  our operating results may be harmed 
we manufacture a substantial portion of our products to address the needs of individual customers 
frequent product introductions by systems manufacturers make our future success dependent on our ability to select development projects  which will result in sufficient volumes to enable us to achieve manufacturing efficiencies 
because customer specific products are developed for unique applications  we expect that some of our current and future customer specific products may never be produced in volume and may impair our ability to cover our fixed manufacturing costs 
furthermore  if customers cancel or delay orders for these customer specific products  our inventory of these products may become unmarketable or obsolete  which would negatively affect our operating results 
in addition  if we experience delays in completing designs  if we fail to obtain development contracts from customers whose products are successful or if we fail to have our product designed into the next generation product of existing volume production customers  our revenues could be harmed 
our operating results could be harmed if we lose access to sole or limited sources of materials  equipment or services 
we currently obtain some components  equipment and services for our products from limited or single sources  such as certain ceramic and plastic packages and chemicals 
we purchase these components  equipment and services on a purchase order basis  do not carry significant inventories of components and do not have any long term supply contracts with these vendors 
our requirements are relatively small compared to silicon semiconductor manufacturers 
because we often do not account for a significant part of our vendors business  we may not have access to sufficient capacity from these vendors in periods of high demand 
if we were to change any of our sole or limited source vendors  we would be required to requalify each new vendor 
requalification could prevent or delay product shipments that could negatively affect our results of operations 
in addition  our reliance on these vendors may negatively affect our production if the components  equipment or services vary in reliability or quality 
if we are unable to obtain timely deliveries of sufficient quantities of acceptable quality or if the prices increase  our results of operations could be harmed 
our operating results could be harmed if our subcontractors and partners are unable to fulfill our requirements 
we currently utilize subcontractors for the majority of our integrated circuit assemblies 
our strategic partner  atmel  also manufactures all of our sige products 
there are certain risks associated with dependence on third party providers  such as minimal control over delivery scheduling  adequate capacity during demand peaks  warranty issues and protection of intellectual property 
additionally  if these subcontractors are unable to meet our needs  it could prevent or delay production shipments that could negatively affect our results of operations 
if we were to change any of our subcontractors  we would be required to requalify each new subcontractor  which could also prevent or delay product shipments that could negatively affect our results of operations 
in addition  our reliance on these subcontractors may negatively affect our production if the services vary in reliability or quality 
if we are unable to obtain timely service of acceptable quality or if the prices increase  our results of operations could be harmed 
if our products fail to perform or meet customer requirements  we could incur significant additional costs 
the fabrication of gaas and sige integrated circuits  saw filters and the modules containing these components is a highly complex and precise process 
our customers specify quality  performance and reliability standards that we must meet 
if our products do not meet these standards  we may be required to rework or replace the products 
gaas and sige integrated circuits and saw filters may contain undetected defects or failures that only become evident after we commence volume shipments 
we have experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems from time to time 
defects or failures may occur in the future 
if failures or defects occur  we could lose revenue  incur increased costs such as warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  experience delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products  or experience increased product returns or discounts 
our operating results may suffer as a result of the conversion of our manufacturing processes from four inch wafer production to six inch wafer production 
we have converted a portion of our existing hillsboro facility to accommodate equipment that uses six inch millimeter wafer production 
we have very limited experience processing six inch wafers in our fabrication facilities 
our inexperience may result in lower yields and higher unit production costs 
we may be required to redesign our processes and procedures substantially to accommodate the larger wafers 
as a result  converting to six inch wafer production may take longer than planned  could interrupt production of integrated circuits from four inch wafers and could harm our results of operations 
if we fail to successfully transition to six inch wafers or our manufacturing yields decline  our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
increases in our manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our operating results if the current economic downturn continues for an extended period of time 
we are currently in the process of converting our existing hillsboro facility from four inch wafer production to six inch wafer production and are expanding the capacity of our texas operations with the transition to the richardson facility 
these increases in capacity will directly relate to significant increases in fixed costs and operating expenses 
these increased costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations during the current economic downturn 
if this economic downturn were to continue for an extended period of time  the decreased levels of demand and production in conjunction with these increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may face fines or our facilities could be closed if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 
federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing process 
for our manufacturing facilities located in hillsboro  richardson  apopka and san jose  costa rica  we provide our own manufacturing waste treatment and contract for disposal of some materials 
we are required to report usage of environmentally hazardous materials 
at our dallas facility  we utilize texas instruments industrial wastewater treatment facilities and services for the pre treatment and discharge of wastewater generated by us 
our wastewater streams are commingled with those of texas instruments and are covered by texas instruments wastewater permit 
the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us and we could be required to suspend production or cease our operations 
these regulations could require us to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
we rely to a great extent on texas instruments hazardous waste disposal system at our dallas facility 
any failure by us  or by texas instruments with respect to our dallas facility  to control the use of  or to adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and harm our results of operations 
our business will be impacted if systems manufacturers do not use components made of gaas  or other alternative materials 
silicon semiconductor technologies are the dominant process technologies for integrated circuits and the performance of silicon integrated circuits continues to improve 
recently  we introduced sige components jointly developed and manufactured with atmel corporation 
although we have designed and manufactured gaas products and have begun production of sige products developed jointly and manufactured by atmel  system designers may be reluctant to adopt our products because of their unfamiliarity with designing systems with our products  their concerns related to manufacturing costs and yields  their unfamiliarity with our design and manufacturing processes  and uncertainties about the relative cost effectiveness of our products compared to high performance silicon components 
systems manufacturers may not use gaas components because the production of gaas integrated circuits has been  and continues to be  more costly than the production of silicon devices 
systems manufacturers may not use our sige components because this is a newly introduced process 
systems manufacturers may be reluctant to rely on a technology that is new to us and not widely understood 
systems manufacturers may also be reluctant to rely on a jointly produced product because future supplies may depend on the continued good relationship between atmel and us 
as a result  we must offer devices that provide superior performance to that of traditional silicon based devices 
in addition  customers may be reluctant to rely on a smaller company like us for critical components 
we cannot be certain that additional systems manufacturers will design our products into their systems or that the companies that have utilized our products will continue to do so in the future 
if our products fail to achieve market acceptance  our results of operations would suffer 
new competitive products and technologies have been announced which could reduce demand for our saw filter products 
recently  products have been introduced that may have some application in certain gsm phones  which  if proven successful  could impact sales of gsm if filters for wireless phones 
several companies recently announced a new product based on a direct conversion concept that could potentially eliminate a saw if filter in certain cdma phones 
if these products are successful in the market  it could reduce or eliminate demand for our if filters for cdma phones and our revenues would be harmed if we do not introduce competitive or alternative products 
saw if filters accounted for approximately of our revenues in any development of a cost effective and reliable technology that replaces saw filtering technology or reduces the need for saw filtering technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a decline either in the growth of wireless communications or in the continued acceptance of cdma technology would have an adverse impact on us 
our products for cdma based systems  including filters for base stations and receivers and power amplifiers for wireless phones  have accounted for approximately our revenues for cdma technology is relatively new to the marketplace and there can be no assurance that emerging markets will adopt this technology 
our business and financial results would be adversely impacted if cdma technology does not continue to gain acceptance 
our business may be adversely impacted if we fail to successfully introduce new products or to gain our customers acceptance of those new products 
the markets for electronic communications applications in which we participate are subject to intense competition  rapid technological change  and short product life cycles 
it is critical for companies such as ours to continually and quickly develop new products to meet the changing needs of these markets 
if we fail to develop new products to meet our customers needs on a timely basis  we will not be able to effectively compete in these markets 
for example  we announced our intention to develop and market rf front end modules for wireless phones at cost effective prices 
we will also need to continue to expand our wireless applications into cdma and gsm applications 
if we fail to design and produce these products in a manner acceptable to our customers or have incorrectly anticipated our customers demand for these types of products  our operating results could be harmed 
we have substantial indebtedness 
in february and march  we sold million of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers due in although we repurchased million of these notes in  we have million of indebtedness remaining 
our other indebtedness is for operating and capital leases 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on the notes and leases  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to  changes in our business  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations  including our obligation under the notes 
we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 
if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes  or our other obligations  we would be in default under the terms thereof 
default under the indenture would permit the holders of the notes to accelerate the maturity of the notes and could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we can not assure you that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes if payment of the notes were to be accelerated following the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the indenture 
customers may delay or cancel orders due to regulatory delays 
the increasing demand for electronic communications products has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for these products  generally following extensive investigation of and deliberation over competing technologies 
the delays inherent in the regulatory approval process may in the future cause the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers 
these delays have in the past had  and may in the future  have a negative effect on our sales and our results of operations 
our revenues are at risk if we do not introduce new products and or decrease costs 
historically  the average selling prices of some of our products have decreased over the products lives and we expect them to continue to do so 
to offset these decreases  we rely primarily on achieving yield improvements and other cost reductions for existing products and on introducing new products that can often be sold at higher average selling prices 
selling prices for our saw products have declined due to competitive pricing pressures and to the use of newer surface mount package devices that are smaller and less expensive than previous generation filters 
for example  we have experienced declines in average selling prices for filters for base stations due to the use of surface mount packages 
we believe our future success depends  in part  on our timely development and introduction of new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and adequately address customer requirements 
the success of new product and process introductions depends on several factors  including proper selection of products and processes  successful and timely completion of product and process development and commercialization  market acceptance of our or our customers new products  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields  and our ability to offer new products at competitive prices 
our product and process development efforts may not be successful and our new products or processes may not achieve market acceptance 
to the extent that our cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner  our results of operations could suffer 
we must improve our products and processes to remain competitive 
if technologies or standards supported by our or our customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  our results of operations may be materially impacted 
because of continual improvements in semiconductor technology  including those in high performance silicon technologies such as complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos  where substantially more resources are invested than in gaas  sige or saw products  we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to improve our product and process technologies 
we must also develop new technologies in a timely manner 
in addition  we must adapt our products and processes to technological changes and to support emerging and established industry standards 
we have and must continue to perform significant research and development into advanced material development such as inp  gallium nitride  silicon carbide and sige to compete with future technologies of our competitors 
for example  we recently announced that we have entered into an agreement with atmel to fabricate portions of our proposed sige products 
these research and development efforts may not be accepted by our customers  and therefore may not go into full production in the future 
we may not be able to improve our existing products and process technologies  develop new technologies in a timely manner or effectively support industry standards 
if we fail to do so  our customers may select another gaas  sige or saw product or move to an alternative technology 
our results of operations may suffer if we do not compete successfully 
the markets for our products are characterized by price competition  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  and heightened global competition 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical  manufacturing and marketing resources 
due to the increasing requirements for high speed  high frequency components  we expect intensified competition from existing integrated circuit and saw device suppliers  as well as from the entry of new competitors to our target markets and from their internal operations of some companies producing products similar to ours for the internal requirements 
for our integrated circuit devices  we compete primarily with both manufacturers of high performance silicon integrated circuits as well as manufacturers of gaas integrated circuits 
our silicon base competitors include companies such as applied micro circuits corporation  maxim integrated products inc  motorola  philips and stmicroelectronics nv our gaas based competitors include companies such as alpha industries inc  anadigics inc  conexant systems inc  fujitsu microelectronics  inc  infineon technologies ag  raytheon  rf micro devices and vitesse semiconductor corp 
for our saw devices our competitors include companies such as cts wireless components  micro networks  phonon  rf monolithics  vectron  epcos ag  thomson microsonics  fujitsu  murata  and toyocom 
competition could also come from companies ahead of us in developing alternative technologies such as sige and inp integrated circuits and digital filtering and direct conversion devices 
competition from existing or potential competitors may increase due to a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following offering of new or emerging technologies in integrated circuit design using alternative materials such as sige or inp  offering of new or emerging technologies such as digital filtering or direct conversion as alternatives to saw filters  mergers and acquisitions  longer operating histories and presence in key markets  development of strategic relationships  access to a wider customer base  and access to greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources 
additionally  manufacturers of high performance silicon integrated circuits have achieved greater market acceptance of their existing products and technologies in some applications 
we compete with both gaas and silicon suppliers in all of our target markets 
in microwave and millimeter wave applications  our competition is primarily from a limited number of gaas suppliers  which are in the process of expanding their product offerings to address commercial applications other than aerospace 
our prospective customers are typically systems designers and manufacturers that are considering the use of gaas or sige integrated circuits or saw filters  as the case may be  for their high performance systems 
competition is primarily based on performance elements such as speed  complexity and power dissipation  as well as price  product quality and ability to deliver products in a timely fashion 
due to the proprietary nature of our products  competition occurs almost exclusively at the system design stage 
as a result  a design win by our competitors or by us typically limits further competition with respect to manufacturing a given design 
if we fail to integrate any future acquisitions or successfully invest in privately held companies  our business will be harmed 
we face risks from any future acquisitions  including the following we may fail to merge and coordinate the operations and personnel of newly acquired companies with our existing business  additional complexity may affect our flexibility and ability to respond quickly to market and management issues  we may experience difficulties integrating our financial and operating systems  we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning  treasury management and financial reporting  our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention  we may not cost effectively and rapidly incorporate the technologies we acquire  we may not be able to recognize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated  we may not be able to retain the existing customers of newly acquired operations  our corporate culture may clash with that of the acquired businesses  and we may incur unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
we face risks from equity investments in privately held companies  such as we may not realize the expected benefits associated with the investment  we may need to provide additional funding to support the privately held company  or if their value decreases  we may realize losses on our holdings 
we may not successfully address these risks or any other problems that arise in connection with future acquisitions or equity investments in privately held companies 
we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and we may pursue product  technology or business acquisitions or investments in strategic partners 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities that could dilute the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders  we may incur additional debt and we may be required to amortize expenses related to other intangible assets or record impairment of goodwill that may negatively affect our results of operations 
if we do not hire and retain key employees  our business will suffer 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical  marketing and management personnel 
we also depend on our ability to continue to identify  attract and retain qualified technical employees  particularly highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the manufacture and development of our products and processes 
we must also recruit and train employees to manufacture our products without a substantial reduction in manufacturing yields 
there are many other semiconductor companies located in the communities near our facilities and it may become increasingly difficult for us to attract and retain those employees 
the competition for these employees is intense  and the loss of key employees could negatively affect us 
our business may be harmed if we fail to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we currently have patents granted and pending in the united states and elsewhere and intend to seek further international and united states patents on our technology 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold or that any claims allowed from pending applications or will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
our ability to produce our products may suffer if someone claims we infringe on their intellectual property 
the integrated circuit and saw device industries are characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
if it is necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot be certain that licenses will be offered or that we would find the terms of licenses that are offered acceptable or commercially reasonable 
our failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation by or against us could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management  whether or not the litigation results in a favorable determination 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  indemnify our customers  stop the manufacture  use and sale of the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes  or obtain licenses to the technology 
we may be unsuccessful in developing non infringing products or negotiating licenses upon reasonable terms  or at all 
these problems might not be resolved in time to avoid harming our results of operations 
if any third party makes a successful claim against our customers or us and a license is not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms  our business could be harmed 
our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales 
our sales outside of the united states were of revenues in and of revenues in we face inherent risks from these sales  including imposition of government controls  currency exchange fluctuations  longer payment cycles and difficulties related to the collection of receivables from international customers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  unfavorable tax consequences  difficulty obtaining distribution and support  political instability  and tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  due to the technological advantages provided by gaas integrated circuits in many military applications  the office of export administration of the us department of commerce must license all of our sales outside of north america 
we are also required to obtain licenses from that agency for sales of our saw products to customers in certain countries 
if we fail to obtain these licenses or experience delays in obtaining these licenses in the future  our results of operations could be harmed 
also  because all of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  increases in the value of the dollar would increase the price in local currencies of our products and make our products less price competitive 
we may be subject to a securities class action suit if our stock price falls 
following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  some stockholders may file securities class action litigation 
for example  in  a stockholder class action lawsuit was filed against us  our underwriters and some of our officers  directors and investors  which alleged that we  our underwriters and certain of our officers  directors and investors intentionally misled the investing public regarding our financial prospects 
we settled the action and recorded a special charge of million associated with the settlement of this lawsuit and related legal expenses  net of accruals  in any future securities class action litigation could be expensive and divert our management s attention and harm our business  regardless of its merits 
our stock will likely be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control and may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of semiconductor companies have been especially volatile 
the market price of our common stock may experience significant fluctuations in the future 
for example  our common stock price has fluctuated from a high of approximately to a low of approximately during the weeks ended december  this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in response  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include anti takeover provisions  which may deter or prevent a takeover attempt 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt  including a takeover that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock 
these provisions include cumulative voting 
our stockholders are entitled to cumulate their votes for directors 
this may limit the ability of the stockholders to remove a director other than for cause 
stockholder proposals and nominations 
our stockholders must give advance notice  generally days prior to the relevant meeting  to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to our stockholders at a meeting 
these notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying stockholder action 
stockholder rights plan 
we may trigger our stockholder rights plan in the event our board of directors does not agree to an acquisition proposal 
the rights plan may make it more difficult and costly to acquire our company 
preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine what rights  preferences and privileges such shares have 
no action by our stockholders is necessary before our board of directors can issue the preferred stock 
our board of directors could use the preferred stock to make it more difficult and costly to acquire our company 
delaware anti takeover statute 
the delaware anti takeover law restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires or more of our common stock 
the delaware statute makes it harder for our company to be acquired without the consent of our board of directors and management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to minimal market risks 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment policy which allows only high rated securities 
our investments  both restricted and unrestricted  are classified as available for sale securities and are comprised of highly rated  short and medium term investments  such as us government agencies  corporate debt securities and other such low risk investments 
although we manage investments under an investment policy  economic  market and other events may occur to our investees  which we cannot control 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are exposed to currency exchange fluctuations  as we sell our products internationally and have an operation in costa rica 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales  purchases of raw materials and equipment and our costa rican operations by denominating most transactions in us dollars 
we do engage in limited foreign currency hedging transactions  principally to lock in the cost of purchase commitments that are not denominated in us dollars 
at december   we had no open commitments to purchase foreign currency 
our convertible subordinated notes due have a fixed interest rate of 
consequently  we do not have significant cash flow exposure on our long term debt 
however  the fair value of the convertible subordinated notes is subject to significant fluctuations due to their convertibility into shares of our stock and other market conditions 
the following table shows the fair values of our investments and convertible subordinated notes as of december  in thousands carrying value fair value cash and cash equivalents   available for sale investments including unrealized gains of convertible subordinated notes   we are exposed to interest rate risk  if we use additional financing to fund capital expenditures 
the interest rate that we may be able to obtain on financings will depend on market conditions at that time and may differ from the rates we have secured in the past
