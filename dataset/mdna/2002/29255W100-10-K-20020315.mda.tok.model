item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note regarding forward looking statements our disclosure and analysis in this report contains some forward looking statements 
forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
these statements may include words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
in particular  these include  among other things  statements relating to amount  nature  and timing of capital expenditures  drilling of wells  timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas  increases in proved reserves  operating costs and other expenses  cash flow and anticipated liquidity  prospect exploitation and property acquisitions  and marketing of oil and natural gas 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this report may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors mentioned in our discussion in this report would be important in determining future results 
actual future results may vary materially 
factors that could cause our results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements include the following the risks associated with operating in one or two major geographic areas  the risks associated with drilling of oil and natural gas wells in our exploitation efforts  our ability to find  acquire  market  develop  and produce new properties  oil and natural gas price volatility  uncertainties in the estimation of proved reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and timing of exploitation expenditures  operating hazards attendant to the oil and natural gas business  drilling and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance  potential mechanical failure or underperformance of significant wells  climatic conditions  availability and cost of material and equipment  actions or inactions of third party operators of our properties  our ability to find and retain skilled personnel  availability of capital  the strength and financial resources of our competitors  regulatory developments  environmental risks  and general economic conditions 
when you consider these forward looking statements  you should keep in mind these risk factors and the other cautionary statements in this report 
description of critical accounting policies oil and natural gas properties we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all development and acquisition costs of proved properties are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves or proved reserves  as applicable 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined to be unsuccessful 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance to sustain or increase production from the existing producing reservoir are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures to recomplete a current well in a different or additional proven or unproven reservoir are capitalized pending determination that economic reserves have been added 
if the recompletion is not successful  the expenditures are charged to expense 
expenditures for redrilling or directional drilling in a previously abandoned well are classified as drilling costs to a proven or unproven reservoir for determination of capital or expense 
significant tangible equipment added or replaced is capitalized 
expenditures to construct facilities or increase the productive capacity from existing reserves are capitalized 
internal costs directly associated with the development and exploitation of properties are capitalized as a cost of the property and are classified accordingly in the company s financial statements 
natural gas volumes are converted to equivalent barrels at the rate of six mcf to one barrel 
the company is required to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties and other long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the asset s carrying value to its undiscounted expected future net cash flows  then it is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depletion  depreciation  and amortization dd a to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of management judgment  including the determination of property s reserves  future cash flows  and fair value 
management s assumptions used in calculating oil and natural gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded  reducing our net income and our basis in the related asset 
future prices received for production and future production costs may vary  perhaps significantly  from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of calculating reserve estimates 
there can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be developed within the periods estimated or that prices and costs will remain constant 
actual production may not equal the estimated amounts used in the preparation of reserve projections 
as these estimates change  the amount of calculated reserves change 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
additionally  as management s views related to future prices change  this changes the calculation of future net cash flows and also affects fair value estimates 
changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment 
dd a expense is also directly affected by the company s reserve estimates 
any change in reserves directly impacts the amount of dd a expense the company recognizes in a given period 
assuming no other changes  such as an increase in depreciable base  as the company s reserves increase  the amount of dd a expense in a given period decreases and vice versa 
changes in future commodity prices would likely result in increases or decreases in estimated recoverable reserves 
bad debt expense the company routinely assesses the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility 
the company historically has not required collateral or other performance guarantees from creditworthy counterparties 
many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on property of which we are the operator 
thus  we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to cover any non payment of joint interest billings 
our oil and natural gas receivables quickly turnover  usually one month for oil and two months for gas  thus  signaling any problem accounts in a timely manner 
counterparties to our derivative commodity and interest rate contracts are routinely reviewed for creditworthiness to determine the realizability of any related derivative assets we might carry on our books 
this review of receivables and counterparties is heavily dependent on the judgment of management 
if it is determined that the carrying value of a receivable or financial instrument might not be recoverable  we record an allowance to the extent we believe the receivable or asset is not recoverable 
the determination as to what extent a receivable or asset might be impaired is also heavily dependent on the judgment of management 
as more information becomes known related to a particular counterparty or customer  management will continually reassess previous judgments and any resulting change in the related allowance could have a material positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period of the change 
hedging and related activities we use various financial instruments for non trading purposes in the normal course of our business to manage and reduce price volatility and other market risks associated with our crude oil and natural gas production 
this activity is referred to as hedging 
these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to commodity price decreases  but they can also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from commodity price increases 
our risk management activity is generally accomplished through over the counter forward derivative contracts executed with large financial institutions 
prior to january   these agreements were accounted for as hedges using the deferral method of accounting 
unrealized gains and losses were generally not recognized until the physical production required by the contracts was delivered 
at the time of delivery  the resulting gains and losses were recognized as an adjustment to oil and natural gas revenues 
the cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges were reported as cash flows from operations 
if the hedge was terminated prior to maturity  gains or losses were deferred and included in income in the same period as the physical production required by the contracts was delivered 
we also use derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps  which hedge our risk related to interest rate fluctuation 
prior to january   these agreements were accounted for as hedges using the accrual method of accounting 
the differences to be paid or received on swaps designated as hedges were included in interest expense during the period to which the payment or receipt related 
the cash flows related to recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges were reported as cash flows from operations 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires us to recognize all of our derivative and hedging instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and measure them at fair value 
if a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting  it must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
however  if a derivative does qualify for hedge accounting  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value can be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  the cash flows from the hedging instrument must be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows due to changes in the underlying items being hedged 
in addition  all hedging relationships must be designated  documented  and reassessed periodically 
most of the company s derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
the only exceptions at december  are two written oil put contracts representing  bbls d for sold to finance the purchase of oil collar contracts 
additionally  another oil put contract representing bbls d was written in february to finance the purchase of another oil collar contract 
according to the provisions of sfas  these are marked to market through earnings each quarter 
if oil prices were to change dramatically and cause a material increase or decrease in the market value of these contracts  the change would be recognized in earnings immediately 
currently  all of the company s derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges 
these instruments hedge the exposure of variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized into earnings immediately 
while management does not anticipate changing the destination of any of our current derivative contracts as hedges  factors beyond our control could preclude the use of hedge accounting 
one example would be variability in the nymex price for oil or natural gas  upon which many of our commodity derivative contracts are based  that does not coincide with changes in the spot price for oil and natural gas that we are paid 
another example would be if the counterparty to a derivative contract was no longer deemed creditworthy and non performance under the terms of the contract was likely  see bad debt expense for discussion of management judgments as it relates to asset realizability 
if any of our contracts no longer qualify for hedge accounting  this could potentially induce high earnings volatility  as any future changes in the market value of the contract would then be marked to market through earnings 
net profits interests a major portion of our acreage in cca is subject to net profits interests ranging from to 
the holders of these net profits interests are entitled to receive a fixed percentage of the cash flow remaining after specified costs have been deducted from revenue 
the net profits calculations are contractually defined and complex  but generally provide that net profits are to be determined after considering operating expense  overhead expense  interest expense  and developmental drilling costs 
these net profits interests are reflected in our reserve reports as estimated future production costs and in our financial statements as a reduction in revenues 
the impact of future net profits interests on our financial statements may vary significantly from period to period due to changes in commodity prices and or developmental drilling activity 
comparison of to set forth below is our comparison of operations during the year ended december  with the year ended december  revenues and production 
for the year ended december   revenues increased million 
the following table illustrates the primary components of oil and natural gas revenue for the years ended december  and  as well as each year s respective oil and natural gas volumes in thousands except per unit amounts year ended december  difference revenues revenue unit revenue unit revenue bbl oil wellhead    net profits oil    oil hedges    total oil revenues    natural gas wellhead    net profits gas natural gas hedges   total gas revenues    nymex nymex nymex other data production unit production unit production unit oil bbls   natural gas mcf    oil revenues increased million from to as illustrated above  this was due to an increase in oil volumes offset somewhat by a slight decrease in net price per barrel 
oil volumes increased mbbls from to due to a full year of production from the acquisitions completed during  as well as increased production from the company s successful development drilling program 
however  total wellhead oil revenues decreased million due to a decrease of per bbl in the price received 
this resulted primarily from a decrease in the overall market price for oil in as reflected in the per bbl decrease in the average nymex price from to the decrease in wellhead oil revenues was offset by a decrease in payments made for net profits and hedging  which decreased million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net profits was primarily due to increased drilling in the company s cca property 
capital expenditures for drilling and development are a large component of the net profits interest on the cca  the costs of which are deducted in calculating net profits payments 
capital expenditures for the cca increased in to million  versus million for the company s hedging activities are not a component of the expenses deducted in calculating net profits interest payments 
the decrease in hedging payments is a direct result of the decrease in the average nymex price for oil 
natural gas revenues increased from to by million due to a  mmcf increase in production  while net price received remained relatively flat 
the increase in volumes is due to a full year of production for the acquisitions completed in  as well as increased production in the cca and crockett county properties due to successful development drilling 
wellhead price received decreased per mcf  while the average nymex price increased per mcf 
this is the result of higher prices received in relation to nymex for natural gas in the cca versus the price discount received in the indian basin verden areas 
net profits payments related to gas decreased per mcf due to increased drilling in the cedar creek anticline  while hedging payments decreased per mcf due to different hedges being in effect during than for the increased production related to our anticipated million capital drilling program and the permian basin acquisition  which together we forecast to add an average of  boe per day for the year 
this should help counteract the sharp decline curve we expect on our lodgepole property 
unless changes are made to our planned drilling activities  another acquisition is made  or lodgepole performs differently than expected  production should average approximately  boe d for prices received for oil and natural gas production is largely based on current market prices  which are beyond our control 
during  prices were trending downward 
the average nymex prices of per bbl and per mcf in were significantly higher than the month forward strip prices at december  of per bbl and per mcf 
we feel that oil prices will rebound somewhat in from their december  projected levels 
thus  we have based our forecasts on the assumptions of per bbl and per mcf nymex prices 
at these assumed prices  we have forecasted hedging payments of approximately million for oil and receipts of million for natural gas 
however  these amounts will change directly with any change in the market price of oil and natural gas and with any change in our outstanding hedge positions 
additionally  we have anticipated net profits payments of million for oil and million for natural gas 
these payments are highly dependent on the level of drilling in the cca and commodity prices  and thus  any change in the level of drilling or market fluctuation in commodity prices will have a direct impact on the amount of payments we are required to make 
if commodity prices are significantly lower than our forecasted prices of for oil and for natural gas  the company will not be able to fund the budgeted million drilling program for through internally generated cash flows 
in this case  the company would have to borrow money  seek additional equity  or curtail the capital program 
if drilling is curtailed or ended  future cash flows will be materially negatively impacted 
direct lifting costs 
direct lifting costs of the company for the year ended december  increased as compared to by million 
the increase in direct lifting costs resulted from the increase in volumes related to the full year effect of our acquisitions and our successful drilling program  as well as an increase in direct lifting costs per boe 
see revenues and production 
on a per boe basis  direct lifting costs increased from in to in due to higher workover and contract labor costs in the cca resulting from to the relatively harsh winter and the increased cost for services 
additionally  the company incurred million related to workovers in bell creek  which was acquired in december for we anticipate an increase in total direct lifting costs  as well as on a per boe basis 
the overall increase in total is directly related to our permian basin acquisition  which closed on january   as well as an increase in insurance rates on our wells caused by industry wide insurance losses sustained in on a per boe basis  we anticipate higher direct lifting costs primarily from higher per boe costs associated with our permian basin acquisition 
we have projected total direct lifting costs of approximately million or per boe for production  ad valorem  and severance taxes 
production  ad valorem  and severance taxes for the year ended december  decreased as compared to by approximately million 
as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effects of hedges  production  ad valorem  and severance taxes decreased from to from to this decrease was the result of a higher production  ad valorem  and severance tax rate in montana associated with our cca asset versus the lower tax rates in texas  north dakota  new mexico  and oklahoma associated with our crockett county  lodgepole  and indian basin verden assets 
thus  as the percentage of revenue from crockett county  lodgepole  and indian basin verden increased in  the total production  ad valorem  and severance tax rate for all areas declined 
for we believe total production  ad valorem  and severance taxes will increase overall due to the permian basin acquisition 
however  the production  ad valorem  and severance tax rate should remain relatively constant at an estimated of wellhead revenues 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization dd a expense 
dd a expense increased by approximately million from to this increase was due to a mmboe increase in production volumes  as well as an increase in the dd a rate per boe 
see revenues and production 
the average dd a rate increased from per boe of production during to per boe in the increase in volumes caused a million increase in related dd a expense  while the increased dd a rate caused a million increase 
the higher rate in is attributable to higher per boe acquisition costs associated with the crockett county  lodgepole  indian basin verden  and bell creek acquisitions completed in as compared to the original rate associated with the cedar creek anticline 
we anticipate the total dd a expense in to increase due to increased production resulting from the million permian basin acquisition and our planned capital expenditures of million 
assuming capital expenditures that do not differ significantly from our budgeted amount  our dd a rate for should approximate per boe 
this decrease from primarily reflects a decrease in anticipated production from some of our higher per boe rate properties 
this rate could vary significantly based on actual capital expenditures  production rates  and any acquisition that closes in additionally  changes in the market price for oil and natural gas could affect the level of our reserves 
as the level of reserves change  the dd a rate is inversely affected 
general and administrative g a expense 
g a expense increased million from to excluding non cash stock based compensation of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in g a resulted from the additional staff and lease space necessary for the crockett county  lodgepole  indian basin verden  and bell creek acquisitions completed in during  the company leased an additional floor at the corporate headquarters and incurred additional costs related to being a publicly traded company 
on a per boe basis  g a expense fell to during from during this reduction resulted as fixed costs were spread over a greater amount of production in as compared to we have forecasted approximately million for general and administrative expenses in this represents a modest increase from the increase will result from hiring additional staff necessary after the permian basin acquisition and hiring additional staff necessary to evaluate potential acquisitions in a year that we expect to see many quality oil and natural gas properties on the market 
other operating expense 
the company recorded million of other operating expense in with no similar amount in this amount primarily consists of severance payments made during or accrued at december  to former employees of the company  as well as transportation costs  namely pipeline fees paid to third parties 
additionally  geological and geophysical and delay rentals are recorded on this line in the income statement 
for  we anticipate other operating expense to be approximately to million 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million from to the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from the pay down of debt in conjunction with the company s initial public offering 
in addition  the weighted average interest rate  including hedges  for was compared to for the following table illustrates the components of interest expense for and in thousands difference facility    burlington note hedges fees total    non cash stock based compensation expense 
non cash stock based compensation expense decreased from million for to million for this non cash stock based compensation expense is associated with the purchase by our management stockholders of class a common stock under our management stock plan adopted in august and was recorded as compensation in accordance with variable plan accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
the million of non cash compensation expense was recorded in the first quarter of and represents the final amount of expense to be recorded related to the class a stock 
the company does not expect to incur any additional expense associated with non cash stock based compensation related to the company s employees 
derivative fair value loss 
the derivative fair value loss of million in represents the ineffective portion of the mark to market loss on our derivative hedging instruments  as well as the mark to market loss on our two short puts outstanding at december  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price sensitivity 
these amounts are now being recorded as required by statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
see description of critical accounting policies 
no similar amounts were recorded in as we adopted sfas effective january  currently this line item on the income statement is primarily dependent on the futures price of oil 
this is due to the fact that  currently  the main component is the mark to market movement of our two short oil puts 
the unrealized loss related to these two written option contracts at december  that has been recognized in earnings was million 
additionally  we wrote another put contract representing bbls d of oil in february to finance the purchase of another oil collar contract 
since these contracts move in conjunction with the futures price of oil  if the price of oil moves down  we will recognize a loss and if it moves up we will recognize a gain 
as the market price of oil continually changes  we cannot reliably estimate the mark to market value of these puts in the future 
bad debt expense 
on december   enron corp 
and certain subsidiaries  including enron north america corp 
enron  each filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of title of the united states bankruptcy code 
prior to this date  the company had entered into oil and natural gas hedging contracts with enron  many of which were set to expire at december   however  others related to and as a result of the chapter bankruptcy declaration and pursuant to the terms of the company s contract with enron  we terminated all outstanding oil and natural gas derivative contracts with enron as of december  according to the terms of the contract  enron is liable to the company for the mark to market value of all contracts outstanding on that date  which totaled million 
additionally  enron failed to make timely payment of million in hedge settlements 
both of these amounts remained outstanding as of december  due to the uncertainty of future collection of any or all of the amounts owed to us by enron  for the year ended december   we have recorded a charge to bad debt expense for the full amount of the receivable  million  and recorded a related allowance on the receivable of million 
any ultimate recovery on the enron receivable will be recognized in earnings when management believes recovery of the asset is probable 
at the time of termination  the market price of our commodity contracts with enron exceeded their amortized cost on our balance sheet  giving rise to a gain 
according to the provisions of sfas  this gain must be recorded in other comprehensive income until such time as the original hedged production affects income 
as a result  at december   we had million in gross unrecognized gains in other comprehensive income that will be reversed into earnings during and the following table illustrates the future amortization of this amount to revenue in thousands period oil gas total total    impairment of oil and gas properties 
throughout  futures prices for oil and natural gas continued to decline from their december  levels 
the sec price case used for our reserve estimate was per bbl and per mcf dropping to per bbl and per mcf for the estimate 
although the sec price case does not necessarily coincide with management s estimates of future prices  this indicated the need to assess our oil and natural gas properties for any possible impairment 
thus  we compared the undiscounted future cash flows for each of our oil and natural gas properties to their net book value  which indicated the need for an impairment charge on certain properties 
we then compared the net book value of the impaired assets to their estimated fair value  which resulted in a write down of the value of proved oil and gas properties of million 
fair value was determined using estimates of future production volumes and estimates of future prices we might receive for these volumes discounted back to a present value using a rate commensurate with the risks inherent in the industry 
future impairment charges could result based on changes in the company s estimated reserves  management s estimate of future prices  or management s fair value estimate of our properties 
if oil and natural gas prices were to decrease in the future  our reserves could be negatively impacted and or management s estimate of either future cash flows or fair value of our properties could change 
any of these results could indicate the need for additional impairment charges 
comparison of to set forth below is our comparison of operations during the year ended december  with the year ended december  in reading the comparison  the period included twelve months of operations while the period included only seven months of operating activities 
accordingly  operations in the two accounting periods are not directly comparable 
revenues 
oil and natural gas revenues of the company for increased as compared to by million  from million to million 
this increase resulted from the additional five months of production from the cca properties acquired in june  as well as the crockett county and lodgepole acquisitions completed in april the indian basin verden acquisition includes four months of production for the bell creek acquisition accounted for one month of production for during the fourth quarter of  an unusually severe winter storm briefly disrupted our operation of the cca properties 
the disruption in operations resulted in a loss of production of approximately mboe or million of associated revenue 
also  the indian basin gas plant was off line for one time modifications in the fourth quarter of that disruption in operations resulted in loss of production of mboe or million of revenue 
hedging transactions had the effect of reducing oil and natural gas revenues by million  or per boe  during and decreasing oil and natural gas revenues by million  or per boe  during net profits interest payments had the effect of reducing oil and natural gas revenues by million  or per boe  during and decreasing oil and natural gas revenues by million or per boe  during on a pro forma basis  the company s revenues and production volumes for the year ended december  would have been million and mmboe 
direct lifting costs 
direct lifting costs of the company for the year ended december  increased as compared to by million  from million to million 
the increase in direct lifting costs resulted from the cca acquisition completed in june  as well as the crockett county  lodgepole  indian basin verden and bell creek acquisitions completed in on a per boe basis  direct lifting costs decreased from to  primarily as a result of lower lifting costs associated with our lodgepole acquisition in april because of the winter storm in the fourth quarter of at our cca properties  direct lifting costs included million  or per boe for the year  of expenses associated with repairing equipment and bringing production back on line 
on a pro forma basis  the company s direct lifting costs for the year ended december  would have been million  or per boe 
production  ad valorem  and severance taxes 
production  ad valorem  and severance taxes for the year ended december  increased as compared to by approximately million  from million to million 
the increase in production  ad valorem  and severance taxes resulted from the cca acquisition completed in june  as well as the crockett county  lodgepole  indian basin verden and bell creek acquisitions completed in as a percent of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effects of hedges  production  ad valorem  and severance taxes decreased from to 
the decrease in production  ad valorem  and severance taxes as a percent of revenue was a result of the higher production  ad valorem  and severance tax rate in montana associated with our cca asset versus the tax rates in texas and north dakota associated with our crockett county and lodgepole assets  respectively 
on a pro forma basis  the company s production  ad valorem  and severance taxes for would have been million  or per boe

non cash stock based compensation expense 
the company has recorded million of non cash stock based compensation associated with the purchase by our management stockholders of class a common stock under our management stock plan adopted in august this amount represents the vested portion of the shares purchased and is recorded as compensation  based on of the anticipated price per share associated with our initial public offering  calculated in accordance with variable plan accounting under apb interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense resulted from the additional borrowing necessary under the company s credit agreement for the cca acquisition completed in june  as well as the crockett county acquisition completed in april  the indian basin verden acquisition completed in august and the bell creek acquisition completed in november additional interest expense during the first nine months of resulted from a seller financed note from burlington resources oil gas 
the note requires monthly principal payments and interest on the outstanding principal paid at maturity of the note in january on a pro forma basis  the company s interest expense for the year ended december  would have been million  or per boe 
liquidity and capital resources principal uses of capital have been for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operations was million  an increase of million compared to we anticipate that our capital expenditures will total approximately million for not including the million permian basin acquisition that closed in january the level of these and other future expenditures is largely discretionary  and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly  depending on available opportunities and market conditions 
we plan to finance our ongoing development and acquisition expenditures using internally generated cash flow  available cash  and our existing credit agreement 
at december   the company had total assets of million 
total capitalization was million  of which was represented by stockholders equity and by senior debt 
the company s operating subsidiary currently maintains a credit agreement with a group of banks that matures in may the company has guaranteed the subsidiary s obligations under the credit agreement and has pledged the stock and other equity interests of its subsidiaries to secure the guaranty 
borrowings under the credit agreement totaled million as of december  the borrowing base  as established in the credit agreement  was million as of december  during  the weighted average interest rate under the facility was 
the remaining borrowing base available under the credit agreement at december   was million 
we pay certain fees based on the unused portion of the borrowing base 
we financed the million permian basin acquisition  which closed on january   with available borrowings under the credit agreement 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement at february  were million  which gave us remaining borrowing capacity of million as of that date 
the borrowing base is to be redetermined each june the company and the bank syndicate each have the ability to request one additional borrowing base redetermination per year 
if amounts outstanding ever exceed the borrowing base  the company must reduce the amounts outstanding to the redetermined borrowing base within six months 
the credit agreement contains a number of negative and financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all of them as of december  the most important of these covenants are a prohibition against incurring debt in excess of million  except for borrowings under the credit agreement and the seller financing note described below  a prohibition against paying dividends or purchasing or redeeming capital stock  a restriction on creating liens on the company s assets  restrictions on merging and selling assets outside the ordinary course of business  restrictions on investments  transactions with affiliates  changing the company s principal business and incurring funding obligations under erisa  a provision limiting oil and natural gas hedging transactions to a volume not exceeding of anticipated production from proved reserves  and a requirement that we maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of not less than to the company issued a million note payable to burlington resources in connection with the lodgepole acquisition in north dakota 
the note required monthly principal payments over the month period ending january  the note bore monthly compounded interest at the rate of per annum on the outstanding principal plus accrued interest and was payable at maturity in january principal payments through december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
the remaining principal balance of million was paid in january  along with accrued interest  which at december  totaled million 
the company believes that its capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of its business 
based on our anticipated capital investment programs  we expect to invest our internally generated cash flow to replace production and enhance our waterflood programs 
additional capital may be required to pursue acquisitions and longer term capital projects  such as our proposed high pressure air injection tertiary recovery project in the cca  to increase our reserve base 
substantially all of these expenditures are discretionary and will be undertaken only if funds are available and the projected rates of return are satisfactory 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices 
operations and other capital resources may not provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures 
the following table illustrates the company s contractual obligations outstanding at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt   note payable   operating leases    totals     inflation and changes in prices while the general level of inflation affects certain of our costs  factors unique to the petroleum industry result in independent price fluctuations 
historically  significant fluctuations have occurred in oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  changing prices often cause costs of equipment and supplies to vary as industry activity levels increase and decrease to reflect perceptions of future price levels 
although it is difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas  price fluctuations have had  and will continue to have  a material effect on us

we have adopted a formal hedging policy 
the purpose of our hedging program is to mitigate the negative effects of declining commodity prices on our business 
the hedging policy is set by the executive vice president of business development with input from the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer 
trades are executed by the executive vice president of business development 
the treasury department handles the administration functions  which entail tracking existing trades  confirming new trades  and conducting monthly settlements 
our accounting department records the transactions in the financial statements 
we plan to continue in the normal course of business to hedge our exposure to fluctuating commodity prices 
these arrangements will not exceed of anticipated production from proved producing reserves 
currently  for the first six months of  we have approximately of our oil production placed in floors  capped  and in swap agreements and for the last six months of  we have approximately of our estimated oil production in floors  capped  and in swap agreements 
in addition  for  we have approximately of our estimated natural gas placed in floors  capped  and in swap agreements and for we have approximately of our estimated natural gas production in swap agreements 
our hedging policy does not permit us to engage in hedging transactions for speculation for our own account 
counterparties 
the company s counterparties to hedging contracts include bank of america  a commercial bank  j 
aron  a wholly owned subsidiary of goldman  sachs co 
and a commodities trading firm  and cibc world markets cibc  the marketing arm of the canadian imperial bank of commerce 
as of december   approximately   and of hedged oil production is committed to j 
aron  bank of america  and cibc  respectively 
all of our hedged natural gas production is contracted with j 
aron 
performance on all of j 
aron s contracts with the company is guaranteed by their parent goldman  sachs co 
as of december   we have terminated all of our oil and natural gas contracts with enron north america corp 
see item comparison of to bad debt expense 
we feel the credit worthiness of our current counterparties is sound and do not anticipate any non performance of contractual obligations 
however  as long as a counterparty maintains an investment grade credit rating  pursuant to our hedging contracts  no collateral is required 
commodity price sensitivity 
the tables in this section provide information about derivative financial instruments to which we were a party as of december  that are sensitive to changes in oil and natural gas commodity prices 
no instrument provides the option to roll the contract forward rather than make or take delivery 
the company hedges commodity price risk with swap contracts  put contracts  and collar contracts 
swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes 
put contracts provide a fixed floor price on a notional amount of sales volumes while allowing full price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price 
collar contracts provide a floor price on a notional amount of sales volumes while allowing some additional price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price 
additionally  we occasionally finance the purchase of collar contracts through the short sale of put contracts with a strike price well below the floor price of the collar 
these short put contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas  and accordingly  the mark to market change in the value of these contracts is recorded as fair value gain loss in the income statement 
at december   we had two such contracts in place representing  bbls d with a strike price of per barrel 
additionally  we sold another put contract short representing bbls d of oil in february to finance the purchase of an oil collar contract 
the unrealized mark to market gain on our outstanding commodity derivatives at december  was approximately million 
the fair market value of our oil hedging contracts was million and the fair market value of our gas hedging contracts was million 
at december   the fair value liability of the company s two written put contracts was million

interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the company had total debt of million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the remaining outstanding debt balance of million is under our credit agreement  which is subject to floating market rates of interest 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to libor or the prime rate  at our option 
any increase in these rates can have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations and cash flow 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of our floating rate debt 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps as follows fair market notional value at swap amount libor december  in thousands start date end date swap rate in thousands  december  march    november  november  glossary of oil and natural gas terms the following are abbreviations and definitions of certain terms commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and this report acquisition and development costs
