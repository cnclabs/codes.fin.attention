the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements relating to our anticipated future financial condition and operating results and our current business plans 
these forward looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this report 
while we believe any forward looking statements we have made are reasonable  actual results could differ materially since the statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties are detailed elsewhere in this report and from time to time in other reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission

overview we are a leading provider of medical professional liability insurance coverage  writing this coverage in states throughout the country 
this insurance coverage protects physicians and other health providers from claims filed against them for alleged acts of medical malpractice 
medical professional liability insurance represented of our direct premiums written in in addition  we write workers compensation insurance in states  insuring a variety of business classes 
during  we also provided a limited amount of general personal and commercial coverage and participated in a health insurance program 
our policy liability limits vary by line and state 
in workers compensation insurance  state statutes dictate the coverage we offer our policyholders 
for medical professional liability insurance  most states allow physicians to choose their own coverage limits 
the limits of liability purchased by our medical professional liability policyholders differ by state 
in michigan and new mexico  the most common limits purchased by our policyholders are  per claim  with a  annual aggregate 
in florida  the most common limits purchased is  in all other states  the most common limit purchased is  per claim  with an  annual aggregate 
higher limits and excess coverage may be written in conjunction with special reinsurance arrangements 
we purchase reinsurance to limit risk on our individual exposures  stabilize underwriting results and increase our capacity to write insurance 
by purchasing reinsurance  we transfer a portion of our loss exposure to a reinsurer 
purchasing reinsurance does not discharge us from our obligation to our insureds 
if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations  we remain liable to pay the insured 
we have various reinsurance agreements in place 
in general  we retain the first  of a claim  reinsurers pay amounts in excess of  per claim 
we annually review the financial stability of all of our reinsurers 
this review includes a ratings analysis of each reinsurer participating in a reinsurance contract 
on the basis of this review  as of december   we concluded that there was no material risk of not being paid by our reinsurers 
we have not experienced any material difficulties in collecting amounts due from reinsurers 
we believe that our reinsurance is maintained with financially stable reinsurers and that any reinsurance security we have is adequate to protect our interests 
however  our inability to collect on our reinsurance  or the inability of our reinsurers to make payments under the terms of reinsurance  due to insolvency or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
the following policies are those we believe to be the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are actuarially estimated using the company s claim experience 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency 
when a claim is reported to us  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
this estimate reflects an informed judgment based upon insurance reserving practices appropriate for the relevant line of business  and on the experience and knowledge of the estimator regarding the nature and value of the specific claim  the severity of injury or damage  and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
case reserves are periodically adjusted by the claims staff  as more information becomes available 
the estimation of ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process and does not represent an exact calculation of that liability 
we do not discount our reserves to recognize the time value of money 
we maintain reserves for claims incurred but not reported to provide for future reporting of already incurred claims and developments on reported claims 
the reserve for claims incurred but not reported is determined based on historical loss trends 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate 
the methodology for making such estimates and establishing the resulting liabilities is continually reviewed  and any adjustments are reflected as an expense in the period in which the adjustment is made 
investments 
investments represent our largest asset and are the primary source of funds to pay insurance claims 
all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale  which are those securities that would be available to be sold in the future in response to our liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates and asset liability management strategies 
available for sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
investment income includes amortization of premium and accrual of discount on the yield to maturity method relating to investments acquired at other than par value 
equity securities are carried at quoted market values 
fair values of fixed maturities and equity securities are determined on the basis of dealer or market quotations or comparable securities on which quotations are available 
mortgage loans are carried at the unpaid principal balance which approximates the fair market value as they bear current market interest rates 
real estate is carried at historical cost  less accumulated depreciation 
we periodically review the investment portfolio for any potential credit quality or collection issues and for any securities with respect to which we consider any decline in market value to be other than temporary 
investments which are considered impaired are written down to their estimated net realizable value 
realized gains or losses on sales or maturities of investments are determined on a specific identification basis and are credited or charged to income 
reserve for extended reporting period claims 
the reserve for extended reporting period claims coverage is recorded during the term of the original claims made policy  utilizing the pure premium approach  in amounts believed to be adequate to pay for estimated future claims reported subsequent to a current policyholder s death  disability or retirement 
amounts are estimated on a basis similar to the estimates made in respect of the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
changes in this reserve are reflected as an expense in the period in which the adjustment is made 
reinsurance 
in accordance with industry practice  we cede to other insurance companies some of the potential liability under insurance policies we have underwritten 
this practice  called reinsurance  helps us reduce our net liability on individual risks  stabilize our underwriting results and increase our underwriting capacity 
as payment for sharing a portion of our risk  we are also required to share a part of the premium we receive on the related policies 
we determine the amount and scope of reinsurance coverage to purchase each year based upon an evaluation of the risks accepted  consultations with reinsurance brokers and a review of market conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
our reinsurance arrangements are generally renegotiated annually 
reinsurance premiums and losses related to reinsured business are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
premiums ceded to other companies are reported as a reduction of premium income 
reinsured losses incurred are reported as a reduction of gross losses incurred 
key ratios by product set forth below are our gaap ratios by product line for each of the last three years 
the loss ratio compares our losses and loss adjustment expenses to our net premiums earned and indicates how much we expect to pay to policyholders for claims and related settlement expenses compared to the amount of premiums we earn 
the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business 
the underwriting expense ratio compares our expenses to obtain new business and renew existing business plus normal operating expenses to our net premiums earned and is used to measure how efficient we are at obtaining business and operating the company 
the lower the percentage  the more efficient we are 
sometimes  however  a higher underwriting expense can result in better business and improve our loss ratio and overall profitability 
the combined ratio compares the sum of our underwriting expense ratio and our loss ratio 
the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business is 
this ratio excludes the effects of investment income

medical professional liability net premiums earned were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase in net premiums earned was mainly due to price increases and reduced discounts we instituted in all states 
also  we experienced greater penetration of the florida and illinois markets 
however  these factors were offset by the reduction in the number of insured physicians in ohio and kentucky due to re underwriting efforts 
we are currently seeking regulatory approval of significant additional rate increases 
medical professional liability incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the incurred loss and loss adjustment expense ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the increase in loss ratio was due primarily to reserve adjustments taken in the third and fourth quarters  which related to prior accident years and revisions made to current year expected losses 
due to the unexpected significant increase in reported losses and claim severity primarily in our newer markets in the third quarter of  including an unusually high frequency of large claims  we undertook and completed a comprehensive internal actuarial study 
as a result of this study  we revised the actuarial assumptions upon which loss reserves are based and adjusted loss reserves accordingly 
the reserve adjustments included a total of approximately million increase on prior accident years  primarily the and years 
in addition  the current accident year loss estimates were increased to approximately million to reflect our revised assumptions regarding loss development patterns 
the adjustments were made primarily as a result of losses in our ohio  florida and kentucky medical professional liability markets 
ohio and florida are relatively new markets for us and have higher policy limits 
thus  actual loss development can be volatile and difficult to predict 
with these revised loss assumptions  the accident year net loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is 
we discontinued offering higher policy limits in ohio and florida in the third quarter of medical professional liability underwriting expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the underwriting expense ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for this increase was due primarily to the growth of premiums in states where we pay higher commissions than we pay in michigan  where we have an arrangement with scw agency group  inc where we pay commissions at rates that are lower than market 
our president and chief executive officer is the principal owner of scw agency group  inc in addition  we recorded the maximum ceded premium on all affected swing rated reinsurance treaties due to the higher losses  which amounted to a million increase in ceded premiums 
workers compensation insurance operations 
workers compensation net premiums earned were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase in net premiums earned was due primarily to retroactive premium adjustments and reduced credits following audits  as well as growth in the number of policies written in the states of minnesota  illinois and indiana 
we are seeking regulatory approval of significant additional rate increases 
workers compensation incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the incurred loss and loss adjustment expense ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the increasing loss ratio was due to an overall pattern of increasing losses  especially in our newer states  illinois  iowa and kentucky  where we have less historical data on which to base our estimates 
as a result of these high loss patterns  we increased our prior year reserves in almost all markets by a total of million 
the current accident year loss estimates were increased to million  primarily in the markets noted above 
after these adjustments  the accident year net loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is 
workers compensation underwriting expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the underwriting expense ratio decreased to for the year ended december   from for the decrease resulted primarily from our expense reduction initiatives  lower assessments and fees  and premium increases 
health insurance operations 
health net premiums earned were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase was due to one health insurance program through a preferred provider organization in western michigan 
we discontinued all of our other health insurance programs during health incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to the incurred loss and loss adjustment expense ratio increased to for the year ended december   from for the increase in loss ratio was due to overall increases in health care costs  primarily in the state of michigan 
we are increasing health insurance premium rates to offset these higher health loss costs 
health underwriting expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to the underwriting expense ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the reduction was directly related to our expense reduction initiatives and premium increases 
personal and commercial lines insurance operations 
personal and commercial net premiums earned were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the decrease was due to our exiting this line of business 
there will be no premiums in future periods 
personal and commercial incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or  compared to the incurred loss and loss adjustment expense ratio increased to for the year ended december   from for the increasing loss ratio was due primarily to a higher amount of winter storm related losses in and the adverse effects of discontinuing this line of business 
personal and commercial underwriting expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the underwriting expense ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the reduction was directly related to our exit from this line of business beginning in the fourth quarter of corporate  investments and other 
net investment income  excluding realized investment gains and losses  was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to approximately million of the annual increase is attributable to investment of the proceeds of our initial public offering received in december in addition  in we liquidated approximately million in equity securities  invested the proceeds in interest income producing government and corporate bonds and shifted some of our portfolio from tax exempt securities to higher yielding taxable corporate securities 
net realized losses and gains were million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively 
approximately million of the loss was attributable to a security whose decline in market value in we considered to be other than temporary 
we maintain a portfolio of cash and short term investments to meet operating cash needs  fund the share repurchase programs and fund potential acquisitions 
recent reductions in short term interest rates have reduced the yields generated by this portfolio 
our general and administrative expenses increased million to million during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to new costs incurred by the holding company becoming publicly traded in december these costs include stock market listing fees  investor relations fees  shareholder meeting costs and securities reporting expenses 
we expect the general and administrative expenses for to be more representative of continuing operations 
we incurred an additional restructuring charge of million in the elimination of nine staff members located in our now closed michigan personal and commercial branch office resulted in  of this charge 
the remainder of the charge was related to severance costs incurred in the elimination of staff members at our east lansing home office in the information systems department and senior management 
these actions were taken as part of an overall corporate restructuring 
the expected annual savings for the entire restructuring is million 
at december   there was  accrued for restructuring charges that was paid in january we recorded million in federal income tax benefit for the year ended december   compared to a million expense during  due to the loss for the effective tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to for the effective tax rate was lower due to the greater impact of tax exempt interest 
on march   new tax laws extended the net operating loss carryback period from two years to five years 
as a result  approximately million of the company s net operating loss carryforward at december  will be utilized to recover taxes previously paid in tax years   and this additional loss carryback will result in an increase to the reported federal income taxes recoverable with a corresponding decrease in deferred federal income taxes in the first quarter of results of operations compared to medical professional liability insurance operations 
net premiums earned increased by million  or  to million in this increase reflects the increase in direct premiums written and changes in our reinsurance program  primarily eliminating the quota share arrangement in florida 
losses and loss adjustment expenses increased million  or  to million in the reported loss ratio was compared to in the accident year loss ratio  which excludes the effects of prior year developments of loss reserves  was in compared to in the medical professional liability loss ratio increase was due to higher losses in some of our newer markets  particularly ohio and florida 
medical professional liability policy acquisition and underwriting expenses were million in compared to million in as a percentage of premiums earned  the medical professional liability underwriting expense ratio decreased to in from in this decrease was due primarily to expense reduction measures that we began implementing in the fourth quarter of and the acquisition of the management company in workers compensation insurance operations

personal and commercial lines insurance operations 
personal and commercial lines net premiums earned increased million  or  to million in primarily due to rate increases 
however  with the conclusion of  we began the process of winding down the personal and commercial segment 
the personal and commercial loss ratio was in and in the personal and commercial loss ratio reflected higher winter storm losses 
personal and commercial underwriting expenses increased  or  to million in as a percentage of premiums earned  the underwriting expense ratio decreased to in from in this decrease was due to specific expense reduction efforts for this line of business 
corporate  investments and other 
investment income  excluding realized investment gains  increased million  or  to million in the increase reflects a shift of some of our portfolio from tax exempt securities to higher yield taxable corporate securities in the first quarter of and a higher amount of invested assets 
net realized investment gains were million and million during and  respectively 
additional restructuring charges of  were incurred in this includes approximately  in severance charges related to the elimination of staff members located in our new mexico and lapeer branch offices and our health insurance operation at our east lansing  michigan home office 
these events are expected to generate annual savings of approximately million in salaries and rent 
at december  there was  accrued for restructuring charges that were paid in we have incurred  of conversion expenses in the increase in amortization expense is a result of the acquisition of a management company in october which previously had performed all of the managerial functions for apassurance and its subsidiaries 
we recorded million in federal income tax expense in  compared to a refund of million in federal income taxes during the same period in the effective tax rate was in  compared to in in  we received a significant settlement with the irs regarding the tax treatment of reserves 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity  on both a short and long term basis  are funds provided by insurance premiums collected  net investment income  recoveries from reinsurance and proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets 
the primary uses of cash  on both a short and long term basis  are losses  loss adjustment expenses  operating expenses  reinsurance premiums and taxes 
in addition  we are indebted to a related party in the amount of million in connection with the purchase of stratton cheeseman management company 
the indebtedness is due in annual installments  without interest  over the next eight years 
at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
our net cash flow from operating activities was approximately million for  compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to the large net loss in and a federal income tax recovery and related interest totaling million in we invest our positive cash flow from operations in both fixed maturity securities and equity securities 
our investment strategy seeks to maximize after tax income through a high quality  diversified  duration sensitive  taxable bond and tax preferenced municipal bond portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
should we experience a dramatic decrease in premiums and operating cash flow  funds to operate the company and to pay claims would come from investment earnings and liquidation of the investment portfolio 
in  on a consolidated basis  we had million of cash available and an investment portfolio of million 
the large cash position at december  reflects the residual of the net proceeds of million from our stock offerings in december the portfolio includes million of bonds maturing in the next year to meet short term cash flow needs 
on a long term basis  fixed income securities are purchased on a basis intended to provide adequate cash flows from future maturities 
at december   million of bonds mature in the next one to five years and million mature in the next five to ten years 
total assets increased million to billion at december   compared to million at december  the increase was due primarily to increases in reinsurance recoverables  federal income tax recoverable  and accrued investment income 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves increased million to million at december   from million at december  this increase was due to increased writings in both the workers compensation and medical professional liability lines and the reserve enhancements incurred in the third and fourth quarters of the unearned premium reserve increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  the increase was due primarily to the higher seasonal writing in medical professional liability in the third quarter of in march  our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to of its then outstanding common stock  representing approximately  shares 
the company s purchase of any of its shares is subject to limitations that may be imposed by applicable securities laws and regulations and the rules of the nasdaq stock market 
the timing of the purchases and the number of shares to be bought at any one time depend on market conditions and our capital requirements 
in july and november of  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of a total of million additional shares 
as of december   the company has purchased a total of  shares under the three authorized programs  at a cost of million 
the company intends to continue repurchasing its shares  in the market and otherwise  when appropriate using available cash resources 
based on historical trends  market conditions and its business plans  we believe that our existing resources and sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our short and long term liquidity needs over the next months and beyond 
however  because economic  market and regulatory conditions may change  there can be no assurance that our funds will be sufficient to meet these liquidity needs 
apcapital itself is a holding company whose only material assets are the capital stock of apassurance and its other subsidiaries and a portion of the net proceeds from the stock offerings completed in december apcapital is using these funds to finance its long and short term liquidity needs  which include operating expenses  financing future acquisitions  additional share repurchases  and additional contributions to its subsidiaries 
apcapital s ongoing cash flow will consist primarily of dividends and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries and investment earnings on funds held 
the payment of dividends to apcapital by its insurance subsidiaries is subject to limitations imposed by applicable law 
apassurance s ability to pay dividends to apcapital is influenced by a variety of factors  including cyclical changes in the medical professional liability insurance market  apassurance s financial results  insurance regulatory changes  including changes in the limitations imposed by the michigan holding company systems act on the payment of dividends by apassurance and changes in general economic conditions 
effects of inflation we consider the effects of inflation on our business in estimating our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  and in the premium rate making process 
the actual effects of inflation on our operations cannot be accurately known until the ultimate settlement of claims 
however  based upon the actual results reported to date  it is our opinion that our loss reserves  including reserves for losses that have been incurred but not yet reported  adequately provide for the effects of inflation 
effects of new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  as amended by sfas nos 
and 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction  and if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
because we currently do not use derivative instruments  the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect our results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets 
these standards provide guidance on the accounting for acquired businesses 
in addition  these standards eliminate the pooling of interest method for transactions initiated after june   and effective january   eliminate the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life 
the standards require annual impairment testing and potential loss recognization for goodwill and intangible assets 
the change regarding the elimination of goodwill and other intangible amortization will be made prospectively with the adoption of the new standard as of january  prior period financial results will not be restated 
management is currently evaluating implementation of this standard  however  anticipates that we have no finite lived intangibles  and as a result  will no longer incur amortization expense on our recorded goodwill beginning january  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard will be effective for the company on a prospective basis  beginning january  sfas no 
clarifies and revises existing guidance on accounting for impairment of property  plant  and equipment  amortized intangibles  and other long lived assets not specifically addressed in other accounting literature 
management does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we invest primarily in fixed maturity securities  which are interest sensitive assets 
accordingly  our primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the majority of our investment portfolio was invested in fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
the fixed maturity securities primarily consisted of us government and agency bonds  high quality corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities and tax exempt us municipal bonds 
qualitative information about market risk investments in our portfolio have varying degrees of risk 
the primary market risk exposure to the fixed maturity portfolio is interest rate risk  which is limited somewhat by our management of duration 
the distribution of maturities and sector concentrations are monitored on a regular basis 
we regularly examine the quality distribution of our investment portfolio for evidence of impairment 
when a security in our investment portfolio has a decline in market value which is other than temporary  we are required by gaap to reduce the carrying value of such security to its net realizable value 
all declines in market values of our investment securities at december  were deemed to be temporary with the exception of an investment in frontier bonds  which were written down million during quantitative information about market risk at december   our fixed income security portfolio was valued at million and had an average modified duration of years  compared to a portfolio valued at million with an average modified duration of years at december  the following tables show the effects of a change in interest rates on the fair value and duration of our portfolio at december  and we have assumed an immediate increase or decrease of or in interest rate for illustrative purposes 
you should not consider this assumption or the values shown in the table to be a prediction of actual future results
