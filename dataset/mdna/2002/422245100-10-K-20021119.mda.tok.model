the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 
the following table sets forth the sources of the company s revenues by customer type as a percentage of total revenues from continuing operations for the years ended august   and year ended august  health plan contracts hospital contracts other the company believes that a substantial portion of its future revenue growth will result from health plan customer contracts 

table of contents for information on the company s business segments  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition fees under the company s hospital contracts are generally fixed fee and are recorded as services are provided 
fees under the company s health plan contracts are generally determined by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month pmpm by the number of health plan members covered by the company s services during the month 
in some contracts  the pmpm rate may differ between the health plan product groups eg ppo  hmo  medicare 
these contracts are generally for terms of three to five years with provisions for subsequent renewal and typically provide that between and of the company s fees may be refundable performance based 
the company earns performance based fees upon achieving a targeted percentage reduction in the customer s healthcare costs  in addition to clinical and other criteria that focus on improving the health of the members  compared to a baseline year 
approximately of the company s revenues recorded during the year ended august  were performance based 
a limited number of contracts also provide opportunities for incentive fees in excess of the contractual pmpm rate if the company is able to achieve an even greater reduction in the customer s healthcare costs compared to the targeted reduction 
the company bills its customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due for the prior month s enrollment  which always includes the amount  if any  that may be subject to refund 
the monthly billing does not include any potential incentive fees which are not due until after contract settlement 
the company recognizes revenue during the period the services are performed as follows the fixed portion of the monthly fees are recognized as revenue during the period the services are performed  the performance based portion of the monthly fees are recognized based on performance to date in the contract year  additional incentive fees are recognized based on performance to date in the contract year to the extent such amounts are considered collectible based on credit risk and or business relationships 
the company assesses its level of performance based on medical claims and other data contractually required to be supplied monthly by the health plan customer 
estimates that may be included in the company s assessment of performance include medical claims incurred but not reported and a health plan s medical cost trend compared to a baseline year 
in addition  the company may also provide reserves  as appropriate  for billing adjustments at contract reconciliation and for the collectibility of incentive fees contractual reserves 
in the event interim performance measures indicate that performance targets are not being met  or data from the health plan is insufficient to measure performance  fees subject to refund are not recognized as revenues but rather are recorded as a current liability in contract billings in excess of earnings 
the company would reverse revenues previously recognized only in those situations in which performance to date in the contract year  previously above targeted levels  dropped below targeted levels due to subsequent adverse performance and or adjustments in contractual reserves 

table of contents the contractual settlement process under a contract  which generally is not completed until six to eight months after the end of a contract year  involves reconciliation of health care claims and clinical data 
data reconciliation differences between the company and the customer can arise due to health plan data deficiencies  omissions and or data discrepancies  for which the company provides contractual allowances until agreement is reached with respect to identified issues 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill the company elected early adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on september   the beginning of the fiscal year  at which time it ceased amortization of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill acquired is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in the event the company determines that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired based upon an impairment review  the measurement of any impairment is calculated using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required under the provisions of sfas no 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between two willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the company s other identifiable intangible assets  such as covenants not to compete and acquired technologies  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the company also assesses the impairment of its other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in the event the company determines that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  the measurement of any impairment is calculated using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and or other intangible assets associated with its acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
health plan contracts a majority of the company s fiscal through revenues were generated from programs that are designed to assist health plans in reducing healthcare costs and improving the quality of care for health plan members with chronic diseases such as diabetes  cardiac disease and respiratory disease 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its future revenue growth will continue to result from providing disease management and care enhancement services to health plans 
implementation of the company s first disease management contracts with health plans occurred in fiscal for enrollees of these health plans with diabetes 
while continuing to contract with additional health plans to provide diabetes services in the years since fiscal  the company introduced its cardiac disease management program in fiscal and its respiratory disease management program in fiscal during fiscal 
table of contents  the company signed its first contracts with health plans to deliver its cardiac and respiratory disease programs 
during fiscal  the company announced the launch of its total population care enhancement strategy designed to identify and provide care enhancement services for health plan members identified as having or at risk for developing one or more high cost diseases or impact conditions 
during fiscal  the company signed and implemented three total population care enhancement contracts and became the first organization to be accredited by both the national committee on quality assurance and the american accreditation healthcare commission 
in october  the company obtained certification by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations and became the first and only care enhancement provider in the nation to be accredited or certified by all three organizations 
the company s disease management and care enhancement programs assist enrollees and their health plan s affiliated health care service providers with specific disease or condition related care enhancement services 
the company believes that its patient and physician support regimens  delivered and or supervised by a multi disciplinary team  assist in ensuring that effective care for the treatment of the disease or condition is provided  which will improve the health status of the enrollee populations with the disease or condition and reduce both the short term and long term healthcare costs for these enrollees 
the company s health plan disease management and care enhancement services range from telephone and mail contacts directed primarily to health plan members with targeted diseases from one of the company s six care enhancement centers to services that include providing local market resources to address acute episode interventions and coordination of care with local healthcare providers 
fees under the company s health plan contracts are generally determined by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month by the number of health plan members covered by the company s services during the month 
in some contracts  the pmpm rate may differ between the health plan product groups eg ppo  hmo  medicare 
contracts are generally for terms of three to five years with provisions for subsequent renewal and typically provide that between and of the company s fees may be refundable performance based 
the company earns performance based fees upon achieving a targeted percentage reduction in the customer s healthcare costs  in addition to clinical and other criteria that focus on improving the health of the members  compared to a baseline year 
approximately of the company s revenues recorded during the year ended august  were performance based 
a limited number of contracts also provide opportunities for incentive fees in excess of the contractual pmpm rate if the company is able to achieve an even greater reduction in the customer s healthcare costs compared to the targeted reduction 
the company anticipates that additional disease management and care enhancement contracts that the company may sign with health plans may take one of several forms  including per member per month payments to the company to cover its services to enrollees  some form of shared savings of overall enrollee healthcare costs  or some combination of these arrangements 
the company anticipates that under most contracts  some portion of the company s fees will be at risk subject to its performance against financial cost savings  clinical  and other performance criteria 
the membership enrollment and disenrollment processes of the company s health plan customers can result in a seasonal reduction in lives under management during the company s second fiscal quarter 
employers typically make decisions on which health insurance carriers they will offer to their employees and also may allow employees to switch between health plans on an annual basis 
historically  the company has found that a majority of these decisions are made effective december of each year 
an employer s change in health plans or employees change in health plan elections will result in the company s loss of covered lives under management as of december although these decisions may also result in a gain in enrollees  the process of identifying new members eligible to participate in the company s programs is dependent on the submission of healthcare claims  which lags enrollment by an indeterminate period 
as a result  historically the company has experienced a loss of covered lives of between and on december that is not restored through new member identification until later in the fiscal year  thereby negatively affecting the company s revenues in its second fiscal quarter 

table of contents disease management and care enhancement health plan contracts require sophisticated management information systems to enable the company to manage the care of large populations of patients with certain chronic diseases such as diabetes  cardiac disease and respiratory disease as well as certain other medical conditions and to assist in reporting outcomes and costs before and after the company s involvement with a health plan s enrollees 
the company has developed and is continually expanding and improving its clinical management systems which it believes meet its information management needs for its disease management and care enhancement services 
the company has installed and is utilizing the systems for the enrollees of each of its health plan contract customers 
the anticipated expansion and improvement in its information management systems will continue to require significant investments by the company in information technology software  hardware and its information technology staff 
at august   the company had contracts with health plans to provide disease management services in health plan markets 
the company reports the number of covered lives serviced under its health plan contracts in terms of equivalent lives 
because the company s original disease management services were focused on health plan members with diabetes  the equivalent life calculation is based on the fees and average service intensity of a diabetic life 
although the average service intensity and fee for a health plan member with cardiac or respiratory disease differs from diabetes  the company believes that the percent contribution margin is approximately the same 
equivalent lives reported as under management are health plan members to whom the company is providing services 
equivalent lives reported in backlog are the estimated number of health plan members for whom services have been contracted but are not yet being provided 
the number of equivalent lives under management as well as the backlog of equivalent lives under contract are shown below at august   and at august  equivalent lives under management equivalent lives in backlog total equivalent lives during the fiscal years ended august   and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenues were derived from contracts with two health plans that each comprised more than of the company s revenues for those years 
during fiscal  two health plans each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
during fiscal  one of these health plan contracts was terminated and a contract with a new health plan comprising more than of the company s fiscal revenues was added 
during fiscal  the same two health plans as in each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
the loss of either of these contracts or any other large health plan contract or a reduction in the profitability of any of these contracts would have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s health plan contract revenues are dependent upon the contractual relationships it establishes and maintains with health plans to provide disease management and care enhancement services to their members 
the terms of these health plan contracts generally range from three to five years with some contracts providing for early termination by the health plan under certain conditions 
because the disease management industry is relatively new and the company s contracts were some of the first large scale contracts to be executed with health plans for disease management services  the renewal experience for these contracts is limited 
no assurances can be given that the results from restructurings and possible terminations at or prior to renewal would not have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
during the year ended august   
table of contents three health plan contracts were scheduled to expire 
one of these contracts was extended to fiscal  one contract was renewed  and one contract was renewed and expanded to include additional lives and an additional disease 
in addition  one contract not scheduled to expire until was terminated early by the company 
during the fiscal year ending august   five health plan customer contracts representing of the company s revenues for fiscal are scheduled to expire under the terms of the contracts 
three additional contracts representing approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal and which also would have expired under the terms of the contracts during fiscal were renewed during fiscal on terms substantially the same as the terms in the original contracts 
in addition  four contracts representing of the company s revenue in fiscal are eligible for early termination in fiscal no assurance can be given that unscheduled contract terminations or renegotiations would not have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the company entered into a strategic alliance agreement with johns hopkins university and health system for the establishment of an outcomes verification program to independently evaluate and verify the effectiveness of clinical interventions and their clinical and financial results 
this five year strategic alliance agreement was effective december  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the company pays johns hopkins annual compensation of million per year and issued  unregistered shares of common stock to johns hopkins 
one half of the  shares vested immediately  and the remaining  shares vest on december  hospital contracts the company s hospital based diabetes treatment centers are located in and operated under contracts with general acute care hospitals 
the primary goal of each center is to create a center of excellence for the treatment of diabetes in the community in which it is located and thereby increase the hospital s market share of diabetes patients and lower the hospital s cost of providing services while enhancing the quality of care to this population 
fee structures under the hospital contracts consist primarily of fixed management fees  but some contracts may also include variable fees based on the company s performance 
fixed management fees are recorded as services are provided 
variable fees based upon performance generally provide for payments to the company based on changes in the client hospital s market share of diabetes inpatients  the costs of providing care to these patients  and quality of care measurements 
the company has renewed or entered into new contracts in recent years that included primarily fixed management fee arrangements 
the terms of hospital contracts generally range from two to five years and are subject to periodic renegotiation and renewal that may include reduction in fee structures that have a negative impact on the company s revenues and profitability 
the form of these contracts includes various structures ranging from arrangements where all costs of the company s program for center professional personnel and community relations are the responsibility of the company to structures where all company program costs are the responsibility of the client hospital 
the company is paid directly by the hospital 
patients receiving services from the diabetes treatment centers are charged by the hospital for typical hospital services 
under the terms of its contracts with hospitals  the company provides the resources that enable the hospital to develop and operate an integrated system of care for patients with diabetes that includes programs to work with physicians to identify objectives for the patient and monitor accomplishment of the objectives during the patient s stay  clinical interventions for patients with diabetes  an information network service that connects the hospital to the company s dedicated nationwide resources  programs for specific activities related to quality improvement  cost reduction and market share increases for patients with diabetes  and programs to monitor the hospital s performance against quality indicators and processes related to diabetes patients 
also available for hospital customers are numerous other services such as outpatient diabetes patient education and follow up  programs for diabetes during pregnancy and programs for insulin pump therapy  and policies and procedures to help ensure formal recognition of the diabetes program at the hospital by the american diabetes association 

table of contents the company s hospital based diabetes treatment center business had contracts in effect in states at august  the company also had a contract to operate one hospital based arthritis and osteoporosis treatment center during fiscal  this contract was discontinued during fiscal the following table presents the number of total hospital contracts in effect during the past three fiscal years year ended august  contracts in effect at beginning of period contracts signed contracts discontinued contracts in effect at end of period hospital sites where services are delivered during fiscal  hospital contracts were renewed 
several of these renewals included contract rate reductions  which the company has undertaken to maintain long term contractual relationships 
also during fiscal  seven hospital contracts were discontinued 
the company had no material continuing obligations or costs associated with the termination of any client hospital contracts 
the company anticipates that continued hospital industry pressures to reduce costs because of constrained revenues will result in a continuation of contract rate reductions and the potential for additional contract terminations 
during fiscal  contracts representing of the company s revenues for fiscal are subject to expiration if not renewed and an additional contracts representing of the company s revenues for fiscal have early cancellation provisions that could result in early contract termination 
the hospital industry continues to experience pressures on its profitability as a result of constrained revenues from governmental and private revenue sources as well as from increasing underlying medical care costs 
as a result  average revenue per hospital contract for the years ended august  and declined by and  respectively  compared with the same periods in the prior year 
the company believes that these pressures will continue 
while the company believes that its products are geared specifically to assist hospitals in controlling the high costs associated with the treatment of diabetes  the pressures to reduce costs immediately may have a negative effect  in certain circumstances  on the ability of or the length of time required by the company to sign new hospital contracts as well as on the company s ability to retain hospital contracts 
this focus on cost reduction may also result in a continuation of downward pressure on the fee structures of existing contracts 
there can be no assurance that these financial pressures will not continue to have a negative impact on the company s hospital contract operations 
the company s strategy is to develop new and expand existing relationships with health plans and hospitals to provide disease management and care enhancement services 
the company anticipates that it will utilize its state of the art care enhancement centers and medical information technologies to gain a competitive advantage in delivering its health plan disease management services 
in addition  the company has added services to its product mix for health plans that extend the company s programs beyond a chronic disease focus and provide care enhancement services to individuals identified with one or more additional conditions or who are at risk for developing these diseases or conditions 
the company believes that significant cost savings and improvements in care can result from addressing care management and treatment requirements for these additional selected diseases and conditions  which will enable the company to address a much larger percentage of a health plan s total healthcare costs 
the company anticipates that significant costs will be incurred during fiscal due to the expansion of clinical programs  the associated information technology support for these expanded care enhancement 
table of contents initiatives and the opening of additional care enhancement centers and that many of these costs will be incurred prior to the initiation of revenues from new contracts 
it is also anticipated that some of these new capabilities and technologies may be added through strategic alliances with other entities and that the company may choose to make minority interest investments in or acquire for stock or cash one or more of these entities 
at a special meeting of stockholders on october   the stockholders approved an amendment to the company s restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the company s common stock from  to  on october   the company s board of directors approved a three for two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend distributed on november  to stockholders of record at the close of business on november  the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of stockholders equity have been restated as if the split and the increase in authorized shares had occurred on august  earnings per share  weighted average common shares and equivalents and stock option information have been retroactively restated as if the split had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal primarily due to an increase in the average number of equivalent lives enrolled in the company s health plan contracts to approximately  for from approximately  for and contract performance incentive bonus revenues of approximately million recognized during fiscal the increase in the average number of equivalent lives under management was primarily the result of new health plan contracts signed during fiscal and the average revenue per member per month for equivalent lives enrolled under the company s health plan contracts was greater during than for this increase in average per member per month revenue occurred primarily as a result of improved performance under the terms of performance based fees and incentive fee provisions of health plan contracts during the period compared with the increase in health plan contract revenues was offset partially by decreased revenues from hospital based diabetes treatment center contracts 
revenues from the company s hospital contract operations for were less than principally due to rate reductions on contract renewals partially offset by a slightly higher average number of contracts in operation during compared with average revenue per hospital contract was approximately lower in than in due primarily to contract fee reductions and lower average fees on new contracts in the company anticipates that revenues for fiscal will increase over fiscal revenues primarily as a result of additional lives enrolled under its existing and anticipated new health plan contracts which may be offset somewhat by lower revenues from hospital contract operations resulting from contract fee reductions and contract terminations 
cost of services for fiscal increased million or from fiscal primarily due to higher staffing levels associated with increases in the number of equivalent lives covered in the company s health plan contracts  the opening of an additional care enhancement center in march as well as increased employee incentive compensation associated with improved operating performance compared with the prior fiscal year 
cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased to for  compared to for primarily as a result of improved revenue performance at the company s health plan contract operations 
the company anticipates that cost of services for fiscal will increase over fiscal cost of services primarily as a result of increased operating staff required for expected increases in the number of equivalent lives enrolled under the company s health plan contracts  increased indirect staff costs associated with the development and implementation of its new total population care enhancement services and increases in information technology staff 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased million or from fiscal primarily due to an increase in selling and marketing expenses associated with the company s investment in sales and marketing expertise and strategic relationships  and an increase in general corporate expenses attributable to growth in the company s health plan operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for decreased to from in the prior year period primarily as a result of the company s ability to more effectively leverage its selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of growth in the company s health plan operations 
the company anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal will increase over fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales and marketing expenses  increased support costs required for the company s rapidly growing health plan segment  and increased costs associated with a full year under the company s strategic alliance with johns hopkins university and health system 
depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal increased million or from fiscal primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense associated with equipment  software development  and computer related capital expenditures related to enhancements in the company s health plan information technology capabilities  the addition of one care enhancement center and expansion of two existing centers offset by the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in the fiscal period as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that upon adoption  amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets will cease and instead  the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets will be evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis or more frequently if certain indicators are encountered 
identifiable intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no

as of this date  the company no longer amortized goodwill 
goodwill amortization expense for the fiscal year ended august  was million 
the company anticipates that depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal will increase over fiscal primarily as a result of additional capital expenditures associated with expected increases in the number of equivalent lives enrolled under the company s health plan contracts  additional care enhancement centers  growth and improvement in the company s information technology capabilities and the implementation of its new total population care enhancement strategy 
the company s interest expense was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense for fiscal increased million from fiscal primarily due to fees related to outstanding letters of credit to support the company s contractual requirement to repay fees in the event the company does not perform at established target levels and does not repay the fees due in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
the company s income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase in the income tax expense between these periods resulted primarily from an increase in profitability 
the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and the company s effective tax rate of in fiscal are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes and certain non deductible expenses for income tax purposes

the company has never had a draw under an outstanding letter of credit 
the company believes that cash flow from operating activities  its available cash and available credit under its credit agreement will continue to enable the company to fund the current level of growth in its health plan operations
