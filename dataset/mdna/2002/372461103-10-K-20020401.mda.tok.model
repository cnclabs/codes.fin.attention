item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview since  we have been supplying advanced manufacturing systems to the semiconductor industry worldwide 
major semiconductor manufacturers use our leading edge thin film deposition equipment and process technology to produce integrated circuits  commonly called chips that are incorporated into a variety of products including personal computers  communications  equipment and consumer electronics 
we pioneered the development of chemical vapor deposition cvd tungsten silicide  which is used in certain critical steps in the manufacture of integrated circuits 
in addition  today we are leading the commercialization of atomic layer deposition  also known as ald technology 
this technology is designed to enable a wide spectrum of thin film applications such as aluminum oxide  hafnium oxide and other advanced dielectric insulating and conducting metal barrier materials for advanced integrated circuit manufacturing 
genus consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on a quarterly basis  management reevaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and relevant current conditions and adjusts the financial statements as required 
our global customer base consists of semiconductor manufacturers in the united states  europe and asia 
over the past few years we were dependent on one customer  samsung  for a majority of our thin film product revenue 
samsung accounted for of our revenue in  in and in there is no long term agreement between us and samsung 
in  we shipped our lynx r system to a new customer  micron technology  and in the first quarter of  we shipped an ald system to infineon technologies  also a new customer 
in  we shipped systems to four new customers 
international revenue accounted for of revenue in  of revenue in and of revenue in we anticipate that international sales  and in particular from south korea  will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue 
the company s selling arrangements generally involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product occurs after shipment and transfer of title 
as a result  effective january   to comply with the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 the company deferred the recognition of revenue from such equipment sales until installation is complete and the product is accepted by the customer 
prior to january   revenue related to systems had been generally recognized upon shipment 
a provision for the estimated future cost of system installation  warranty and commissions was recorded when revenue was recognized 
under sab  warranty obligations are accrued upon final customer acceptance  which coincides with recognition of revenue 
the cost of inventory shipped to customers for which we are awaiting customer acceptance is recorded as inventory at customers locations 
the local currency is the functional currency for our foreign operations in south korea and japan 
all other currency is dollar denominated 
gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local currencies are the functional currency are included as a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive loss 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in the statement of operations 
business activity in the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries has been cyclical  for this and other reasons  genus results of operations for the twelve months ended december   may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
in order to support our business strategy  we will be required to make significant investments in research and development 
in addition  we believe selling  general and administrative costs will increase as sales volumes increase 
we depend on increases in sales in order to attain profitability 
if our sales do not increase  our current operating expenses could prevent us from attaining profitability and harm our financial results 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  accrual for warranty expenses  valuation of inventories and valuation of research and demonstration equipment demonstration equipment 
revenue recognition genus revenue recognition policy is based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
genus recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed and determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and genus has completed any systems installation obligations 
revenues from sales of systems and major system upgrades are currently recognized when installation is complete and the customer accepts the product  in writing 
revenues from sale of spare parts and system upgrades are recognized upon shipment 
revenues related to maintenance and service contracts are recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
revenues can fluctuate significantly as a result of the timing of customers acceptances 
at december  and  the company had deferred revenue of million and million  respectively 
accrual for warranty expenses the company provides one year labor and two year material warranty on its products 
warranty expenses are accrued upon revenue recognition 
at present  based upon historical experience  the company accrues material warranty equal to and of shipment value for its lynx r and lynx products  respectively  and labor warranty equal to  per system for both its lynx r and lynx products 
at the end of every quarter  the company reviews its actual spending on warranty and reassess if its accrual is adequate to cover warranty expenses on the systems in the field which are still under warranty 
differences between the required accrual and booked accrual are charged to warranty expenses for the period 
at december  and  the company accrued  and  respectively  for material and labor warranty obligations 
actual results could differ from estimates 
in the unlikely event that a problem is identified that would result in the need to replace components on a large scale  material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
raw material and purchased parts include spare parts inventory for systems at a carrying value of million and million for and  respectively 
the forecasted demand for spare parts take into account the company s obligations to support systems for periods that are as long as years 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by the company 
this could have a material effect on operating results and the financial position 
in  as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and diminished demand for semiconductor products  the company experienced a decline in sales and recorded inventory charges of  related primarily to excess inventories 
these charges have been included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december  and  the company had inventory valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
valuation of research and demonstration equipment equipment  furniture and fixtures are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to ten years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term  whichever is less 
equipment includes research and demonstration equipment  which is located in our applications laboratory and are used to demonstrate to our customers the capabilities of our equipment to process wafers and deposit films 
the gross value of demonstration equipment is based on the cost of materials and actual factory labor and overhead expenses incurred in manufacturing the equipment 
costs related to refurbishing or maintaining existing demonstration equipment  which do not add to the capabilities or useful life of the equipment  are not capitalized and are expensed as incurred 
demonstration equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over a period of five years 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets related to those assets may not be recoverable  the company estimates the future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  expected to result from the use of those assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amounts of those assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amounts over the fair values of the assets 
results of operations compared with revenues in were million  up from revenues in were based on customer acceptances on twelve systems including seven mm systems using cvd technology  one mm system using cvd technology and four mm systems using ald technology 
revenues in were based on customer acceptances of eleven mm cvd systems and one mm ald system 
average selling prices in were slightly higher than in reflecting a favorable mix of more ald and mm modules  which in general  have higher prices than cvd and mm products 
revenues from sale of spare parts and services in were million  approximately the same as in going forward we expect revenues in to be up compared to with most of the growth coming in the second half of the year 
shipments in were million  below for the semiconductor equipment industry as a whole  shipments in were below  based on data published by vlsi research 
orders in were million  below the level of orders received in for the semiconductor equipment industry as a whole  orders in were below  based on data published by vlsi research 
orders in included bookings for three cvd mm systems  one cvd process module and four ald systems 
orders in included bookings for ten mm cvd systems and two ald systems 
we ended with a total of seven customers serving four market segments capacitor  logic  data storage and mems  compared to two customers serving only the capacitor market segment in we now offer two product platforms  the lynx  which can be used to produce both mm and mm wafers  and lynx r  our core production platform for all mm applications to date 
also  we now have two fully supported core technologies cvd tungsten products and ald high k dielectric constant oxides  both available on lynx r and lynx gross profit margin in was of revenues compared to a gross profit margin of in although average selling prices in were slightly higher than in  overall gross margin was lower in due to two factors first  capacity variances were incurred due to our lower production volume  particularly in the fourth quarter  and fixed costs related to manufacturing and international service operations 
we partially addressed this capacity issue in october by laying off employees and implementing an across the board reduced work week 
we will continue to monitor our capacity utilization and take actions as required 
second  we incurred incremental manufacturing variances of approximately million  primarily attributable to the introduction of lynx  and excess inventory write offs of approximately  during the third quarter 
going forward  we expect gross margins to continuously improve with the increase in volume 
research and development r d expenses were million in representing of revenues compared to million in  representing of revenues 
the increase in r d expenses of million  between and  was primarily due to increased usage of outside consultants million  expenses related to the reconfiguration of demonstration equipment  and additional depreciation on research equipment 
in  we added significant capacity in our demonstration lab and are now able to turnaround customer requests for demos in to days compared to turnaround times of to days in we believe that our demonstration lab now has adequate capacity for the foreseeable future and we expect a significant reduction in r d expenses related to demonstration equipment in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  of revenues  compared to expenses of million  of revenues  in increases in salaries related to higher headcount  and severance expenses  were partially offset by reduced selling commissions  and by various cost cutting actions  including temporary salary reductions and shutdown periods  implemented in q of other expenses were  in compared to other income of  in expenses in were primarily due to interest expense on higher average outstanding debt 
provision for income taxes was  in compared to  in primarily reflecting the accrual for taxes in our korean and japanese subsidiaries 
we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against the tax benefit associated with the losses in our us and foreign subsidiaries 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of million and state net operating loss carry forwards of million 
compared with revenues in were million compared with revenues of million in  representing an increase of 
a total of systems were accepted by the customer in  and qualified for revenue recognition 
a total of systems that shipped in were not signed off and accepted by customers  and this revenue was deferred at december  export sales accounted for of revenue in compared with in revenues for of million  compared to million which reflect the net revenues applying the change in accounting principle related to revenue recognition  represents an increase of 
gross profit margin in was million  representing of revenues  compared with million or in costs of goods sold for reflecting the change in accounting principle were million and the gross profit was million or 
the gross margin was lower on higher sales volumes  and was attributed to lower margins due to competitive pricing pressures on our standard tungsten silicide products  and increased worldwide customer service and manufacturing expenses to support our sales growth in  including a new office in japan 
our gross profits have historically been affected by variations in average selling prices  configuration differences  changes in the mix of product sales  unit shipment levels  the level of foreign sales and competitive pricing pressures 
research and development expenses in were million compared with million in  representing an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses were in and in the increase in research and development expenses is attributable to investments in development programs for ald productization and films  our three mm system  new tungsten products  and continuous improvement programs for existing products 
these programs are essential in our efforts to broaden our customer base and penetrate new markets in both semiconductor and non semiconductor applications 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared with million in  representing an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in the million increase in was due primarily to increased investment in sales and marketing to support the revenue growth and shipment growth we experienced in  and focused efforts toward new customers and market segments 
we had other income net of  in compared with other income of  in other income in consisted of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains due to the strengthening of the korean won against the us dollar during the first half of  offset by foreign currency exchange losses incurred in the fourth quarter 
in  other income included interest income and foreign currency exchange gains 
we provided for income taxes of  in compared with  of income taxes in in both years  income taxes were related to income generated from our south korean subsidiary 
in  we recorded a non recurring charge of million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle due to the adoption of sab this amount represents the gross profit on systems that shipped during  but did not receive final customer acceptance during included in this number were systems and some upgrades  which had a total sales value of million 
in december  the company changed its accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales with an effective date of january  the company s selling arrangements generally involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product occurs after shipment and transfer of title 
as a result  effective january   to comply with the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 the company deferred recognition of revenue from such equipment sales until installation is complete and the product is accepted by the customer 
the company previously recognized revenue related to systems upon shipment 
a provision for the estimated future cost of system installation  warranty and commissions was recorded when revenue was recognized 
service revenue is recognized when service has been completed 
the cumulative effect in prior years of the change in accounting method was a charge of million or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  compared to million as of december  accounts receivable was million  a decrease of million from million as of december   as we were able to collect on most of our overdue receivables 
cash used by operating activities totaled million  and consisted primarily of net loss of million and decreases in deferred revenues of million  partially offset by depreciation of million and reductions in receivables of million and reductions in inventories of million 
inventory reductions were primarily related to improved supply chain management  decreases in inventory held at customer sites from million to million and to reductions in shipment backlog  which reduced from million at the end of december to million on december  financing activities provided cash of million for in may  we received approximately million of net proceeds from the sale of million shares of our common stock and warrants for million additional shares of our common stock 
additionally  we increased our net short term borrowings by million 
we incurred capital expenditures of million in these expenditures were primarily related to the continuing program of upgrading existing equipment in our development and applications laboratories to meet our most advanced system capabilities and specifications  especially for our ald processes 
this has improved our product and film development capabilities  and increased our customer demonstration capabilities  which is critical in the sales process 
our primary source of funds at december  consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents  and million of accounts receivable  most of which we have collected during the three months ending march  significant financing transactions completed since december  include the following on may   we sold  shares of our common stock  and warrants to purchase up to  of additional shares of common stock  for net proceeds of approximately million 
additional warrants were issued to burnham securities and wells fargo van kasper for their services as placement agents in the transaction  for an additional  shares of our common stock 
on december   we replaced the million line of credit with venture bank with a million line of credit from silicon valley bank 
the silicon valley bank agreement includes a domestic revolving line of credit of million  secured against domestic eligible receivables and a foreign line of credit of million  financed by exim bank  secured against foreign eligible receivables and inventory 
the initial term of the loan is months ending december  total availability under both lines at any given point in time is limited to million 
the interest rate for borrowings under both the domestic and foreign lines is prime plus per annum calculated on the basis of a day year 
the loan agreement is collateralized by a first priority perfected security interest in the company s assets and has a covenant requiring the company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million plus of consideration for subsequent equity issuances and of net income of future quarters 
the minimum tangible net worth requirement is reduced by any losses in a subsequent quarter  but will not be reduced to less than million 
at december   million was outstanding under this agreement and there were no additional funds available to borrow 
on january   we received gross proceeds of million under a secured loan with citicapital  a division of citigroup 
the loan is payable over months  accrues interest of per annum and is secured by two systems in our demonstration lab 
on january   the company sold  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to  of additional shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
on march   we amended our line of credit with silicon valley bank to increase the funds available under both lines of credit to million  to extend the initial term of the loan to months ending march  and to reset the covenant to million plus of consideration for equity issuances subsequent to march  a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows amounts in less than after total revolving year years years years silicon valley bank   operating leases  n a    as of february   our cash balance was million 
we believe that our existing working capital and credit lines will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the next months 
accordingly  these financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis 
however  we may need additional cash for financing our growth 
we are reviewing the possibility of procuring additional financing through bank credit lines  equipment leases and various equity based transactions 
there can be no assurance that any required additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and any additional debt financing  if available  may involve further restrictive covenants 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we believe the adoption of sfas no 
 to date has not had significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
we believe the adopting of sfas will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement applies to all entities 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of long lived assets  except for certain obligations of leases 
as used in this statement  a legal obligation is an obligation that a party is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law  stature  ordinance or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and provides further guidance regarding the accounting and disclosure of long lived assets 
the company is required to adopt sfas effective january  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors the risks described below are not the only risks that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by  and the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of those risks 
you should also refer to the other information and our financial statements included in this k report and the related information incorporated by reference into this k report 
we have experienced losses over the last few years and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability we have experienced losses of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we may not be able to attain or sustain consistent future revenue growth on an annual basis  or achieve and maintain consistent profitability on an annual basis 
substantially all of our net sales come from a small number of large customers historically  we have relied on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our net revenues 
for example  in samsung electronics company  ltd  read rite corporation  nec  infineon and scs accounted for    and of revenues  respectively 
in  samsung electronics company  ltd 
and micron technology  inc accounted for and of revenues  respectively 
in  samsung electronics company ltd 
and micron technology  inc accounted for and of revenues  respectively 
the semiconductor manufacturing industry generally consists of a limited number of larger companies 
consequently  we expect that a significant portion of our future product sales will continue to be concentrated within a limited number of customers  even though we are making progress in reducing the concentration of our reliance on customers through our strategy of product and customer diversification 
none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement with us requiring them to purchase our products 
in addition  sales to these customers may decrease in the future when they complete their current semiconductor equipment purchasing requirements 
if any of our customers were to encounter financial difficulties or become unable to continue to do business with us at or near current levels  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed 
customers may delay or cancel orders or may stop doing business with us for a number of reasons including customer departures from historical buying patterns  general market conditions  economic conditions  or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry or in the industries that manufacture products utilizing integrated circuits 
we are subject to risks beyond our control or influence and are highly dependent on our international sales  particularly sales in asian countries export sales accounted for approximately  and of our total net sales in  and  respectively 
net sales to our south korean based customers accounted for approximately  and of total net sales  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales  including sales to south korea  will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
as a result  a significant portion of our net sales will be subject to risks  including unexpected changes in law or regulatory requirements  exchange rate volatility  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  extended payment terms  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing our subsidiaries  difficulties in managing foreign subsidiary operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our foreign sales are primarily denominated in us dollars and we do not engage in hedging transactions 
as a result  our foreign sales are subject to the risks associated with unexpected changes in exchange rates  which could affect the price of our products 
in the past  turmoil in the asian financial markets resulted in dramatic currency devaluations  stock market declines  restriction of available credit and general financial weakness 
for example  prices fell dramatically in because integrated circuit manufacturers sold dynamic random access memory chips  called dram s  at less than cost in order to generate cash 
the cash shortfall caused asian semiconductor companies to defer or cancel investments in new production facilities  thereby reducing our anticipated sales of our semiconductor manufacturing equipment in asia in also during this time  the value of the won  the currency of south korea  declined significantly against the us dollar 
as a result  purchases of us manufactured products became very costly 
since most of our sales were made to south korean customers  these circumstances adversely impacted our customers ability to invest in new facilities and equipment that reduced our shipments and profitability in wherever currency devaluations occur abroad  our goods become more expensive for our customers in that region 
difficult economic conditions may limit capital spending by our customers 
these circumstances may also affect the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations  resulting in the cancellations or deferrals of existing orders and the limitation of additional orders 
our sales reflect the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  which could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly and could cause us to fail to achieve anticipated sales our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
although we are marketing our atomic layer deposition technology to non semiconductor markets such as markets in magnetic thin film heads  flat panel displays  micro electromechanical systems and inkjet printers  we are still dependent on the semiconductor market 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and experiences periodic downturns both of which reduce the semiconductor industry s demand for semiconductor manufacturing capital equipment 
semiconductor industry downturns have significantly decreased our revenues  operating margins and results of operations in the past 
during the industry downturn in  several of our customers delayed or cancelled investments in new manufacturing facilities and equipment due to declining dram prices  the asian economic downturn  and general softening of the semiconductor market 
this caused our sales in to be significantly lower than in the prior three years 
after the dramatic industry boom for semiconductor equipment that peaked early in the year  another cyclical downturn is presently occurring 
the sharp and severe industry downturn in was the largest in the industry s history 
almost all previous downturns have been solely due to pricing declines 
the downturn in the industry marked a corresponding decline in unit production 
genus recently reported a loss for our financial results 
there is a risk that our revenues and operating results will continue to be further impacted by the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry and global economy 
our future growth is dependent on acceptance of new thin films and market acceptance of our systems relating to those thin films we believe that our future growth will depend in large part upon the acceptance of our new thin films and processes  especially our atomic layer deposition technology 
as a result  we expect to continue to invest in research and development in these new thin films and the systems that use these films 
there can be no assurance that the market will accept our new products or that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a timely manner to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
the failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must manage product transitions successfully  as introductions of new products could harm sales of existing products 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of equipment used to chemically deposit tungsten silicide in the manufacture of memory chips 
we estimate that the life cycle for these tungsten silicide deposition systems is three to five years 
there is a risk that future technologies  processes or product developments may render our product offerings obsolete and we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner 
we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry against competitors with greater resources the semiconductor manufacturing capital equipment industry is highly competitive 
we face substantial competition throughout the world 
we believe that to remain competitive  we will require significant financial resources in order to develop new products  offer a broader range of products  establish and maintain customer service centers and invest in research and development 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources  more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing  customer service capabilities and greater name recognition 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics 
if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering thin film products similar to those sold by us  it would materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products to such manufacturers 
in addition  to expand our sales we must often replace the systems of our competitors or sell new systems to customers of our competitors 
our competitors may develop new or enhanced competitive products that will offer price or performance features that are superior to our systems 
our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their product lines 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our sales if our resources do not allow us to respond effectively to such competitive forces 
we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth if we are not selected as vendor of choice for new or expanded fabrication facilities and if our systems and products do not achieve broader market acceptance because semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor fabrication facility  these manufacturers will tend to choose semiconductor equipment manufacturers based on established relationships  product compatibility and proven financial performance 
once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular vendor s capital equipment  the manufacturer generally relies for a significant period of time upon equipment from this vendor of choice for the specific production line application 
to do otherwise creates risk for the manufacturer because the manufacture of a semiconductor requires many process steps and a fabrication facility will contain many different types of machines that must work cohesively to produce products that meet the customers specifications 
if any piece of equipment fails to perform as expected  the customer could incur significant costs related to defective products  production line downtime  or low production yields 
since most new fabrication facilities are similar to existing ones  semiconductor manufacturers tend to continue using equipment that has a proven track record 
based on our experience with major customers like samsung  we have observed that once a particular piece of equipment is selected from a vendor  the customer is likely to continue purchasing that same piece of equipment from the vendor for similar applications in the future 
our customer list  though limited  has expanded in recent months 
yet our broadening market share remains at risk to choices made by customers that continue to be influenced by pre existing installed bases by competing vendors 
a semiconductor manufacturer frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  we may face narrow windows of opportunity to be selected as the vendor of choice by potential new customers 
it may be difficult for us to sell to a particular customer for a significant period of time once that customer selects a competitor s product  and we may not be successful in obtaining broader acceptance of our systems and technology 
if we are not able to achieve broader market acceptance of our systems and technology  we may be unable to grow our business and our operating results and financial condition will be harmed 
our lengthy sales cycle increases our costs and reduces the predictability of our revenue sales of our systems depend upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity 
that decision typically involves a significant capital commitment by our customers 
accordingly  the purchase of our systems typically involves time consuming internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation and introduction of new technologies into our customers manufacturing facilities 
for many potential customers  an evaluation as to whether new semiconductor manufacturing equipment is needed typically occurs infrequently 
following an evaluation by the customer as to whether our systems meet its qualification criteria  we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future delays in finalizing system sales while the customer evaluates and receives approval for the purchase of our systems and constructs a new facility or expands an existing facility 
due to these factors  our systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle during which we may expend substantial funds and management effort 
the time between our first contact with a customer and the customer placing its first order typically lasts from nine to twelve months and is often longer 
this lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to accurately forecast future sales and may cause our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
if anticipated sales from a particular customer are not realized in a particular period due to this lengthy sales cycle  our operating results may be adversely affected for that period 
our intellectual property is important to us and we risk loss of a valuable asset  reduced market share and litigation expenses if we cannot adequately protect it 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
we currently have a number of united states and foreign patents and patent applications 
on august   we filed a counterclaim against asm international nv  charging asm with infringing genus us patent  entitled method of selective etching native oxide  and with committing antitrust violations designed to harm the atomic layer deposition market 
there can be no assurance that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted there under will provide us with competitive advantages 
if we are found to infringe the patents or intellectual property of other parties  our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 
from time to time  we may receive notices from third parties alleging infringement of patents or intellectual property rights 
it is our policy to respect all parties legitimate intellectual property rights  and we will defend against such claims or negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms where appropriate 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or that any litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
on june   asm america  inc asma filed a patent infringement action against genus  inc asma s complaint alleges that genus is directly and indirectly infringing us patent no 
 the patent  entitled sequential chemical vapor deposition  and us patent no 
 the patent entitles method for growing thin films  which asm claims to own or exclusively license 
the complaint seeks monetary and injunctive relief 
on august   genus filed a counterclaim against asma and asm international  nv asmi for infringement of nv patent no 
 the patent entitled method of selective etching native oxide and for antitrust violations 
genus also seeks a declaratory judgment that asma s claims regarding the and patents are invalid and unenforceable 
an initial case management conference was held on october  on january   the court issued an order granting asm leave to amend its complaint to add dr 
sherman as a party and to add a claim that genus is directly and indirectly infringing us patent no  the patent entitled apparatus for chemical vapor deposition using an axially symmetric gas flow  which asm claims to own 
the court also severed and stayed discovery regarding genus antitrust claims until after trial of the patent claims 
on february   genus filed for declaratory judgment on the grounds that asma s claims regarding the patent are invalid and unenforceable 
the claim construction hearings regarding these claims are set for june  for the and patents  june  for the patent  and september  for the patent 
we intend to defend our position vigorously 
the outcome of any litigation is uncertain  however  and we may not prevail 
should we be found to infringe any of the patents asserted  in addition to potential monetary damages and any injunctive relief granted  we would need either to obtain a license from asm to commercialize our products or redesign our products so they do not infringe any of these patents 
if we were unable to obtain a license or adopt a non infringing product design  we may not be able to proceed with development  manufacture and sale of our atomic layer products 
in this case our business may not develop as planned  and our results could materially suffer 
we are dependent upon key personnel who are employed at will  who would be difficult to replace and whose loss would impede our development and sales we are highly dependent on key personnel to manage our business  and their knowledge of business  management skills and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of dr 
william wr elder  our chairman and chief executive officer  dr 
thomas e 
seidel  our chief technology officer  and other key managerial and technical employees who would be difficult to replace 
the loss of dr 
elder or dr 
seidel or other key employees could limit or delay our ability to develop new products and adapt existing products to our customers evolving requirements and would also result in lost sales and diversion of management resources 
none of our executive officers are bound by a written employment agreement  and the relationships with our officers are at will 
because of competition for additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel  which could impede development or sales of our products 
our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
there is substantial competition for experienced engineering  technical  financial  sales and marketing personnel in our industry 
in particular  we must attract and retain highly skilled design and process engineers 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area where we are based 
if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel  or attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we may from time to time experience inadequate levels of staffing to develop and market our products and perform services for our customers 
as a result  our growth could be limited due to our lack of capacity to develop and market our products to customers  or fail to meet delivery commitments or experience deterioration in service levels or decreased customer satisfaction 
our failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in substantial liability to us we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment

we use the following regulated gases at our manufacturing facility in sunnyvale tungsten hexafluoride  dichlorosilane silicide  silane and nitrogen 
we also use regulated liquids such as hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid 
the city of sunnyvale  california  imposes high environmental standards to businesses operating within the city 
genus has met the city s stringent requirements and has received an operating license from sunnyvale 
presently  our compliance record indicates that our methods and practices successfully meet standards 
moving forward  if we fail to continuously maintain high standards to prevent the leakage of any toxins from our facilities into the environment  restrictions on our ability to expand or continue to operate our present locations could be imposed upon us or we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or incur other significant expenses 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for many components and subassemblies  and supply shortages or the loss of these suppliers could result in increased cost or delays in the manufacture and sale of our products components and sub assemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
disruption or termination of these sources could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we believe that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products  if necessary 
nevertheless  a prolonged inability to obtain components could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we depend upon six independent sales representatives for the sale of our products and any disruption in these relationships would adversely affect us we currently sell and support our thin film products through direct sales and customer support organizations in the us  europe  south korea and japan and through six independent sales representatives and distributors in the us  europe  south korea  taiwan  china and malaysia 
we do not have any long term contracts with our sales representatives and distributors 
any disruption or termination of our existing distributor relationships could negatively impact sales and revenue 
we established a direct sales organization in japan and we may not succeed in effectively penetrating the japanese marketplace we terminated our relationship with our distributor  innotech corp 
in japan in in  we invested significant resources in japan by establishing a direct sales organization  genus japan  inc although we continue to invest significant resources in our japan office and have received orders from two new japanese customers in  we may not be able to attract new customers in the japanese semiconductor industry  and as a result  we may fail to yield a profit or return on our investment in japan 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  which may lead to losses by investors or to securities litigation our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our  our competitors or our customers actual or anticipated financial results  our competitors or our customers announcements of technological innovations  revenue recognition policies  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and other events or factors 
also  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of many technology companies  in particular  and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic and political conditions in the united states and the countries in which we do business  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility in the company s stock price 
this type of litigation  if filed against us  could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
a disaster could severely damage our ability to deliver our products to our customers 
our products depend on our ability to maintain and protect our operating equipment and computer systems  which is primarily located in or near our principal headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
sunnyvale exists near a known earthquake fault zone 
although our facilities are designed to be fault tolerant  the systems are susceptible to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  and similar events 
although we maintain general business insurance against interruptions such as fires and floods  there can be no assurance that the amount of coverage will be adequate in any particular case

in the event that circumstances trigger the transferability and exercisability of rights granted in our preferred stock rights agreement  your current holdings in genus may decline as a result of dilution to your percentage ownership in genus or as a result of a reduction in the per share value of our stock resulting from the increase in the number of outstanding shares available

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as our business practices evolve and could seriously harm our financial results 
won denominated sales made by the south korean subsidiary for the year ended december  amounted to won billion  or million  sales for the year ended december  amounted to won billion  or million  and sales for the year ended december  amounted to won billion  or million 
sales made by the japanese subsidiary for the year ended december  amounted to yen million  or million 
there were no sales from our japanese subsidiary in and an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and  therefore  reduce the demand for our products 
reduced demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents or increase any interest expense owed on the line of credit facility 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rates exposures
