item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a healthcare services company focused on acquiring and operating hospitals in attractive non urban markets in the united states 
as of december   we owned or leased general acute care hospitals in eleven states with a total of  licensed beds  and managed hospitals in states with a total of  licensed beds 
impact of acquisitions and divestitures an integral part of our strategy is to acquire non urban acute care hospitals 
because of the financial impact of our recent acquisitions  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between our financial statements for the fiscal periods presented 
in addition  because of the relatively small number of owned and leased hospitals  each hospital acquisition can materially affect our overall operating performance 
upon the acquisition of a hospital  we typically take a number of steps to lower operating costs 
the impact of such actions may be offset by cost increases to expand services  strengthen medical staff and improve market position 
the benefits of these investments and of other activities to improve operating margins generally do not occur immediately 
consequently  the financial performance of a newly acquired hospital may adversely affect overall operating margins in the near term 
as we make additional hospital acquisitions  we expect that this effect will be mitigated by the expanded financial base of existing hospitals and the allocation of corporate overhead among a larger number of hospitals 
we may also divest certain hospitals in the future if we determine a hospital no longer fits within our strategy 
general the federal medicare program accounted for approximately  and of hospital patient days in   and  respectively 
the state medicaid programs accounted for approximately  and of hospital patient days in  and  respectively 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are prospective  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
the medicare payment rate increases historically have been less than actual inflation 
both federal and state legislatures are continuing to scrutinize the healthcare industry for the purpose of reducing healthcare costs 
while we are unable to predict what  if any  future healthcare reform legislation may be enacted at the federal or state level  we expect continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental healthcare programs 
the balanced budget act of imposed certain limitations on increases in the inpatient medicare rates paid to acute care hospitals 
payments for medicare outpatient services provided at acute care hospitals and home health services historically have been paid based on costs  subject to certain limits 
the balanced budget act of requires that the payment for those services be converted to a prospective payment system  which will be phased in over time 
the balanced budget act of also includes a managed care option that could direct medicare patients to managed care organizations 
the medicare  medicaid  and schip benefits improvement and protection act of bipa amended the balanced budget act of by giving hospitals a full market basket increase in fiscal years and in addition  bipa contains provisions delaying scheduled reductions in payment for home health agencies and other provisions designed to lessen the impact on providers of spending reductions contained in the balanced budget act of further changes in the medicare or medicaid programs and other proposals to limit healthcare spending could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry and our company 
some of our acute care hospitals  like most acute care hospitals in the united states  have significant unused capacity 
the result is substantial competition for patients and physicians 
inpatient utilization continues to be affected negatively by payor required pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
we expect increased competition and admission constraints to continue in the future 
the ability to respond successfully to these trends  as well as spending reductions in governmental healthcare programs  will play a significant role in determining the ability of our hospitals to maintain their current rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
we expect the industry trend towards the provision of more services on an outpatient basis to continue 
this trend is the result of increased focus on managed care and advances in technology 
the billing and collection of accounts receivable by hospitals are complicated by a number of factors  including the complexity of the medicare and medicaid regulations  increases in managed care  hospital personnel turnover  the dependence of hospitals on physician documentation of medical records  and the subjective judgment involved 
these factors  or any combination of them  may impact our ability to bill and collect our accounts receivable at the rates we have anticipated  which could negatively affect our future cash flows 
the federal government and a number of states are increasing the resources devoted to investigating allegations of fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
at the same time  regulatory and law enforcement authorities are taking an increasingly strict view of the requirements imposed on providers by the social security act and medicare and medicaid regulations 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with such laws  a determination that we have violated such laws  or even the public announcement that we were being investigated concerning possible violations  could have a material adverse effect on our company 
our historical financial trend has been impacted favorably by our success in acquiring acute care hospitals 
while we believe that trends in the healthcare industry described above may create future acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to maintain our current growth rate through hospital acquisitions and successfully integrate the hospitals into our system 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  information expressed as a percentage of net operating revenue 
such information has been derived from our consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this report 
the results of operations for the periods presented include hospitals from their acquisition dates  as previously discussed 
year ended december  net operating revenue operating expenses ebitda depreciation and amortization interest  net minority interest loss on sale income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income operating expenses represent expenses before interest  minority interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda represents the sum of income before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization and minority interest 
we understand that industry analysts consider ebitda to be one measure of the financial performance of a company that is presented to assist investors in analyzing the operating performance of a company and its ability to service debt 
we believe that an increase in ebitda level is an indicator of our improved ability to service existing debt  to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
given that ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
hospital revenues are received primarily from medicare  medicaid and commercial insurance 
the percentage of revenues received from the medicare program is expected to increase with the general aging of the population 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are based on a prospective payment system  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
while these rates are indexed for inflation annually  the increases historically have been less than actual inflation 
in addition  states  insurance companies and employers are actively negotiating the amounts paid to hospitals as opposed to paying standard hospital rates 
the trend toward managed care  including health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and various other forms of managed care  may affect the hospitals ability to maintain their current rate of net operating revenue growth 
net patient service revenue is reported net of contractual adjustments and policy discounts 
the adjustments principally result from differences between our hospitals customary charges and payment rates under the medicare  medicaid and other third party payor programs 
customary charges generally have increased at a faster rate than the rate of increase for medicare and medicaid payments 
operating expenses of our hospitals primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits  purchased services  supplies  provision for doubtful accounts  rentals and leases  and other operating expenses  principally consisting of utilities  insurance  property taxes  travel  freight  postage  telephone  advertising  repairs and maintenance 
other revenue is comprised of fees from management and professional consulting services provided to third party hospitals pursuant to management contracts and consulting arrangements  reimbursable expenses and miscellaneous other revenue items 
management and professional services revenue plus reimbursable expenses total less than of our consolidated net operating revenue 
operating expenses for the management and professional services business primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits and reimbursable expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
we divested two hospitals in the fourth quarter of  which prevents meaningful total revenue comparisons 
net patient service revenue generated by hospitals owned during both periods increased million  or  resulting from inpatient and outpatient volume increases  new services and price increases 
cost report settlements and the filing of cost reports resulted in negative revenue adjustments of million  or of net operating revenue  in  and a positive revenue adjustment of million  or of net revenues in the remaining increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of additional hospitals in and operating expenses increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase in operating expenses of hospitals owned during both periods resulted primarily from new services  volume increases  change in case mix and increased recruiting expenses 
ebitda increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue  in  primarily as a result of improved operations at hospitals owned during both periods 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in  to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from capital expenditures and the acquisitions in  and a full year of expense for acquisitions made in interest expense as a percent of net operating revenue decreased from in to in proceeds from the sale of convertible notes in november and december and in october were used to reduce the higher rate of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility

the consolidated provision for doubtful accounts increased to of net operating revenue in from of net operating revenue in  primarily related to two hospitals acquired in the majority of the increase in operating expenses was attributable to the acquisition of additional hospitals in and ebitda increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue  in depreciation and amortization expense increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from the acquisition of additional hospitals in and  and capital expenditures at hospitals owned during both periods 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
this was a result of increased borrowings to finance the acquisition of additional hospitals in and and higher interest rates  offset by the reduction in the revolving credit facility with the net proceeds of the common stock offering and the sale of convertible subordinated notes 
loss on sale of assets totaled million in  primarily as a result of a net loss of million on the sale of two hospitals and an office building 
we sold ojai valley community hospital in october at a loss of approximately million 
we sold general hospital in december for a gain of approximately million 
we sold an office building in december for a gain of approximately million 
the company does not expect future earnings to be impacted as a result of these sales 
income before provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million in  an increase of million or 
on a pro forma basis  adjusting actual net income to exclude the after tax effect of the sales of the two hospitals and the office building  net income for the year was million 
our provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million in these provisions reflect effective income tax rates of for  compared to for see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding differences between effective tax rates and statutory rates 
net income was million  or of net operating revenue  in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue  in liquidity and capital resources capital resources in april  we completed our public offering of  shares of common stock 
net proceeds from the offering of approximately million were used to reduce the balance of our revolving credit line 
in november and december   we sold million of convertible subordinated notes  due november  net proceeds of approximately million were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit 
the notes bear interest from november  at the rate of per year  payable semi annually on may and november  beginning on may  the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes on or after november   at the then current redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
note holders may require us to repurchase all of the holder s notes at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in some circumstances involving a change of control 
the notes are unsecured obligations and rank junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
the indenture does not contain any financial covenants 
a total of  shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance upon conversion of the notes 
in october  we sold million of convertible subordinated notes  due october  net proceeds of approximately million were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit and for acquisitions 
the notes bear interest from october  at the rate of per year  payable semi annually on april and october  beginning on april  the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes on or after october   at the then current redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
note holders may require us to repurchase all of the holder s notes at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in some circumstances involving a change of control 
the notes are unsecured and subordinated to our existing and future senior indebtedness and senior subordinated indebtedness 
the notes are ranked equal in right of payment to our notes due in the notes rank junior to our subsidiary liabilities 
the indenture does not contain any financial covenants 
a total of  shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance upon conversion of the notes 
total long term obligations  less current maturities  increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase resulted primarily from the sale of million of convertible notes in october in october  we reduced the size of our credit facility to million including a revolving line of credit of million and an end loaded lease facility of million 
at december   we had an outstanding letter of credit of million  no borrowings outstanding under our revolving line of credit and million available  which included availability under the end loaded lease facility that could be converted to revolver availability at our option 
we had contemplated financing the construction of a hospital and three medical office buildings using the end loaded lease facility agreement 
the properties were in the final stages of construction at december  given the current business environment  we made the decision to modify the terms of the end loaded lease facility to enable us to account for the properties and borrowings on the balance sheet 
in the first quarter of  we anticipate recording approximately million in property and equipment and long term debt on our balance sheet related to these projects 
we estimate that this financing decision will result in an additional annual expense  after tax  of approximately million 
this is the result of the difference between depreciation of the facilities and interest on the debt  as compared to the net rent expense that would have been incurred if the properties had been financed under the end loaded lease facility 
the loans under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at the adjusted base rate or at the adjusted libor rate 
the interest rate ranged from to during we pay a commitment fee  which varies from one half to three eighths of one percent of the unused portion  depending on compliance with certain financial ratios 
the principal amount outstanding under the revolving credit agreement may be prepaid at any time before the maturity date of may  the credit facility contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness including contingent obligations  sell material assets  retire  redeem or otherwise reacquire our capital stock  acquire the capital stock or assets of another business  and pay dividends 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain a specified net worth and meet or exceed certain coverage  leverage  and indebtedness ratios 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all assets of our company 
interest rate swap agreements are used to manage our interest rate exposure under our credit facility 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  that effectively converted for a five year period million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
in june  the counterparty exercised its option to terminate the swap agreement 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted for a five year period million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
we secured a fixed interest rate on the swap agreement 
cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december  working capital increased to million at december  from million at december   resulting primarily from increased business volumes  growth in accounts receivable from acquired hospitals  and effective management of our working capital 
our cash flows from operating activities increased by million from million provided in to million provided in offsetting our improved profitability was a large increase in accounts receivable  both at hospitals owned during both periods  resulting from volume increases  new services and price increases  and a build up of accounts receivable at newly acquired hospitals 
the use of our cash in investing activities increased from million in to million in  reflecting more acquisitions during our cash flows provided by financing activities increased million from million in  to million in  primarily because of increased borrowings related to acquisitions and the sale of convertible notes 
cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december working capital increased to million at december  from million at december   resulting primarily from increased business volumes and effective management of our working capital 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  our cash flows from operating activities increased by million from million in to million in offsetting our improved profitability were increases in accounts receivable and other assets 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from higher volumes at hospitals owned during both periods and acquired hospitals  as well as temporary delays in billing of medicare and medicaid accounts receivable while waiting for assignment of applicable third party provider numbers at those newly acquired hospitals 
the increase in other assets relates to income tax benefits resulting from employee exercises of non qualified stock options 
the use of our cash in investing activities decreased from million in to million in  resulting primarily from smaller outlays of cash for acquisitions and disposal of hospitals in  compared to our cash flows provided by financing activities decreased from million in to million in  resulting from reduced borrowings for acquisitions in  and the net effect of proceeds from a common stock offering and the sale of convertible debt used to pay down existing debt under our revolving credit agreement 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  in  and  were million  million  and million  respectively  inclusive of construction projects 
capital expenditures for our owned hospitals may vary from year to year depending on facility improvements and service enhancements undertaken by the hospitals 
we expect to make total capital expenditures in of approximately million  exclusive of any acquisitions of businesses or construction projects 
planned capital expenditures for consist principally of capital improvements to owned and leased hospitals 
we expect to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
if pre determined operating levels are achieved  we have agreed to build replacement facilities for eunice community medical center  currently expected to cost approximately million  and glades general hospital  currently expected to cost approximately million 
we do not know whether and when each hospital will achieve its individual pre determined operating levels  but we believe it will take approximately thirty six months to complete construction from such date 
we completed construction on an ancillary expansion at havasu regional medical center in  at a cost of approximately million 
in addition  in connection with certain acquisitions we have made  we have committed and may commit in the future to make specified capital expenditures 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates  and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts our ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payors is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately of the accounts receivable balance  net of contractual discounts  at december  the primary collection risk lies with uninsured patient accounts or patient accounts for which a balance remains after primary insurance has paid 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since patient discharge date 
the allowance for doubtful accounts increased  as a percentage of accounts receivable net of contractual adjustments  from in to in this increase primarily resulted from the timing of write off of accounts 
prior to  accounts were removed from the accounts receivable balance and sent to the collection agency when aged to days 
beginning in  the accounts were removed from the accounts receivable balance at the earlier of return from the agency or when aged to days 
we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collections data and other analytical tools to support the basis for our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payor mix or business office operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
allowance for contractual discounts the percentage of our patient service revenue derived from medicare and medicaid patients continues to be high 
for the year ended december   combined medicare and medicaid utilization was  based on a patient day calculation 
the medicare and medicaid contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our hospitals  and cost settlement provisions requiring complex calculations and assumptions subject to interpretation 
we estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis  given our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms 
we have invested significant human resources and information systems to improve the estimation process  however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently  necessitating our continual review and assessment of the estimation process 
general and professional liability reserves given the nature of our operating environment  we may become subject to medical malpractice or workers compensation claims or lawsuits 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  in we maintained insurance for individual malpractice claims exceeding  per medical incident  subject to an annual maximum of  and workers compensation claims exceeding  we estimate our self insured retention portion of the malpractice and workers compensation risks using historical claims data  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accrual for malpractice and workers compensation claims could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claims trends 
the estimation process is also complicated by the relatively short period of time in which we have owned some of our healthcare facilities  as occurrence data under previous ownership may not necessarily reflect occurrence data under our ownership 
while management monitors current claims closely and considers outcomes when estimating our insurance accruals  the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in the estimates 
medical claims reserves we maintain self insured medical and dental plans for employees 
claims are accrued under these plans as the incidents that give rise to them occur 
we use a third party administrator to process all such claims 
unpaid claim accruals are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settlement  including claim settlement expenses  in accordance with an average lag time and past experience 
we have entered into a reinsurance agreement with an independent insurance company to limit our losses on claims 
under the terms of this agreement  the insurance company will reimburse us a maximum of  on any individual claim 
while management believes that its estimation methodology effectively captures trends in medical claims costs  actual payments could differ significantly from our estimates  given changes in the healthcare cost structure or adverse experience 
recently issued accounting pronouncements effective january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we designated our outstanding interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge 
we determined that the current agreements are highly effective in offsetting the fair value changes in a portion of our debt 
these derivatives and the related hedged debt amounts have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements at their respective fair values 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
was effective july   and sfas no 
became effective january  under the new rules in sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized effective january   but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately million per share per year 
during  we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january   and have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on our earnings and financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  sfas no 
and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
removes goodwill from its scope and clarifies other implementation issues related to sfas no 
sfas no 
also provides a single framework for evaluating long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the provisions of this statement were adopted effective january  and had no material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase  especially during periods of inflation and labor shortages 
in addition  suppliers pass along to us rising costs in the form of higher prices 
we generally have been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing charges for services  expanding services  and implementing cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
in light of cost containment measures imposed by government agencies and private insurance companies  we do not know whether we will be able to offset or control future cost increases  or our ability to pass on the increased costs associated with providing healthcare services to patients with government or managed care payors  unless such payors correspondingly increase reimbursement rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
our primary market risk involves interest rate risk 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  we generally maintain of our debt at a fixed rate  either by borrowing on a long term basis or entering into an interest rate swap 
at december   of our outstanding debt was effectively at a fixed rate 
our interest rate swap contract allows us to periodically exchange fixed rate and floating rate payments over the life of the agreement 
floating rate payments are based on libor  and fixed rate payments are dependent upon market levels at the time the interest rate swap was consummated 
our interest rate swap is a cash flow hedge  which effectively converted an aggregate notional amount of million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings at december  our policy is not to hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes and to avoid derivatives with leverage features 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument 
we anticipate that the counterparty will fully satisfy its obligations under the contract 
the carrying amount of our total long term debt  less current maturities  of million and million at december  and  respectively  approximated fair value 
we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at december   with interest rate swaps in place to offset the variability of the entire balance in at the december  borrowing level  a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  considering the effect of the interest rate hedge agreement  would have no impact on our net income and cash flows 
a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates on the fixed rate debt would not have a material impact on the fair value of such debt
