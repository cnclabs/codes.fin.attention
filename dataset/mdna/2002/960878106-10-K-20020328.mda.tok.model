western energy company weco 
weco was acquired in april as part of the acquisition of the coal business of montana power 
weco operates the rosebud mine in colstrip  montana  a surface mine in the northern powder river basin 
the rosebud mine is one of the largest coal mines in the united states and sold  tons of subbituminous coal in  tons for the eight months since the acquisition 
after mining the coal  weco crushes it and sells it without further preparation 
weco s primary customers are the owners of the four unit  mine mouth colstrip station  which has a combined electric generating capacity of approximately  mw 
this coal is sold under long term contracts expiring in for colstrip units and and for colstrip units and the colstrip units and contract has a base price with escalating provisions for certain costs and the colstrip units and contract is a cost plus arrangement 
weco also supplies coal to minnesota power under an increasing fixed price coal supply agreement that expires in and to several smaller customers under contracts of varying term 
northwestern resources co 
nwr 
nwr was also acquired in april as part of the acquisition of the coal business of montana power 
nwr operates the jewett mine  located in central texas  and supplies surface mined lignite to the two electric generating units at the limestone electric generating station legs  located adjacent to the mine 
legs is owned by reliant energy  inc reliant 
the lignite is sold under a long term lignite supply agreement lsa that expires in beginning july   tonnages and price will be determined sequentially on an annual basis pursuant to a procedure under which nwr will commit the number of tons it wishes to supply and price will be determined according to a formula which estimates hypothetical value of powder river basin coal if delivered to the plant that year 
for the full year of  nwr sold  tons of lignite  tons for the eight months since wcc s acquisition under the lsa

wcco krc acquisition corporation savage 
savage was also formed in  to acquire other parts of the coal assets of knife river corporation 
savage operates the savage mine near sidney  montana 
this is a lignite surface mine and for the full year of  savage sold  tons  tons for the eight months since wcc s acquisition of lignite under a full requirements  base price with an escalating provision for certain costs contract with the nearby lewis and clark station 
this contract expires on december  the savage mine has provided lignite to the lewis and clark station for over years and the company expects that this contract will be renewed with prices and terms similar to those now in effect 
the mine also has a contract  expiring august   to provide lignite to holly sugar s nearby beet processing facility 
the following tables show  for each of the past five years  tons sold and revenues derived from mines that were  at the time of production  owned by the company 
the company had no export sales during the five year period ended december  year coal sales in tons in s coal revenues in dollars in s tonnage sold by the company pursuant to contracts calling for deliveries over a period longer than one year is considered a long term contract 
the table below presents the percentage of coal tonnage sold under long term contracts for the last five years page sales tonnage under long term contracts the following table presents estimated minimum total sales tonnage under existing long term contracts for the next five years from the company s existing mining operations 
the price for all future tonnage is subject to revision and adjustments based upon market prices  certain indices and or cost recovery 
projected sales tonnage under existing long term contracts s the weighted average price under existing long term contracts was in  in and in in  the company s three largest customers accounted for of its coal revenues

other acquisition assets 
in connection with the acquisitions  the company obtained ownership of basin resources  inc basin  northern central resources  inc north central  horizon coal services  inc 
horizon  and western syncoal llc syncoal 
basin is a coal mining company that operated the golden eagle mine in trinidad  colorado and was part of montana power 
basin ceased operations in and is inactive 
westmoreland is seeking to dispose of its assets and obligations 
north central holds the land and water rights associated with the mining operations of basin 
horizon s only asset is a royalty interest in coal reserves located in campbell county  wyoming at the caballo mine owned by peabody energy 
the royalty covers million tons of coal mined at the rate of 
per ton  making the gross royalty amount  the latest mine plan delivered to horizon by peabody energy in march indicates that mining of this lease will begin in syncoal is a synthetic coal production facility located in colstrip  montana and is inactive 
in addition  wcc acquired knife river corporation s right to develop the lignite deposits at gascoyne  north dakota 
page independent power operations westmoreland energy  inc wei owns and manages interests in independent power projects 
wei  through various subsidiaries  currently has interests in three such power projects  all of which are operational 
each project has a single power purchaser and steam host 
the company is scheduled to receive distributions from its rova plants in january and july of each year 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning wei  including specific project operational statistics 
wei s independent power projects sell electricity through long term power sales contracts to utilities 
there are three types of independent power projects cogeneration projects which provide two types of useful energy eg  electricity and thermal energy  like steam sequentially from a single primary fuel eg  coal  small power producers which utilize waste  biomass or other renewable resources as fuel  and exempt wholesale generators ewg which provide electrical energy without the requirement to sell thermal energy or use waste or renewable resources as fuel sources 
wei has invested in cogeneration projects and in projects that are ewgs 
for wei  the key elements of an independent power project are a long term contract for the sale of electricity  long term contracts for the fuel supply  a suitable site  required permits and project financing 
cogeneration projects require another long term contract for the sale of the steam or other thermal energy 
the economic benefits of cogeneration can be substantial because  in addition to generating electricity  a significant portion of the energy is used to produce steam or high temperature water thermal energy for industrial processes 
electricity is sold to utilities and  in certain situations  to end users of electrical power  including large industrial facilities 
thermal energy from the cogeneration plant is sold to commercial enterprises and other institutions 
large industrial users of thermal energy include plants in the chemical processing  petroleum refining  food processing  pharmaceutical  pulp and paper industries 
westmoreland power  inc wpi was formed to acquire certain rights from knife river corporation and to pursue new independent power development 
on february   it announced that it had submitted a proposal to develop  own and operate  either independently or in partnership  a new state of the art mw lignite fired power plant near gascoyne  north dakota in connection with lignite vision lv 
wcc acquired the right to develop the lignite deposits at gascoyne from knife river corporation 
lv is a partnership between the state of north dakota and the lignite energy council lec that is administered by the industrial commission of north dakota and is designed to encourage construction of a new baseload power plant in north dakota 
project proposals were also submitted by mdu resources group  inc mdu  great river energy and great northern properties 
mdu and wpi have joined together to pursue development of a new lignite fired generation unit near gascoyne  north dakota and executed a joint development agreement 
on september   the industrial commission approved the joint mdu wpi project and awarded up to million in matching funds to facilitate feasibility and various technical studies after approval of the joint project wpi and mdu each own a interest in the project 
page terminal operations westmoreland terminal company  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  owns a interest in dominion terminal associates dta  the owner of a coal storage and vessel loading facility in newport news  virginia 
the company leases ground storage space and vessel loading capacity and facilities to others and provides related support services 
dta s annual throughput capacity is  tons  with a ground storage capacity of  tons 
dta loaded   and  tons in  and  respectively 
the company s portion of these tons was   and  in  and  respectively 
other operations the company idled the virginia division in and completed the sale of substantially all its assets by no tons were shipped from the virginia division during  or asset sales in resulted in proceeds  before selling costs  of approximately  there were no asset sales during or the company is in the process of selling the bullitt refuse area  the last of the virginia division assets the company now owns 
the refuse area has no recorded value 
an application to transfer the refuse area permit to the buyer was filed with the virginia division of mine land reclamation in february refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s business segments 
general employees and labor relations the company  including subsidiaries  directly employed people on december   compared with people on december  the company and basin were parties to separate and distinct wage agreements with the united mine workers of america umwa  which were effective december  the agreement and expired on august  the company is not a party to any subsequent wage agreement with the umwa  however  weco is a party to an agreement with local of the international union of operating engineers iuoe and dwc and savage assumed agreements with local of the umwa and local of the iuoe  respectively  when the coal assets were purchased from knife river corporation 
competition the coal industry is highly competitive 
the company competes principally on price and quality of coal with other coal producers of various sizes 
however  the company has a transportation advantage where its mines are located adjacent to its customers power plants 
the company s production accounted for less than of coal production in the united states in coal fired generation was responsible for approximately of all electricity generated within the united states in page the company s steam coal production also competes with other energy sources in the production of electricity 
factors such as the price of natural gas and the cost of environmental compliance will be major considerations in the decision to operate or build and bring on line substantial new coal fired generation 
the price of natural gas has been volatile over the past year ranging from a high of per mmbtu in february to a low of per mmbtu in november making the relative price stability in the coal market a significant contributor to renewed interest in constructing new  more environmentally friendly coal fired generation 
the company also generates electricity directly from projects in which wei owns an interest  and sells it on a wholesale long term contract basis to utilities under rates established in power purchase agreements and approved by regulatory agencies 
the independent power industry has grown rapidly over the past twenty years  accelerating in the s due  in part  to electric utility deregulation initiatives 
in the initial years following implementation of deregulation  prices for electricity were quite competitive in some states as a result of low fuel prices and a relatively high level of surplus capacity 
increasing energy demand  volatile fuel prices  and the failure of growth in generating capacity to keep pace with the increase in demand for power converged in to result in power shortages and higher electricity prices in many parts of the country 
this helped create renewed interest in coal fired capacity and more than  megawatts of planned additions had been announced as of december the principal sources of competition in this market include traditional regulated utilities seeking to maximize utilization of existing capacity  unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities  energy brokers and traders  energy service companies in the business of developing  operating  and marketing energy producing projects  equipment suppliers and other non utility generators like wei and wpi 
competition in this industry is substantially based on price 
the lowest cost generating units will be the most competitive in the market place and will run more frequently 
new generating capacity must compete today on a unit per kilowatt basis and be capable of complying with stringent environmental regulations 
westmoreland terminal company is subject to competition from both domestic and international providers of coal transloading services 
a significant portion of the coal shipped from dta is exported to foreign locations 
coal suppliers from australia  south africa  china  indonesia and a number of other foreign locations provide similar services 
mining safety and health westmoreland places the safety of its employees above all else and has an active safety and education program at every operation 
nwr had worked over the last sixteen months in excess of  man hours without a lost time accident before experiencing a minor accident in february the company s mining operations are subject to state and federal legislation including the federal coal mine safety and health act of and the amendments thereto  which prescribes mining health and safety standards 
in addition to authorizing fines and other penalties for violations  the act empowers the mine safety and health administration to suspend or halt offending operations 
page energy regulation the highly publicized california energy crisis sparked renewed interest in a national energy policy based on a multi pronged strategy involving energy efficiency and conservation  and maximizing domestic resources 
increased coal utilization and additional federal funding for clean coal research and technologies are prominently featured in the national energy policy debate 
as a direct consequence  interest in building new coal fired generation has increased 
many new generating facilities  including the company s potential lv project  have been publicly announced 
at both the national and state level  the debate about deregulation of electricity and the creation of competitive markets for wholesale and retail sale of electricity have continued 
while events in california during  including rolling blackouts and extreme market fluctuations in energy prices  have influenced the debate  many states and the federal government continue to consider creating competitive wholesale and retail power markets 
system reliability and transmission issues  including wheeling power from one system to another and system constraints insufficient line capacity to add new electricity  are among the factors being analyzed and the pace at which these problems are solved will affect how quickly competitive power markets may become a reality 
enron s recent failure will likely cause the move to unrestricted market competition to slow even more 
the public debate once again includes reference to regulatory concepts like fair and reasonable rates for not only transmission of electricity but also generation of electricity wei s rova i and rova ii generating units are located in weldon  north carolina 
these facilities are ewgs 
ewg status allows the rova facilities to operate with certain exemptions from federal and state regulation 
pursuant to the provisions of the national energy policy act of  an ewg can provide power without the requirement that it also sell thermal energy as a qualifying facility qf must 
an ewg can be a qf as defined in the public utilities regulatory policies act of but is not required to maintain qf status 
ewgs that are not qfs must have rates approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
both rova i and rova ii have rates approved by ferc 
protection of the environment mining operations 
the company believes its mining operations are in compliance with applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to surface mining and reclamation  and it is the policy of the company to operate in compliance with such standards 
the company maintains compliance primarily through the performance of reclamation  maintenance and monitoring activities 
utilization of coal to generate electricity produces certain by products  the emission of which is subject to federal regulation 
depending on coal purity and the combustion process  the emission by products may include nitrogen oxide  sulfur dioxide  carbon dioxide and mercury 
emission levels vary among generating units 
the newer an electric generating unit  the fewer emissions are produced in the combustion process 
clean air act in  certain amendments to the clean air act amendments were enacted 
as the first major revisions to the clean air act since  the amendments vastly expanded the scope of federal regulations and enforcement in several significant respects 
in particular  the amendments required that the united states environmental protection agency epa consider or issue new regulations related to ozone non attainment  air toxics and acid rain 
phase i of the acid rain provisions required  among other things  that certain electric utility power plants reduce their sulfur dioxide so emissions to effectively less than pounds per million btu by january  phase ii required essentially all utility power plants to reduce emissions to effectively less than pounds per million btu by january  the amendments allow utilities the freedom to choose the manner in which they will achieve compliance with the required emission standards 
recently  both the epa and congress have become more focused on promulgating some type of air toxics regulation 
all coal fired generating plants could be impacted by such regulations 
the company cannot currently determine the effect of such proposed regulations or the clear skies and global climate change initiatives on its operations 
page clear skies and global climate change initiatives on february   president bush announced two major initiatives 
the clear skies initiative proposes cuts in power plant emissions of nitrogen oxides nox  sulfur dioxide nox and mercury 
under the president s plan  so emissions will be reduced from current levels of approximately million tons to a cap of million tons in and million tons in nox emissions will be reduced by from current levels of approximately million tons to a cap of million tons in and million tons in mercury emissions will be reduced by from current levels of approximately millions to a cap of million tons in and then to million tons in this policy initiative envisions use of an emissions permit limit program modeled after the clean air act acid rain program and encourages use of new and cleaner pollution control technology 
all coal fired generating plants could be impacted by president bush s or a similar proposal 
the company cannot currently determine the effect of the clear skies initiative on its operations 
president bush also unveiled his global climate change initiative  which calls for a cut in greenhouse gas intensity by over the next ten years 
greenhouse gas intensity is the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to economic output 
the global climate change initiative seeks to lower the united states rate of emissions from an estimated metric tons to metric tons per million dollars of gross domestic product 
the global climate change initiative is comparable to the average progress that nations participating in the kyoto protocol are required to achieve 
state initiatives state specific environmental legislation may impact company operations 
for example  texas has passed new regulations requiring all fossil fuel fired generating facilities in the state to reduce nox emissions to pounds per million btu on an annual average basis beginning in may the texas nox regulations may impact lignite usage at legs 
see item  managements discussion and analysis  for more information 
other states are evaluating various strategies for improving air quality and reducing emissions 
passage of other state specific environmental laws may further affect the company s operations 
the company is monitoring events and issues to evaluate the effects of any new environmental law or regulations 
page mine reclamation as of december   the company has reclamation bonds in place in montana  north dakota  texas  and virginia to assure that operations comply with all applicable regulations and to assure the completion of final reclamation activities 
the amount of the bonds exceeds the estimated cost of final reclamation of  final reclamation obligations estimated to cost million at the jewett mine are the responsibility of its customer  reliant  which has posted a reclamation bond for that amount 
at the rosebud and absaloka mines  certain customers and wri s contract miner are obligated to either perform or reimburse the company for certain reclamation activities as they are performed 
these reclamation activities are estimated to cost approximately  as of december   wml had  in cash escrowed and invested to use for future reclamation activities at the rosebud mine  which activities are estimated to cost approximately  and will be performed through approximately reclamation of the bullitt refuse area continues to be deferred as the permit transfer application in connection with the company s proposed sale of the area to a local operation is being evaluated by the virginia division of mined land reclamation 
the estimated cost of approximately  to reclaim this site has been accrued 
independent power 
the environmental laws and regulations applicable to the projects in which wei and wpi may or do participate primarily involve the discharge of emissions into the water and air  but can also include waste disposal  wetlands preservation and noise regulation 
these laws and regulations in many cases require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining licenses  permits and approvals from federal  state and local agencies 
meeting the requirements of each jurisdiction with authority over a project can delay or sometimes prevent the completion of a proposed project  as well as require extensive modifications to existing projects 
the partnerships that own the projects in which wei has an interest and the partnership through which wpi and mdu are pursuing the lv project have the primary responsibility for obtaining the required permits and complying with the relevant environmental laws 
on december   the epa issued a section rule calling for combined no 
x 
reductions of  tons during each annual ozone season may september from certain named power stations in the eastern us  including rova i and ii 
the additional no 
x 
reductions were to begin in the rule responds to petitions filed by several northeastern states under clean air act section and seeks to control upwind nox emissions which the petitioning states allege prevent them from attaining the one hour ambient air quality standard 
ppm for ozone 
the rulemaking approach is an alternative to regional nox reductions called for in the epa nox state implementation plan call which was challenged by industry groups 
one of the most significant differences between the no 
x 
sip call and the section rule is that under the section rule  the epa regulates the individual source directly 
each source is assigned an emissions allocation 
the baseline for nox emissions allocations is the average of the highest date for any two years in the period 
allocation budgets will be updated in five year increments and the epa will inform sources of their allocations three years in advance 
initial allocations for the rova projects beginning in were published in the december  epa rule 
page on may   the us court of appeals for the us circuit upheld the majority of the epa s section rule but required certain additional justification from the epa on factors to be used in estimating utilization in the court s decision had the effect of suspending the epa s effort to impose controls on named sources 
the company expects that after the epa submits the information that the court has requested  implementation of the section rule will resume 
at this time  the independent power projects in which the company owns an interest are evaluating strategies for complying with the section rule 
in  the rova project partnership installed neural networks in the boilers 
the neural network increases boiler efficiency and reduces nox and carbon monoxide co emissions 
while the neural network reduces the level of nox and co emissions from the rova i and rova ii power plants  the rova project partnership is evaluating additional compliance strategies  including emission trading 
replacement or upgrades to rova s continuous emission monitoring cem system are being evaluated 
dominion terminal associates 
dta is responsible for complying with certain state and federal environmental laws and regulations  particularly those affecting air and water quality 
dta has employees on its staff who are responsible for assuring that it is in compliance 
in the event that dta failed to comply  the company could be responsible for a share of any expense incurred 
seasonality the demand for the power produced by the generating units that are supplied by the company s mines and owned by the independent power projects in which the company holds an interest tend to be higher in the winter and summer months and lower in the spring and fall months 
while all of these generating units are base loaded  the demand for their power may also be affected by maintenance outages 
foreign and domestic operations and export sales the company s assets and operations are  and for each of the last three years have been  located entirely within the united states 
there have been no export sales during the last three years 
item properties as of december   the company owned or leased coal properties located in montana  texas  north dakota  and virginia 
the properties contain coal reserves and coal deposits 
a coal reserve is that part of a mineral deposit that could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
the company includes in coal reserves  tons that are not fully permitted but that otherwise meet the definition of coal reserves 
a description of the permitting process and the company s assessment of that process as applied to these  tons follows the table below 
a coal deposit is a coal bearing body which has been appropriately sampled and analyzed in trenches  outcrops  and drilling to support sufficient tonnage and grade to warrant further exploration stage work 
this coal does not qualify as a coal reserve until  among other things  a final comprehensive evaluation based upon unit cost per ton  recoverability  and other material factors conclude legal and economic feasibility 
page the following table shows the location of the company s estimated coal reserves  coal deposits  production in and other mine information 
all of the coal is used in steam boilers to produce electricity

probable reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation

wri s total cost for the foregoing mine facilities incurred through is approximately  the company anticipates spending an additional  no later than to permit an additional mining area within its present mine plan 
wri does not believe additional exploration or development of this area is necessary other than obtaining future mining permits 
the first unit train coal shipment was loaded july  initially  coal was produced from the rosebud mckay and robinson coal seams  attempts were also made to recover coal from two thin rider seams identified as the stray and stray the stray is in the overburden to feet above the rosebud 
it is of erratic structure and quality  and for this reason initial efforts to recover a marketable product were unsuccessful  and it has been excavated as overburden 
the stray underlies the rosebud mckay by one to six feet 
the stray is relatively high in ash and sulfur  and for several years it was blended with the primary seams 
such blending resulted in erratic quality  and it was abandoned in the robinson coal underlies the rosebud mckay coal by to feet 
in  wri began supplying coal to a new generating unit designed by its customers to burn coal from the absaloka mine  but almost immediately severe slagging problems were encountered 
the problem was traced to coal from the robinson seam 
the plant owners notified wri that they would no longer accept robinson coal  and consequently  mining of the robinson seam was discontinued in hence  the only seam now being mined is the rosebud mckay seam  which is actually two seams separated by a thin parting ranging in thickness from a few inches to several feet 
the total aggregate coal thickness in the rosebud and mckay seams averages feet 
the coal is subbituminous c grade with an average heating value of  btu lb 
and percent sulfur as received 
all coal reserves and coal deposits shown in the previous table in the column captioned absaloka mine are leased by wri from the crow tribe of indians to exhaustion of the mineable and merchantable coal 
wri is evaluating the acquisition of the rights to additional reserves or deposits contiguous to its existing leases 
the company believes that all such deposits and reserves are recoverable through existing facilities with current technology and the company s existing infrastructure 
these reserves and deposits were estimated to be  tons as of january   based principally upon a report by intrasearch  inc  an independent firm of consulting geologists  prepared in february estimated remaining tons are reduced annually by production in the rosebud mckay seam and by the amount of coal in the robinson  stray and stray seams bypassed after mining the rosebud mckay seam 
through  approximately  tons of coal have been shipped to customers  primarily in the upper midwest for use as steam coal 
transportation is arranged and charges are paid by wri s customers 
there have been no significant problems with operation of the coal handling plant 
the only significant operating problem has been spoil stability in high overburden areas 
page the mining and reclamation permit application process operates under regulations of the office of surface mining osm and the state of montana under its osm approved program 
among the requirements are detailed pre mining inventories of environmental resources including soils  vegetation  wildlife  hydrology and archaeology 
the application must include detailed plans for mining  reclamation and protection of hydrological resources 
the process includes an exhaustive review of the application for compliance with all applicable regulations 
after initial review of the application  the regulatory authority issues a letter reviewing deficiencies in the application to which the applicant responds by revising the application where appropriate 
this process of identifying and responding to deficiencies is repeated until all matters are cleared 
the decision document and environmental assessment are subject to formal public review  including public hearings if requested 
the process typically takes two to four years from the time the initial application is filed 
a total of  acres have been disturbed by mining 
reclamation is complete on  acres  with the balance involved in active mining operations 
the reclamation bond  which is posted by wri and is an estimate by the montana department of environmental quality of total cost to reclaim  is  however  except for a small percentage funded by wri  washington group is contractually responsible for reclaiming the property  whatever the cost 
after reclamation is complete  wri is responsible for maintaining and monitoring the reclaimed property until the bond is released 
for the property mined through december   wri s estimated future cost of maintaining and monitoring such property prior to bond release is approximately  to  wri has chosen not to permit all of the coal reserves in its mine plan because it already has sufficient permitted coal to meet production  given the current rate of mining and demand  through it is anticipated that an application covering an estimated million tons of unpermitted reserves will be filed in the first half of based upon the company s current knowledge of the permitting process and the nature of these reserves  the company believes that there are no matters that would hinder its ability to obtain this mining permit on a timely basis 
rosebud mine weco was acquired by wml on april  rosebud mine coal comes from the rosebud seam in the montana portion of a much larger deposit commonly identified as the powder river basin 
the rosebud mine is an open pit or surface mine  weco uses four draglines in a single pass system to uncover one seam of coal 
there are three cubic yard capacity draglines purchased in  and and one cubic yard dragline purchased in the draglines use electric power purchased from montana power under standard individual tariffs 
the machines operate primarily on the highwall side of the pit with an extended bench that is developed by large production tractors 
coal is excavated from the seam using to cubic yard electric shovels and loaded on to ton bottom dump trucks 
the trucks haul the coal to one of three crushing facilities where it is loaded directly on conveyors and transported to the four colstrip units 
both the overburden and coal are drilled and blasted prior to excavation 
other equipment used at the rosebud mine includes overburden and coal drills  dozers  water wagons  motor blades  front end loaders  scrapers and numerous support equipment including service trucks  pumps and cranes 
the rosebud mine has multiple maintenance and support facilities and administration buildings 
the mine work force is represented by local of the iuoe 
the burlington northern santa fe railroad transports production to rail served customers 
the rosebud mine is equipped with a loop track and tipple facility capable of loading unit trains at the rate of  tons per hour 
page the rosebud mine is located at colstrip  montana  miles east of billings 
the northern pacific railroad began mining coal for its steam locomotives at colstrip in the railroad produced approximately million tons of coal from these reserves before adapting to diesel locomotives in in  montana power purchased the coal leases  mining machinery and colstrip town site to produce coal for future thermal generating plants  and for sale to others 
the total cost of the mine incurred through is approximately  weco was formed as a wholly owned montana power subsidiary in to operate the rosebud mine 
initial production was shipped to montana power s corette plant at billings  and to utilities and municipalities in the upper midwest 
major coal supply contracts were signed with two upper midwest utilities in the early s and in contracts were finalized for two new mw mine mouth generating plants at colstrip 
these long term contracts provided the foundation for a major expansion of the rosebud mine 
the mine s production of million tons of coal in steadily grew to million tons in the rosebud mine has consistently ranked among the largest single coal mines in the nation  based on annual production 
all coal reserves and coal deposits shown in the foregoing table in the column captioned rosebud mine are in montana and leased by weco from the federal government  great northern properties  or the state of montana 
the royalty payable under federal leases adjusts every ten years  and the leases remain in effect as long as minimum commercial quantities of coal are mined 
weco annually mines at least the minimum tonnages required to keep the leases current 
great northern leases were renewed in for a term of years  and the royalty payable under these leases adjusts every five years 
the state leases remain current as long as commercial quantities are produced or as long as they are under a valid mining permit 
these reserves and deposits were estimated to be  tons as of january   based principally upon a reserve study prepared for a logical mining unit application to the bureau of land management 
this reserve study was prepared by the environmental and engineering department of weco while it was owned by montana power 
the coal consists exclusively of the rosebud seam 
in  weco successfully bid on an additional  tons of federal coal and these reserves were added 
the company believes that all held deposits and reserves are recoverable through existing facilities at the rosebud mine with current technology and the company s existing infrastructure 
the coal has an average heating value of  btu lb 
and percent sulfur as received 
through  approximately  tons of coal have been produced and shipped from the rosebud mine to the colstrip power plants and utility customers in billings  montana and the upper midwest for use as steam coal

weco has chosen not to permit all of the coal reserves in its mine plan because it already has sufficient coal in its current permitted mine plan given the current rate of mining and demand for its production  through based upon the company s current knowledge of the permitting process and the nature of remaining reserves  the company believes that there are no matters that would hinder its ability to obtain additional mining permits in the future 
jewett mine nwr owns and leases coal properties for the jewett mine  an open pit mine in east texas  approximately half way between dallas and houston west of interstate highway the properties are located in leon  freestone  and limestone counties and are accessed on farm to market road the surface and coal leases for the jewett mine are all under private ownership 
most leases are for a term of to years although a few extend to years 
the term of the primary leases expire from to but are renewable if coal production is being done in the required radius area 
the jewett mine was developed pursuant to an agreement with reliant formerly houston lighting and power calling for production of the most economic  tons from the project area to supply the nearby legs 
the coal deposit was evaluated through a series of exploration programs  including physical and chemical analysis  according to those criteria 
as of december   a total of  tons have been produced and sold leaving  tons remaining 
the company believes that all such reserves are recoverable through existing facilities and with the company s existing infrastructure 
mine facilities consist of a truck dump  crusher  conveyors  coal storage  shop warehouse complex  administrative support buildings  and water treatment facilities 
the contract with reliant requires that all equipment and facilities be maintained such that they continue to be serviceable and support production comparable to the original specifications 
total capital cost to develop the mine was approximately  as of december  page overburden removal is scheduled hours per day  days per week 
where total overburden thickness exceeds feet  trucks and loaders are utilized to prebench to a foot level 
draglines then work to expose the lignite seams 
depending on overburden depths and seam geometry  the dragline may take as many as two highwall passes and three spoilside passes to complete a pit 
pit widths vary from to feet with a foot pit being normal 
overburden depths vary from to feet 
when the draglines cannot uncover sufficient lignite to meet fuel deliveries  additional prebenching below the aforementioned feet level is required 
this reduces the amount of dragline overburden  thus increasing lignite release 
the bes system operates in a single mine area to reduce the dragline overburden to a predetermined depth 
once the lignite is exposed it is removed utilizing backhoes  front end loaders  and ton bottom dump coal haulers 
the lignite seams vary in thickness from feet to feet 
the coal haulers transport the lignite to the coal handling facilities where it is crushed and delivered to the power plant by means of a conveyor belt 
the mine has been in continuous operation by nwr since and consists of four active areas with as many as four lignite seams within each area 
lignite is a dark brown to black combustible mineral formed over millions of years by the partial decomposition of plant material subject to increased pressure and temperature in an airless atmosphere 
lignite is coal with a lower grade and btu value 
because of its lower heat value  lignite typically can serve only contiguous power generating units 
overburden removal is accomplished with four draglines  a bucketwheel excavator system and or a truck and shovel fleet 
the primary excavating machines consist of three walking draglines with bucket capacities of cubic yards  one walking dragline with a bucket capacity of cubic yards  and one around the pit bucketwheel excavator system bes 
additional mobile equipment consists of dozers  scrapers  end dump trucks  bottom dump trucks  front end loaders  and backhoes 
the aforementioned equipment is owned by reliant and is leased by nwr on an annual basis 
electrical power for the facilities and major stripping equipment is generated by the brazos river authority and transferred to the mine site by navasota valley electric cooperative 
the first ton of coal from the jewett mine was sold in july the four primary seams are named the    and seams 
interburden ranging from one foot to feet in thickness separates them 
the total aggregate coal thickness from all four seams is approximately feet 
all of the coal mined from the jewett mine is shipped approximately one mile  via conveyor  from the crushing facility located at the mine to legs 
the lignite has an average heating value of  btu lb 
and percent sulfur as received 
initially  the mine operated with the three marion walking draglines 
in  due to increased overburden depth  the bes was put into operation 
in  due to increased depth of overburden and increased delivery demands by legs  a fourth dragline  the marion  was put into operation 
on average  the mine has sold million tons of coal per year for years 
exploration work for the project area was initiated in the late s  and initial reserve estimates were prepared by nwr engineers and geologists while nwr was owned by montana power 
nwr engineers and geologists initially estimated the coal deposits and reserves 
to further define the coal reserve  exploration drilling was utilized to delineate that part of the deposit that met an economic depth and strip ratio 
based on the economic depth and strip ratio  coring was conducted on foot centers and then on foot centers to develop the proven reserves 
core samples were taken on foot centers and were analyzed for physical and chemical parameters 
electronic logs were taken on foot centers 
additional drilling was conducted to further define the limits of the coal seams 
as of december   all planned exploration is complete for the life of mine coal reserve 
page reclamation activities follow mining 
the dragline spoils are regraded to an approximate original contour and are covered with a minimum of four feet of suitable plant growth material 
the area is then seeded and mulched 
to date  the mine has regraded and revegetated  acres  at any given time there are approximately to acres disturbed in association with the pit  prebench and unregraded spoil 
the reclamation bond  which is posted by nwr and by a reliant self bond  exceeds the total estimated cost to reclaim the mine 
under the current contract with reliant  nwr performs the reclamation work and the cost is passed through to reliant 
this will change in june so that nwr will perform the reclamation work on current mining including final pits in each area as part of its cost of mining 
final reclamation of the jewett mine  at the end of its useful life  is the financial responsibility of reliant 
the surface coal mine permitting process is regulated by the railroad commission of texas rct under its osm approved program 
some of the information required for permitting includes detailed premining inventories of environmental resources including soils  vegetation  wildlife  hydrology and archaeology 
the application must include detailed plans for mining  reclamation and protection of hydrological resources 
the permit preparation process takes in excess of a year 
the regulatory review and approval process includes an exhaustive review of the application for compliance with all applicable regulations

pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement the seller had days after the transaction closed to provide westmoreland a certificate setting forth the seller s calculation of the net assets of the entities that the company was acquiring and the net revenues of those entities through the closing date 
westmoreland then had days to agree or object to the seller s certificate 
entech and montana power submitted a certificate that would have increased the purchase price by approximately million 
the company submitted its own adjustments which would result in a substantial decrease in the original purchase price and objected to entech s and montana power s certificate 
under the stock purchase agreement  the parties had days from the submission of the company s certificate and objection to the seller s certificate to resolve their differences 
if they could not reach agreement within that period  the stock purchase agreement requires that their disagreements shall be submitted to an independent accountant for resolution 
the parties have not been able to agree on either the amount of the purchase price adjustment or the methodology to calculate the adjustment  and entech refused to refer the matter to the independent accountant 
consequently  on november   westmoreland initiated an action in the supreme court of new york seeking specific performance of the purchase price adjustment methodology in the stock purchase agreement 
the supreme court of new york agreed with westmoreland and ordered entech and montana power to comply with the purchase price adjustment methodology in the stock purchase agreement

page impact of acquisitions the acquisitions completed in the second quarter of have significantly affected the company s financial and operating results for the year ended december  the operations of wml  since the effective date of the acquisitions  have contributed the following year ended december  in thousands coal revenues  operating income  a cash provided by operating activities  a increased selling and administrative costs  a does not include  in management fees paid by wml to wcc 
these results may not necessarily be indicative of the results to be realized in future periods 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the acquisitions also affected the company s balance sheet at acquisition by adding  of acquisition debt   of revolving debt for working capital and  of assumed debt adding property  plant and equipment of  adding accrued reclamation costs of  partially offset by currently invested cash collateral of  providing the basis for recognizing a deferred tax asset of  the above amounts are included in the consolidated financial statements 
also included as of december  is  of cash and  of restricted cash held by wml  which along with its cash from continuing operations  is dedicated to debt service and funding of the debt service reserve required by the term loan and revolving credit agreements 
until the debt service reserve account is fully funded  wml may not distribute any earnings to the company  however  for quarters ended on or before december   wml was permitted to distribute up to  per quarter to the company 
this  distribution was in addition to the  management fee that wml may pay the company each quarter 
the company expects that the debt service reserve account will be fully funded in march while the acquisitions are generating significant positive operating cash flows  the term notes and revolving credit facility agreements include certain conditions with respect to the use of such cash flows which will affect the amount of cash flows available for general use by the company  particularly in the first year following the acquisitions as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
page the final purchase price for the acquisition of montana power s coal business is subject to adjustment 
as discussed in item legal proceedings  the company and montana power have not been able to agree on either the amount of the purchase price adjustment or the methodology to calculate the adjustment 
the company initiated action in the supreme court of new york  seeking specific performance of the purchase price methodology 
any change in the purchase price will result in a change to the preliminary purchase price allocation 
if the purchase price is reduced  amounts received are required to repay the acquisition debt 
in the unlikely event an additional purchase price payment is required to be made by the company  it would likely be funded by the use of wml s revolving credit facility 
although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome  the company believes its claims are meritorious and intends to pursue its rights vigorously 
the future income expected to be generated by the acquisitions will allow the company to use at least a portion of its tax net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result and as required by generally accepted accounting principles  the company recognized a  deferred tax asset on the acquisition date 
as taxable income is generated in future periods and the net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  the tax asset will be reduced and a non cash deferred income tax expense will be recognized and no regular federal income taxes will be paid 
under purchase accounting for the acquisitions  recognition of the deferred tax asset reduced the company s basis in the property  plant and equipment acquired  thus reducing future depreciation and depletion expense 
this accounting treatment has no effect on cash flows  which will reflect the full benefit to the company of using its tax loss carryforwards 
the company describes in this filing many important issues affecting it 
in order to facilitate understanding of the company s operations  results and future performance certain critical accounting policies and contractual obligations and commitments are presented in the following two sections 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in the consolidated financial statements 
it is increasingly important to understand that the application of generally accepted accounting principles involve certain assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
thus  the application of these principles can result in varying results from company to company 
the most significant principles that impact the company and its subsidiaries relate to post retirement benefits and pension obligations  reclamation costs and reserve estimates  consolidation policy  depletion of mineral rights and development costs included in property  plant and equipment and deferred income taxes 
the following discussion highlights those impacts 
the most significant long term obligations of the company are post retirement medical and life insurance benefits and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
the majority of these benefits are provided through self funded programs 
the company describes these obligations as heritage health benefit costs and the estimated amount of future payments for such obligations are determined actuarially 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these future benefits was reduced from in to in and will be adjusted annually based upon interest rate fluctuations 
the discount rate used can vary from company to company 
in addition  the estimated amount of future claims is affected by the assumed health care cost trend rate 
during  the company increased the initial cost trend rate assumption to from 
these factors  among others  greatly affected the annual expense which totaled million in compared to million in and the recorded liability of million at december  for post retirement medical and life insurance costs 
the pneumoconiosis obligation has an excess of funds held in trust over the obligation of million 
page the company s share of reclamation costs  along with other costs related to mine closure  are accrued and charged against income on a units of production basis over the life of the mine  except at wri where only monitoring costs are fixed and are being expensed over a year period 
future costs of reclamation are estimated based upon the standards for mine reclamation that have been established by various regulatory agencies that regulate the company s mining operations 
estimated costs can change and the liability included in the financial statements of million as of december  must be viewed as an estimate which is subject to revision 
the remaining coal reserves used to calculate annual reclamation expense are also engineering estimates and are subject to change 
the company s consolidation policy is described in the consolidated financial statements 
in particular  the general and limited interests in partnerships owned by wei related to independent power projects are accounted for under the equity method  as disclosed in note wei performs project development and venture and asset management services for the partnerships but does not control them 
the rova projects had approximately million in long term debt as of december   all of which was non recourse to wei and westmoreland and is not included in the consolidated financial statements of the company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company depletes its mineral acquisition  development costs and some plant and equipment using the units of production method based upon estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves 
these estimates are reviewed on a regular basis and are adjusted to reflect current mining plans 
as a result  changes in estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves could change amounts recorded in the future for amortization of development costs 
the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method 
one of the largest potential assets of the company is the federal net operating loss carryforwards which were approximately million as of december  utilization of these losses to reduce future income taxes until they all expire in the year is dependent upon many factors which determine taxable income 
these factors include the timing of tax deductions for certain obligations  such as postretirement medical benefits and reclamation  percentage depletion of coal production  and any potential limitation on using losses due to a change of ownership in the company 
each period  the company assesses and estimates future utilization of the tax losses and its impact on the recognition of deferred tax assets 
as a result of the recent acquisitions  the company recognized a million deferred income tax asset on the acquisition date which assumed that a portion of the previously unrecognized net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized through the generation of future taxable income 
any increases or decreases to this asset affect deferred income tax expense and can materially affect net earnings resulting in an effective book income tax rate different than the federal statutory rate 
page contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents contractual obligations or estimates and commitments of the company as of december   which are discussed elsewhere in this filing

significant coal contract issues westmoreland acquired several existing coal supply agreements when it purchased the coal businesses of montana power 
weco supplies coal to the four colstrip units under two distinct contracts 
the contract for units and calls for the price to be reopened on the contract s thirtieth anniversary  which was july  and gives the parties six months to negotiate a new delivered price for coal 
if the parties are unable to agree on a new price  the issue is submitted to binding arbitration 
weco and the owners of units and have been negotiating since july in an attempt to reach an agreement for the price of coal through the deadline provided in the contract for arbitration has been extended  however  it is possible that the parties will not agree on the price of delivered coal and the issue will be arbitrated 
while weco believes it is due a price increase  as with any arbitration  the outcome is uncertain 
weco also supplies coal pursuant to a long term coal supply agreement csa to owners of the colstrip and electric generating units 
the csa allows for the full recovery of weco s costs  plus a return on investment and profit 
pursuant to the provisions of the csa  an annual operating plan aop must be approved by the units and owners 
if the parties are in disagreement over any component of the aop  the csa provides avenues for dispute resolution over the components in dispute prior to arbitration 
page nwr  as part of a settlement of pending litigation entered into the lsa in with reliant 
the lsa preserved the existing cost plus contract structure through june   when the price shifts to a market based price derived by comparison to the value of powder river basin prb spot coal delivered to legs 
the price must be between a minimum and a maximum as determined in the lsa 
the contract provides for nwr to make its annual tonnage commitments one year in advance and six months before the price is determined 
legs is obligated to take nwr s committed tonnage 
nwr has nominated tonnages it will deliver to legs through december   however  the price for the nominated tonnage will not be set until july  nwr always has the right to supply nominated volumes as well as any additional fuel required by legs as long as it meets the price equivalent to the value of prb coal at legs 
in the event that nwr elects not to match the equivalent prb value on all or any portion of the legs fuel requirement  reliant may purchase prb coal 
nwr has begun discussions with reliant to resolve pricing for the eighteen month supply of lignite it has nominated through december  it is expected that nwr will make similar tonnage nominations until the contract expires in in addition  nwr and reliant are discussing impacts of changes to legs and construction of a rail unloader 
to protect its contract rights and  if necessary  obtain guidance on interpreting the lsa in the changed circumstances  nwr has filed a declaratory judgment action in freestone county  texas 
the litigation has only recently been filed and it is too early to predict any likelihood of success 
if the cost of delivering prb coal became such that nwr determined that producing lignite was uneconomic  reliant would be obligated to begin performance of final reclamation activities 
refer to item legal proceedings for further information 
in addition to the contract issues discussed above  the company is involved with various other legal proceedings  described in item legal proceedings  which may affect the company s liquidity 
other risks westmoreland s businesses use large equipment  including mining and power generation equipment and conveyor systems used for the transportation of coal 
while every effort is made to maintain this equipment  there is always a risk that unexpected equipment breakdowns can interrupt either the production of coal or generation of electricity 
unexpected equipment failure at electric generating units  called forced outages  if significant  may adversely impact westmoreland 
these forced outages could cause fluctuations in delivery of coal or distributions from westmoreland s independent power plants 
for example  the colstrip unit was shut down in january and february for unexpected repairs which will reduce coal sales from the rosebud mine during the first quarter 
westmoreland s business is subject to some seasonality 
weather has the potential to impact westmoreland s business 
coal is supplied to electric generation units and if winter is unseasonably warm or summer is unseasonably cool  the customer s need for coal may be less than expected 
the mild winter of has decreased the demand for electrical generation and is lowering the company s coal sales

preferred stock dividends at a rate of per annum were paid quarterly from the third quarter of through the first quarter of the declaration and payment of preferred stock dividends was suspended in the second quarter of in connection with extension agreements with the company s principal lenders 
upon the expiration of these extension agreements  the company paid a quarterly dividend on april  and july  pursuant to the requirements of delaware law  described below  the preferred stock dividend was suspended in the third quarter of as a result of recognition of losses and the subsequent shareholders deficit 
the company conducted two tender offers for its preferred stock in  the company s purchases of preferred stock from preferred stockholders in pursuant to these two offers reduced shareholders equity by  the quarterly dividends which are accumulated but unpaid through and including january  amount to  in the aggregate per preferred share or per depositary share

the company had shareholders equity at december  of  and the par value of all outstanding shares of preferred stock and shares of common stock aggregated  at december  the board of directors continues to review the subject of reinstating the preferred stock dividend and satisfying the accumulated unpaid dividends on the preferred stock 
based upon the acquisitions consummated by the company during the second quarter and the anticipation of positive earnings  the company s board expects to review again  in the next six months  the possibility of reinstating the preferred stock dividend and the issue of the accumulated unpaid dividends 
the company continues to be committed to meeting its obligations to the preferred shareholders in a manner consistent with the best interests of all shareholders 
liquidity outlook the major factors impacting the company s liquidity outlook are its significant heritage health benefit costs  its debt repayment requirements  and its ongoing and future business needs 
the company s principal sources of cash flow are dividends from wri  distributions from independent power projects and distributions from wml which are limited by its debt agreement provisions 
while the company was able to meet its retiree health benefit and other obligations with operating cash flows and proceeds from the sales of non strategic assets during the course of its restructuring  it sought a long term solution to improve its financial position 
following the dismissal of its bankruptcy case in december  the company undertook an extensive review and analysis of its strategic plan for growth 
the result was a development plan focused on expanding the company s existing core operations and acquiring profitable businesses in the energy sector where america s dual goals of low cost power and a clean environment could be effectively addressed 
the company has sought to do this in niche markets that will minimize exposure to competition  maximize stability of long term cash flows and provide opportunities for synergistic operation of existing assets and new opportunities in the energy sector 
a key to the company s strategy of acquiring profitable businesses is the availability of approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards nol s at the beginning of the availability of these nol s can shield the company s future taxable income from payment of regular federal income tax and thereby increase the return the company receives from profitable investments as compared to the return a tax paying entity would receive that cannot shield its income from federal income taxation 
page as discussed below  substantial steps towards implementation of the company s strategic plan for growth have now been completed the company completed its acquisition of montana power s coal business on april  these operations produced approximately million tons of coal during the full year ended december  over of current production is sold under long term contracts to the owners of mine mouth power plants located adjacent to the rosebud mine in colstrip  montana and the jewett mine in jewett  texas 
the company completed its acquisition of knife river corporation s coal operations on may   effective april  these operations produce over three million tons of coal annually  again primarily for mine mouth or nearby power plants 
on july   the company signed a definitive agreement for joint development with mdu resources group  inc to develop  own and operate a new state of the art mw lignite fired power plant near gascoyne  north dakota in connection with lignite vision lv 
each party has an undivided fifty percent interest in the project 
lv is a partnership between the state of north dakota and the lignite energy council designed to encourage construction of a new baseload power plant in north dakota and includes up to million in matching funds for development 
each of these opportunities is aimed at enabling the company to expand its operations in order to meet its significant heritage health benefit costs and other ongoing business needs and objectives  resume and sustain dividend payments  pay accumulated unpaid dividends on the preferred stock  and increase shareholder value 
given the demand for new power generating capacity  stronger energy pricing  the need for stabilizing fuel and electricity costs  and pressure to reduce harmful emissions into the environment  the company believes that its strategic plan positions it well for potential further growth  profitability  and improved liquidity 
the company s acquisitions described above greatly increase revenues and operating cash flow  and return the company to profitability  but the cash used and financing arranged to make those acquisitions could create short term liquidity issues which must be managed 
the company used million of available cash in the second quarter of to complete the acquisitions  knowing that short term liquidity would be temporarily reduced due to the requirements of the acquisition financing 
the terms of the acquisition financing facility described in note to the consolidated financial statements restrict distributions to the company from wml  particularly in the first twelve months after closing while the required debt service reserve account is being fully funded 
as a result  the limited distributions available from wml during that period along with remaining cash reserves and the distributions from the company s other principal sources of operating cash flow  which include distributions from independent power projects  dividends from wri  and interest on cash reserves  might not be adequate to cover all of the company s heritage health benefit costs and operating expenses during that period due to the timing of distributions or worse than expected performance 
therefore  the company has continued to take steps to conserve its cash 
the company has also investigated the possible sale of non strategic assets where favorable values could be achieved 
finally  the company has sought other sources of interim financing and working capital 
during the fourth quarter  the company obtained additional financing under a million two year revolving line of credit for general corporate purposes 
management believes that cash flows from operations  along with available borrowings  should be sufficient to pay the company s heritage health benefit costs  meet repayment requirements of the debt facilities  and fund ongoing business activities as long as currently anticipated surplus cash distributions from wml are received 
page a significant source of liquidity  which the company expects to receive in the second quarter of  is the release of the million in cash currently collateralizing its obligations to the umwa funds 
the company agreed to secure its obligations to the umwa funds under the master agreement for a period of six years by providing a contingent promissory note note 
the original principal amount of the note is million with a reduction to million in the note terminates in the note is payable only in the event the company does not meet its coal act obligations  fails to meet certain ongoing financial tests specified in the note  or fails to maintain the required balance of million in an escrow account established through in connection with the note 
the financial tests were met through and cash flows from the rova project exceeded million in  which allows the entire million held in escrow to be returned to the company 
other sources of potential additional future liquidity include reimbursement of amounts paid to the umwa pension plan  wri s recovery from washington group for dragline repairs and on other claims  and the effect of any future legislation that causes medicare to cover all or a portion of the cost of prescription drug benefits for the company s retirees 
the company expects that there will be continued upward pressure on corporate insurance and surety bonding rates as a result of insurers world wide loss experiences over the past several years  the terrorist attacks in september and ongoing threats around the world 
absent legislative relief  medical and health care costs may also continue to increase 
the company does not anticipate that its coal and power production will diminish materially as a result of the current economic downturn because the independent power projects in which the company owns interests and the power plants that purchase coal mined by the company produce relatively low cost  baseload power 
in addition  the company is party to long term contracts  which help insulate the company from downward price reductions 
the following paragraphs specifically describe the health benefit and retirement obligations of the company 
the company s heritage health benefit costs consist primarily of payments for post retirement medical and workers compensation benefits 
the company also is obligated for employee pension and pneumoconiosis benefits  however  these obligations have a funding surplus at present 
the company currently expects to incur cash costs in excess of  for post retirement medical benefits in  which costs are expected to continue to increase in the near term and then decline to zero over the next approximately thirty five years 
as a result of the acquisitions completed in  the company assumed additional obligations  as of april   for post retirement medical and life insurance benefits of approximately  which will negatively impact the estimated annual expenditures for benefits 
due to the impact of increasing healthcare cost trends on the actuarial valuations of future obligations the company s total estimated liability has increased and the heritage health benefit expense for may increase approximately 
the company expects to incur cash costs of less than  for workers compensation benefits in  and expects that amount to steadily decline to zero over the next approximately nineteen years 
there were no workers compensation obligations assumed in conjunction with the acquisitions as all operations are fully insured 
page one element of heritage health benefit costs is umwa pensions under the retirement plan 
since this plan is a multiemployer plan under erisa  a contributing company is liable for its share of unfunded vested liabilities upon termination or withdrawal from the plan 
the company believes the plan was fully funded in when the company terminated its last umwa employees who were participants in the retirement plan and withdrew from the plan 
however  the plan claims that the company withdrew on a date earlier than the date on which the company terminated its last umwa employee and that when the company withdrew the plan was not fully funded 
the plan has asserted a claim of  which the company is vigorously contesting through arbitration as provided under erisa 
the company recognized the  asserted liability in the arbitration proceeding began june  and evidence regarding determination of the appropriate withdrawal date has been submitted 
the company is awaiting the arbitrator s decision on the withdrawal date issue 
determination of the amount of withdrawal liability  if any  was deferred until the withdrawal date was determined 
if necessary  a second arbitration proceeding to determine the amount of withdrawal liability will be held 
in accordance with the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of  the company has made monthly principal and interest payments to the plan while it pursues its rights and will continue to make such monthly payments until arbitration is completed 
included in the payments made in is interest of approximately  and principal of  at the conclusion of arbitration the company may be entitled to a refund or it could be required to pay any remaining obligation in installments through under the coal industry retiree health benefit act of coal act  the company is required to provide postretirement medical benefits for umwa miners by making premium payments into three benefit plans i the umwa combined benefit fund the combined fund  a multiemployer plan which benefits miners who retired before january  or who retired thereafter but whose last employer did not provide benefits pursuant to an operator specific individual employer plan iep  ii an iep for miners who retired after january   and iii the umwa benefit plan  a multiemployer plan which benefits a miners who were eligible to retire on february   who did retire on or before september  and whose former employers are no longer in business  b miners receiving benefits under an iep whose former employer goes out of business and ceases to maintain the iep  and c new spouses or new dependents of retirees in the combined fund who would be eligible for coverage thereunder but for the fact that the combined fund was closed to new beneficiaries as of july  the premiums paid by the company cover its own retirees and its allocated portion of the pool of retired miners whose previous employers have gone out of business 
the coal act also authorized the trustees of the umwa benefit plan to implement security provisions for the future payment of benefits pursuant to the coal act 
the trustees set the level of security for each company at an amount equal to three years benefits 
the company secured its obligation to provide retiree health benefits under the plan by posting a bond in the amount of million in which was increased to million in and decreased to million in the bond amount and the amount to be secured are to be reviewed and adjusted on an annual basis 
the bond was collateralized by us government backed securities in the amount of  at march  which amount the company withdrew during second quarter in connection with a change of bonding agents 
the company s previous bonding agent required collateral equal to of the bonded amount 
the company s bond amount is increasing by approximately  in and the bonding agent has requested cash collateral be deposited 
the company is currently negotiating financing arrangements for the  increase 
page the combined fund faces an ongoing solvency crisis because benefit expenses continue to exceed premiums from contributing companies 
the combined fund sought additional funding relief from congress in under the sponsorship of senators byrd and rockefeller of west virginia  the house and senate approved  as a part of the interior and related agencies appropriations bill  a transfer of accumulated interest in the abandoned mine land reclamation fund aml to the combined fund 
in its report  the conference committee noted that this was a short term solution and urged that the congressional committees with jurisdiction over the matter work with the concerned parties to insure the long term solvency of the combined fund 
the conference committee went on to admonish the parties not to ask for additional funding from aml in the future 
this funding was in addition to the annual transfer from the aml funds and does not prevent the combined fund from continuing to operate at a deficit 
prior to leaving office  president clinton signed a grant authorizing the grant of million to the umwa benefit funds by the department of health and human services hhs to create and implement a prescription drug pilot program  which was premised on managing drug therapy and delivery of health care services to reduce hospitalizations for the elderly 
the theory supporting the grant was that the elderly either forget to take prescription medications or because the cost of prescription medications is prohibitive intentionally hoard or ration their medications 
the program intended to create a network or quasi buddy system where regular contacts and calls would be made to ask if medication had been taken or meals eaten 
in addition to establishing the networking or monitoring system  the grant funds were to also help underwrite the costs of prescription medicines 
by alleviating some of the cost concerns  the reminders provided by the network system improve the regularity that prescription medications are taken and improve overall health  thereby reducing hospitalizations 
as structured  the hhs grant provides an additional million per year for the combined fund s use specifically directed at affecting prescription drug costs 
the pilot program was established in only a few states 
westmoreland is monitoring the program 
the debate over prescription drug costs for the elderly continues to generate a great deal of interest from both political parties  their leaders and in the press around the country 
while health care generally remains one of the most discussed matters of public policy  politicians have begun to focus increasingly on the specific concern of meeting the pharmaceutical needs of the medicare eligible population 
congress included billion over five years in its fy budget to fund some form of prescription drug benefit 
several bills were introduced in both the house and senate during the th congress 
however  no prescription drug legislation passed both houses 
with mid term elections this fall  both parties promise some form of prescription drug legislation 
on january   president bush announced his intent to spend billion over the next decade to overhaul medicare and provide prescription drug benefits for low income seniors 
of the billion that president bush wants to spend on medicare reform  billion is earmarked for prescription drug benefits 
lawmakers from both parties immediately said that the billion was insufficient 
it is expected that other versions of a prescription drug benefit will be introduced in this session of congress and both the amount of spending and population that will benefit will be vigorously debated 
page a medicare prescription drug benefit that covers medicare eligible beneficiaries covered by the coal act could address one of the company s largest costs 
westmoreland currently pays over million per year on retirees health care costs and over of that is for prescription drugs 
there is no assurance at this time what  if any  proposal will be enacted into law or what effect that it may have on the company s obligation 
the company is monitoring energy deregulation and other industry trends 
at both the national and state level  there is an ongoing debate about removing regulatory constraints and allowing competition and market forces to determine the price of electricity 
several states have already passed legislation either permitting immediate wholesale and or retail competition or providing a mechanism for transitioning to a competitive marketplace 
at this time  the promulgation of state legislation is not expected to have any immediate impact on existing long term power purchase agreements 
several proposed bills  calling for deregulation of the traditional utility monopolies  are pending in the us congress 
when  or if  some form of national deregulation legislation will be enacted cannot be predicted 
impacts of enron s collapse and the california energy crisis on the deregulation debate are also uncertain 
however  it is likely that deregulation issues will be more critically analyzed and the process is likely to slow down 
in addition to deregulation  current industry trends include increased demand for new generating capacity and addressing problems with existing transmission capacity  the need for stabilizing fuel and electricity costs  and pressure to reduce harmful emissions into the environment 
the company s experience in developing new generating capacity and its current coal production capability may enable the company to take advantage of these trends 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to successfully capitalize on  or that any profitable opportunities will arise  as a result of these trends 
in previous years  wri expended approximately  to repair the dragline at wri 
all of these expenditures substantially increased the productive life of the dragline and therefore  were capitalized 
the company believes that  under the terms of wri s agreements with washington group  washington group is responsible for all dragline repairs 
wri expended these amounts to assure continued  uninterrupted production at wri  and has demanded reimbursement from washington group for the full cost of the repair 
washington group has reimbursed wri for approximately  of these costs 
on march   wri commenced litigation against washington group in the united states district court for the district of montana seeking  among other things  payment by washington group of approximately million of dragline repair costs paid or expected to be paid by wri  plus accrued interest 
the company has not recorded any amounts that may be recoverable from washington group in its consolidated financial statements 
on march   washington group announced that it was facing a severe near term liquidity problem due to a delay in resolving purchase price adjustments in connection with an acquisition and in may  washington group sought protection in the bankruptcy court in reno  nevada 
wri filed claims against washington group to recover the cost of repairing the dragline tub  for overcharges on mining costs  potential royalty underpayment as alleged by the minerals management service in a recent demand letter and seeking adequate assurances that washington group will perform its contractual obligations regarding reclamation 
in addition  wri objected to the assumption of existing contract mining agreements between wri and washington group 
while washington group s plan of reorganization has been approved  wri s issues remain unresolved and pending in the bankruptcy court  except for the tub litigation discussed in item legal proceedings 
it is expected that these issues will be resolved this year  however  the company cannot currently determine what impact  if any  the reorganization may have on its operations or this litigation 
page as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has certain contract contingencies  which may impact future sales  prices received and cost of operations 
these include wri s dispute with wgi regarding both past and current pricing for contract mining services 
replacement or extension of the current coal supply agreement with wri s largest customer which expires at the end of and another customer s request to explore acceleration of a contract reopener provision from into determination of supply and pricing at legs  which uses lignite from the jewett mine

the availability of the company s net operating loss carryforwards  nols  which the company hopes to fully utilize through its growth strategy  is governed by section of the internal revenue code of code 
the code limits the utilization of a corporation s nols if an ownership change within the meaning of the code an ownership change occurs with respect to that corporation 
in general  an ownership change occurs if  among other things  percent shareholders within the meaning of the code percent shareholders increase their percentage ownership of the corporation s stock by more than percentage points over any three year period 
a percent shareholder is any person who owns percent or more of the value of the corporation s stock  and the value of the corporation s stock is the sum of the market values of all of the corporation s outstanding shares 
the company continues to monitor the ongoing status of ownership changes by percent shareholders and cautions its current shareholders and potential investors that the creation of new percent shareholders or trading by existing percent shareholders could negatively impact the calculation of the ownership change 
the company believes that  based on public information currently on file  there has not been an ownership change  but that the percentage of change is approximately as of december  if the percentage of change begins to approach the limitation  then the company may ask existing and potential shareholders for their assistance in minimizing the change 
if the change exceeds the limitation  the company may be unable to use a portion of its nols 
page future growth in light of the impact on the company of post retirement health benefit costs under the coal act  constraints upon the payment of dividends imposed by delaware law and the restrictive covenants of the master agreement  management concluded that the execution of a growth strategy was vital to the company s continued ability to operate  pay accumulated dividends on the preferred stock  resume and sustain dividend payments in the future  and create value for shareholders 
following the dismissal of its bankruptcy case  the company undertook an extensive review  analysis and development of its strategic plan for growth as discussed above 
among the issues the company considered in the course of its strategic planning were the market for energy in the united states  including forecasts under various economic assumptions about levels of demand for different sources of power  forecasts about levels of supply for different sources of power  and forecasts as to cost and price data 
the continuing impact of de regulation on the energy market 
the continuing impact of laws and regulations designed to protect the environment on the supply of and demand for power produced from different sources  and the opportunities that presently exist and that may arise to balance the country s desire for affordable energy and a clean environment 
the business opportunities that existed and that the company believed would arise in the energy sector 
the availability of approximately million at the beginning of of net operating loss carryforwards nols  to shield the company s future profits from federal income taxation and thereby increase the return the company receives from profitable investments as compared with the return a tax paying entity that cannot shield its income from federal income tax would receive 
alternatives to optimize the value of the company s existing assets  including sales of assets  if the price is favorable to the company  recognizing that the company s asset base delivers tax shielded cash flow to the company and are burdened by the coal act  both of which tend to make such assets more valuable to the company than to potential tax paying buyers 
potential sources of additional cash that might become available to the company  including the possible reimbursement of the company s expenditures to repair the dragline at wri and the other potential sources described in the liquidity outlook section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the financial effect of possible legislative developments  such as a prescription drug program  that could substantially reduce the company s obligations under the coal act since over of the company s post retirement medical costs are for retiree prescription drug benefits 
the importance of properly prioritizing and sequencing the company s efforts  and maximizing use of available cash to meet all strategic business objectives  including the tax advantaged expansion of the company through acquisitions  and the ability to pay accumulated and future stock dividends 
page the company s strategic plan adopted focuses on expanding the company s existing core operations and acquiring profitable businesses in the energy sector where america s dual goals of low cost power and a clean environment can be effectively addressed 
the company seeks to do this in niche markets that will minimize exposure to competition  maximize stability of long term cash flows and provide opportunities for synergistic operation of existing assets and new opportunities in the energy sector

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of changes in commodity prices as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company  through its subsidiaries wri and wml  produces and sells coal to third parties from coal mining operations in montana  texas and north dakota and through its subsidiary  wei  produces and sells electricity and steam to third parties from its independent power projects located in north carolina and colorado 
nearly all of the company s coal production and all of its electricity and steam production is sold through long term contracts with customers 
these long term contracts serve to minimize the company s exposure to changes in commodity prices 
the company has not entered into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to changes in commodity prices  and was not a party to any such contracts at december  page interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries are subject to interest rate risk on its debt obligations 
long term debt obligations have both fixed and variable interest rates  and the company s revolving line of credit has a variable rate of interest indexed to either the prime rate or libor 
interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  based on the balances outstanding as of december   a one percent change in the prime interest rate or libor would increase interest expense by  on an annual basis 
the company s heritage health benefit costs are also impacted by interest rate changes because its pension  pneumoconiosis and post retirement medical benefit obligations are recorded on a discounted basis
