item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we operate primarily through two business segments the companion animal group cag and the food and environmental division fed 
cag comprises our veterinary diagnostic products and services  veterinary pharmaceuticals business  and veterinary information products and services 
fed comprises our services and products for food and water testing 
through a series of transactions completed in late and the first quarter of  we sold substantially all of our businesses related to food microbiology testing 
fed now comprises our water and dairy testing business and our production animal services business 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  which may negatively affect our ability to dispose of inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
our inventories as of december  included million of raw materials associated with our nitazoxanide product in registration with the fda  of which million will expire and become unusable in and the remainder has no expiration date 
we have completed manufacturing and efficacy components of our submission to the fda 
we have completed additional safety studies requested by the fda with respect to this product and are preparing a submission reporting the results of these studies 
we believe that the product is approvable by the fda and that this inventory will be saleable upon such approval 
if this product is not approved by the fda  we believe we have the ability to recoup a substantial portion of our costs through alternative future uses of the material or other means 
we have provided reserves to cover estimated potential losses in this scenario 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the fda will approve this product or  if approval is not obtained  that our current estimates of recovery of our investment in this inventory will not change 
our inventories include million of slides used in our chemistry instruments  which represents approximately turns based on recent historical usage 
these slides have a shelf life of months at the date of manufacture 
the average remaining shelf life at december  was months 
in addition  we are required to purchase million of slides over the remaining nine years of our contract with ortho 
we believe the demand for these slides is at a level sufficient to ensure that we will not incur a loss on the inventory or the contract 
however  a reduction in the demand for slides could cause us to incur a loss related to our slide inventory or purchase commitments at a future date 
our inventories include million of component parts associated with our lasercyte hematology instrument  which is in the final stages of development 
in addition  we have placed million in deposits with vendors to secure additional critical components and we have firm purchase commitments of an additional million 
we expect to launch this product in the second half of and to fully realize our investment and purchase commitments 
however  if we are unable to introduce this product  or if we alter the final design  we may be required to write off a certain amount of the associated inventory 
the slides  nitazoxanide and lasercyte products are included in our cag segment 
page valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above  we measure any impairment based on the projected undiscounted cash flow method 
net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to million as of december   consisting of million related to veterinary laboratories  million related to water test products  million related to veterinary pharmaceutical products and million of other 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during if the existing standards had been continued 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first half of we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment including to distributors for substantially all products except software licenses and hardware systems 
we recognize revenue from non cancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation and customer acceptance of the software because at this time collection is probable and we have no significant further obligations after installation 
our distributors do not have the right to return products 
service revenue is recognized at the time the service is performed 
maintenance revenue is billed in advance and recognized over the life of the contracts  usually one year or less 
certain instrument systems are sold to a third party finance company that leases these systems to its customers with a right of return privilege 
we allow the third party finance company to return these instruments to us for a partial refund based on the time from product return to end of lease term 
therefore we recognize revenue under these contracts over the term of the underlying customer lease contract 
we lease certain instruments directly to customers and recognize revenues from those leases over the terms of those leases 
we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings  which may give customers future rights such as free or discounted goods or services or trade in rights 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able t o realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
page we do not provide for us income taxes on earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when tax effective to do so 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings  however  we believe that us foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any us taxes or offset any foreign withholding taxes 
warranty reserves we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  which are based on historical data and engineering estimates  where applicable  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
in the second half of  we expect to introduce the lasercyte system 
we expect that sales of this system will cause warranty expense to increase significantly in we will charge warranty expense to the cost of lasercyte sales based upon our experience with instrument sales and engineering information about the system 
should actual warranty expense exceed our estimates  our cost of sales of lasercyte systems would increase 
results of operations compared to companion animal group revenue for cag increased million  or to million from million in the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in sales of veterinary reference laboratory services  canine test kits and acarexx  a treatment for ear mites in cats  partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates and a decrease in sales of slides 
increased sales of veterinary reference laboratory services were attributable primarily to incremental sales resulting from our acquisition of veterinary pathology services pty 
ltd 
vps in july and from increased sales from laboratories in existence during both reporting periods 
decreased sales of slides resulted primarily from a reduction in distributor inventory levels for this product 
increased sales of canine test kits were attributable primarily to increased sales of our canine snap dx combination test  which we introduced in march sal es of acarexx in were largely incremental to because we launched this product in december as of december  our us veterinary diagnostic product distributors were holding million of inventory  or approximately eight weeks based on projected future sales 
these distributors were carrying million  or approximately nine weeks  of inventory as of december  gross profit as a percent of cag s revenue decreased to from in improved margins on veterinary reference laboratory services and the veterinary practice information management software product line were offset by our inability to absorb fixed costs as a result of delays in the launch of our nitazoxanide new animal drug and our lasercyte hematology instrument and by unfavorable exchange rates 
the increased margins from veterinary reference laboratory services were attributable primarily to cost savings from process automation and reduced courier costs 
the increase in margin from the veterinary practice information management software product line was attributable primarily to infrastructure reductions in our veterinary internet portal and customer service operations 
operating expenses relating to cag increased million  or to million from million in the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in veterinary diagnostic sales personnel and related overhead  offset by a decrease in expenses relating to our veterinary practice information management software product line 
food and environmental division revenue for fed increased million  or to million from million in the increase was attributable primarily to increased sales of water testing products  including incremental revenue from the acquisition of genera technologies limited genera  partially offset by decreased sales of dairy testing products  the impact of unfavorable exchange rates and decreased sales of food testing products 
sales of dairy testing products declined due to the elimination of our lactek product in the second quarter of  increased competition and product unavailability due to manufacturing issues 
sales of food testing products declined due to the divestiture of the food microbiology testing business in the first quarter of page gross profit as a percent of fed s revenue increased to from in the increase in gross margin percentage was attributable primarily to increased sales of higher margin water testing products  including those products from genera  partially offset by decreased margins on dairy testing products due to our inability to absorb fixed costs as a result of lower manufacturing volumes 
operating expenses relating to fed increased million  or to million from million in the increase was attributable primarily to incremental operating expenses and amortization associated with the acquisition of genera and a million one time gain on the sale of the food product lines that was recorded as a reduction of operating expenses in  partially offset by the elimination of operating expenses associated with the food product lines 
compared to companion animal group revenue for cag increased million  or to million from million in the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in sales of veterinary reference laboratory services  vettest slides and feline and canine test kits 
the increase in veterinary reference laboratory services was attributable primarily to incremental revenues from laboratories acquired in and  including the laboratory businesses of tufts university school of veterinary medicine acquired in december and vps acquired in july the increase in vettest slides was attributable to an increase in instrument placements  including those through our rental program  and increased customer utilization per instrument 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of veterinary practice information management software systems  which were unusually high in as a result of customer upgrades made in anticipation of the year gross profit as a percent of cag s revenue decreased to from in the reduction in gross margin percentage was attributable primarily to increased sales of lower gross margin veterinary reference laboratory services  higher cost of veterinary instrument service and unabsorbed fixed costs associated with decreased sales of veterinary practice information management software systems  partially offset by increased sales of higher margin instrument consumables 
operating expenses relating to cag increased million to million from million in the increase was attributable primarily to enhancement of existing diagnostic platforms  an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with the pharmaceutical product line and research and development expenses related to vetconnect 
com  our internet site for animal health professionals 
additionally  we incurred non recurring severance and facilities expenses of million associated with consolidation of the internet business and the veterinary practice information management software systems business 
food and environmental division revenue for fed decreased million  or to million from million in the decrease was attributable primarily to the divestiture of the food microbiology testing business  and to a lesser extent  decreased sales of dairy testing products 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of water testing products  including incremental sales resulting from the acquisition of genera in august  and increased sales of livestock test kits 
gross profit as a percent of fed s revenue increased to from in the increase was primarily due to the divestiture of the lower gross margin food microbiology testing business and increased sales of higher gross margin water testing products 
page operating expenses relating to fed decreased million to million from million in the decrease was attributable primarily to the elimination of operating expenses associated with the food microbiology testing products business and to a million gain on the sale of such business that was recorded as a decrease of expenses 
interest income  net net interest income was million for compared with million during the decrease in interest income was mainly due to lower invested cash balances  as discussed below  as well as lower effective interest rates 
net interest income was million for compared with million for the prior year 
the decrease in interest income was principally the result of lower invested cash balances due to the use of cash for our share repurchase program and the purchase of vps and genera  partially offset by higher effective interest rates 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was for compared with for and in the reduction in the effective tax rate was the result of continued realization of tax benefits resulting from business operations in jurisdictions with lower effective income tax rates 
subsequent event in january  david e

ayers 
under an october agreement with mr 
shaw  we are required to make certain payments and provide certain benefits to him following a succession to a new chief executive officer 
as a result  we will incur in the first quarter of a pre tax charge of approximately million  million of which is non cash

liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of which million is restricted and working capital of million 
as of december   we had long term investments of million 
in connection with the acquisition of genera in august  we issued million in notes payable to a former shareholder of genera 
million of the notes are due on demand and secured by cash in escrow 
million of the notes are due in annual installments over four years and have been discounted to 
the former shareholder has elected to defer the first million payment that was due in august  and therefore  the deferred payment now bears interest at and is due on demand 
we have entered into a million uncommitted line of credit with a large multi national bank 
under the terms of this agreement the bank retains the right to approve all borrowings and all borrowings are due on demand 
any borrowings under this line will bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
there were no loans outstanding under this agreement at december page we purchased approximately million in fixed assets during the year ended december   principally related to the cag segment 
our total capital budget for is approximately million 
under certain supply agreements with suppliers of veterinary instruments  slides for our vettest instruments and certain raw materials  at december  we had aggregate commitments to purchase approximately million of products in cash provided by operating activities was million during cash of million was used to fund an increase in inventories  attributable principally to the cag segment 
these increases relate primarily to contractually required purchases of vettest slides  inventory associated with the development of our lasercyte hematology instrument  and inventory associated with our nitazoxanide new animal drug in registration with the fda 
during and  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to ten million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
as of december    and  approximately   and  cumulative shares  respectively  had been repurchased under this program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are required to make the following payments in the years below in thousands contractual obligations total after notes payable operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we believe that current cash  short term investments  long term investments  debt facilities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
future operating results the future operating results of idexx involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
idexx s future growth will depend on several factors 
the rate of growth of sales of certain of our products has declined over the past several years 
to increase our growth rate  we will need to successfully implement strategies  including developing  manufacturing and marketing new products with new features and capabilities  including pharmaceutical products and a new hematology system  expanding our market by increasing use of our products by our customers  strengthening our sales and marketing activities in geographies outside of the united states  developing and implementing new technology development and licensing strategies  and identifying and completing acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business areas for us 
however  we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase our growth rate 
the markets in which idexx competes are competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change 
we face intense competition within the markets that we sell our products and services 
we expect that future competition will become even more intense  and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies 
page some of our competitors and potential competitors  including large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater capital  manufacturing  marketing and research and development resources than us 
idexx s products and services are subject to various domestic and foreign government regulations 
in the us  the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda  fda and epa 
compliance with regulations of such government agencies can be cumbersome and expensive 
for example  commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals requires submission of substantial clinical  manufacturing and other data to the fda 
regulatory approval for products submitted to the fda may take several years and following approval  the fda continues to regulate all aspects of the manufacture  labeling  storage  record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
foreign regulatory bodies often establish product standards different from those in the united states  and designing products in compliance with such foreign standards may be difficult or expensive 
delays in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  any necessary regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  any failure to comply with regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products could result in fines and sanctions against us and also could have a negative effect on the sale of our products and services 
idexx s future operating results may be negatively impacted by various factors 
factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products and services  the mix of products and services sold and the mix of domestic versus international revenue could negatively impact our future operating results 
since we sell many of our products through distributors  changes in distributors purchasing patterns could result in lower revenue for us because our revenue for each quarter is usually generated from orders received during that quarter 
our financial performance  therefore  is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable 
our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels 
therefore  a loss in expected revenue could result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income 
idexx s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technologies 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights 
if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights  our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 
we cannot assure that we will obtain issued patents  that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid  or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies 
we also cannot assure that our non disclosure agreements will provide protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
moreover  in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third party patents and we may receive such notices in the future 
patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict 
we cannot assure that we will win a patent litigation case 
if we lose  we may be stopped from selling certain products and or we may be required to pay damages as a result of the lawsuit 
idexx purchases materials for its products from a limited number of sources 
we currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources 
some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary  and therefore may not be available from other sources 
these products include our chemistry and hematology analyzers and related consumables  active ingredients for pharmaceutical products and certain components of our snap devices 
if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future  then we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
page international revenue accounts for a significant portion of idexx s total revenue 
various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales 
possible risks include disruptions in transportation of our products  the differing product and service needs of foreign customers  difficulties in building and managing foreign operations  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  import export duties and quotas  and unexpected regulatory  economic or political changes in foreign markets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk 
we operate subsidiaries in foreign countries and transact business in local currencies 
we attempt to hedge our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions 
corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts and options with a duration of less than months 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accrued liabilities and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   including derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments  a strengthening of the us dollar exchange rates will reduce operating income by approximately million and a weakening of the us dollar exchange rates will increase operating income by approximately million 
the effects of a strengthening of the us dollar exchange rates  if not offset by hedge contracts or related price adjustments  would reduce operating income by approximately million and the effects of a weakening of us dollar exchange rates  if not offset by hedge contracts or related price adjustments  would increase operating income by approximately million
