item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and related financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that markets and sells brand name prescription products 
we focus on the treatment of cardiovascular  obstetrical and gynecological  pediatric and gastroenterological conditions and disorders 
our strategy is to acquire or license pharmaceutical products that other companies do not actively market and that we believe have high sales growth potential  are promotion sensitive and complement our existing products  in addition  we intend to develop new patentable formulations  use new delivery methods and seek regulatory approval for new indications of existing drugs 
we may also acquire businesses with complementary products or development pipelines consistent with our therapeutic focus 
since  we have acquired or licensed products from astrazeneca  aventis  bayer  elan  pfizer  sanofi synthelabo and wyeth 
these acquisitions have included the following sular  a hypertension product acquired in  furadantin  a pediatric urinary tract infection product acquired in  the prenate line of prenatal vitamins acquired in  ponstel  a product for the treatment of pain and painful menstruation acquired in  nitrolingual pumpspray  a product for the treatment of acute angina acquired in  and the robinul line of products  an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of peptic ulcers  acquired in impact of recent acquisitions the following discussion compares our results of operations for the years ended december  and december  as reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
our results of operations for do not include sular and include prenate and furadantin only from august  and december   the respective dates on which we acquired those product lines 
on march   we filed the registration statement to register  shares of common stock 
included in the registration statement is pro forma financial information which contains adjustments to our actual results of operations for to include the actual operating results of such product lines in those portions of during which we did not own such product lines  as well as certain other adjustments attributable to such acquisitions 
as set forth in the following discussion  we believe that our results of operations for and the pro forma financial information is not indicative of our future operating results due to our expectations concerning the following increased revenues as a result of completed and pending acquisitions and our promotional efforts  decreased overall margins as a result of lower margins on sular  increased selling  general and administrative expense related to promotional efforts for our new products  increased depreciation and amortization expense due to completed and pending acquisitions  increased interest expense due to the financing of the sular acquisition with debt and reduced interest income as a result of investing a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in product acquisitions 
pending public offering if completed  estimated net proceeds from the offering described in the registration statement would approximate million based on the sale of  shares of common stock at the public offering price of per share 
in general  we intend to use the proceeds from this offering to repay debt incurred to purchase sular 
further details of the risks involved with this offering  the risks in the event we are unable to complete this offering  the risks that this offering does not generate sufficient proceeds to repay outstanding debt  and the expected use of proceeds can be found in the registration statement 
results of operations years ended december  and december  net revenues increased million  or  over the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the increase in sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased unit sales of our key products tanafed  robinul  nitrolingual pumpspray and ponstel 
according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data  total prescriptions of tanafed  robinul and robinul forte and ponstel increased  and  respectively 
while we do not report independent market data on prescriptions of nitrolingual pumpspray because we believe such data does not capture prescriptions from some of the non retail channels  unit sales of nitrolingual pumpspray also increased substantially 
our operating results for the year ended december  include net sales of prenate advance and prenate gt since august the year ended december  does not include any net sales of furadantin or sular 
prior to our acquisitions of the prenate line  furadantin and sular  the prenate line had us net sales of million for the period of january  through august   furadantin had us net sales of million in calendar year and sular had us net sales of million in calendar year we began to sell nitrolingual pumpspray in february  and ponstel in april  cost of revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  gross margin for the years ended december  and december  was and  respectively 
gross margin for the year ended does not include the impact of furadantin and sular 
gross margins are expected to decrease as sular has previously had a lower gross margin than our other products 
sular had a pro forma gross margin of in selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in  representing our ability to leverage our selling  general and administrative expense over a larger sales base 
selling related expense increased in due to higher commission  royalty and product sampling expense as a result of increased sales and higher advertising  promotion  consulting and market research reporting costs associated with the launch of prenate gt in september selling expense also increased in due to additional commissions under our co promotion agreements with pdi and otsuka for prenate gt and nitrolingual pumpspray  respectively 
selling expense will increase significantly as a result of the acquisitions of sular and  to a lesser extent  furadantin 
we will incur significant training  sampling  advertising and promotion costs during the launch of these products  especially with respect to sular during our second quarter of we also expect to incur increased expense in as a result of our planned expansion of our sales force by up to persons during and our plans to enter into a co promotional arrangement with a third party regarding sular 
general and administrative expense increased for the year ended december  due to additions to our management team and support personnel  and higher insurance costs due to increased insurance coverage 
also included in the expense were one time charges of approximately  for severance to a departing officer as well as approximately  of lease abandonment costs incurred in connection with our move to a new facility 
we recently signed a lease for a  square foot building that we plan to occupy beginning april  which increases the size of our facility by approximately  square feet 
general and administrative expense will increase as a result of the acquisition of sular due to increases in insurance expense and additional personnel we expect to hire during depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher amortization expense related to the acquisition of furadantin on december   the prenate line on august   ponstel on april   cognex on june  and increased depreciation expense for furniture  computer equipment and leasehold improvements at the company s corporate headquarters 
amortization expense for the year ended december  does not include a full year of expense for the prenate line and furadantin 
it also does not include amortization for sular 
amortization expense will increase significantly in and beyond due to the amortization of sular 
during early  depreciation expense will increase due to the accelerated write down of leasehold improvements located in our current facility that we plan to vacate during the second quarter of research and development expense increased  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we continue to incur research and development cost associated with the development of the migraine product and the robinul line extension 
research and development expense for does not include expenses related to the prenate line  furadantin and sular 
we estimate that our research and development expense through will be approximately million due to continued development work on our proposed migraine product and robinul line extension  planned reformulations of prenate gt and other development initiatives 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  at december   we did not have any debt outstanding 
in march as part of the sular acquisition  we incurred million of term debt accruing interest at the eurodollar rate plus and million of revolving debt accruing interest at the eurodollar rate plus 
while these amounts remain outstanding under this credit facility  we expect our monthly expense under this credit facility to be approximately  in addition to such interest expense  we have incurred various fees and may incur additional fees in connection with this credit facility which will be recorded as interest expense during the period in which borrowings under this credit facility are expected to remain outstanding 
these borrowings are expected to be repaid during the second quarter of these fees will range between million and million depending on the timing of the completion of our pending public offering and the retirement of the term loan as more fully described below under liquidity and capital resources 
we expect to use the proceeds from our pending public offering to retire the term loan and reduce the borrowings under the revolver 
if we are unsuccessful in concluding our pending public offering or another equity offering to raise funds sufficient to retire the term loan prior to its maturity date which occurs in september and reduce the borrowings under our revolver to not more than million  we will be required to locate other sources of financing to retire such indebtedness and would expect to incur significant additional fees for such purposes 
interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of interest earned on the proceeds of our follow on offering that we completed in may we expect our interest income for to be lower due to our uses of cash for acquisitions completed during and expected to occur in  and our expected use of most of the proceeds from our pending public offering to retire or reduce the amount of borrowings under our credit facility 
income taxes were provided for at a rate of in compared to in the decrease is primarily due to state income tax structuring initiatives 
years ended december  and december  net revenues increased million or  over the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  sales of continuing products increased million or to million for the year ended december  sales of a discontinued product were  for the year ended december  the increase in sales of continuing products was primarily due to higher unit sales of robinul  robinul forte and tanafed 
sales of nitrolingual pumpspray  ponstel and cognex  were million for the year ended december  we began to sell nitrolingual pumpspray on february  under a license agreement entered into in  ponstel on april  and cognex on june  cost of revenues increased million or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from increased sales of robinul and robinul forte  which have higher margins than our other products  as well as sales of the newly acquired cognex and ponstel products  which also have higher margins 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  selling expense increased due to expansion of our sales force  higher commission expense due to increased sales  increased marketing and promotional expense due to promotional campaigns for new products  increased sampling of our products  increased training expense for new and existing sales representatives and other market research activities 
royalty expense increased due to increased sales of robinul  robinul forte and zebutal and royalties on sales of nitrolingual pumpspray and tanafed 
there was no comparable royalty expense on tanafed sales in general and administrative expense increased due to additions to our management team and support personnel in our corporate office  higher insurance costs due to increased insurance coverage  higher professional fees related to our public reporting requirements  and higher consulting costs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  or to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher amortization expense related to the acquisition of robinul and robinul forte in january  ponstel on april  and cognex on june   and increased depreciation expense for furniture  computer equipment and leasehold improvements at our corporate headquarters 
research and development expense increased  or to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from continued development of fhpc  our migraine product under development  and the robinul line extension 
in addition  on may   we amended the payment terms under our collaboration agreement with inpharmakon corporation relating to the development of fhpc under the amended terms  we paid a  fee to inpharmakon upon completion of our initial public offering 
interest expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of interest earned on the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering which was completed in may income taxes were provided for in the amount of million at a rate of in compared to  at a rate of in the decreased rate is primarily due to state income tax structuring initiatives 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise from debt service  working capital requirements and funding of acquisitions 
we have met these cash requirements through cash from operations  proceeds from our line of credit  borrowings for product acquisitions and the issuance of common stock 
our cash and cash equivalents were  million and million at december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the sources of cash primarily resulted from net income plus non cash expense and increased accounts payable and accrued expense  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
in  our tax liability was reduced by million due to the exercise of non qualified stock options by employees 
our purchase of inventory impacts our liquidity 
during  we expect to invest cash in the purchase of inventory for our recently acquired product lines and expect we will also experience growth in our accounts receivable as we begin to sell these products which are new to us 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash we expect to generate from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund these working capital requirements 
while some of our supply agreements contain minimum purchase requirements  these minimum purchase requirements are not material to us as in each case our requirements for inventory substantially exceed such minimum purchase requirements 
we expect to use significant cash for operating activities in the future in connection with our development activities 
we have estimated that our research and development expenses through will be approximately million due to continued development work on our proposed migraine product and robinul line extension  planned reformulations of prenate gt and other development initiatives 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
in we purchased the rights to market robinul and robinul forte for million in cash with an additional million financed by the seller  which we paid off in january in april  we purchased the rights to market ponstel for million 
in june  we purchased the rights to market cognex for million in cash 
in august  we purchased the prenate line from sanofi synthelabo for million in cash 
in december  we purchased furadantin and completed a supply agreement from elan for million in cash 
in addition  we purchased   and  of property and equipment in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
during  we borrowed million and incurred indebtedness of million for the purchase of intangible assets 
in  we also made payments of million on long term debt and had a net increase of  on our revolving line of credit 
the primary source of cash in was from our initial public offering and the exercise of stock options that provided net proceeds of million offset by payment on the revolving loan agreement of  and a net repayment of debt of million 
for  the source for cash was the company s follow on offering and the exercise of stock options by employees that together provided net proceeds of million offset by a payment of long term debt of  in january  we borrowed million under a term loan with lasalle bank 
the term loan bore an interest rate at our choice of either the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
on april   the credit facility was further amended to include bridge financing of up to million to finance product acquisitions 
on april   we borrowed million under this bridge loan for the purchase of ponstel 
borrowings under the bridge loan bore interest at our choice of the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
on june   the outstanding balance under this term loan and bridge loan were paid with proceeds from our initial public offering 
on april   we issued a promissory note to pfizer evidencing million of the purchase price of ponstel 
this promissory note was interest free 
we paid this promissory note in full with proceeds from the initial public offering 
on march   we entered into a credit agreement for a senior secured credit facility arranged by deutsche banc alex 
brown inc for million consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving loan to fund the purchase of sular and our working capital requirements 
borrowings under the term loan bear interest at our option at the base rate in effect from time to time plus an applicable margin or the eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin 
the actual interest rate on the term loan approximates based on current eurodollar rates 
the term loan matures in september we are required to apply our net proceeds from any equity or debt financing  sale of assets and certain other events to repayment of the term loan 
borrowings under the revolving loan bear interest at our option at the base rate in effect from time to time plus an applicable margin or the eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin 
the actual interest rate on the revolving loan approximates based on current eurodollar rates 
the revolving loan matures in march  provided that  in the event the term loan is not repaid in full from the proceeds of one or more stock offerings or other junior financing  on or prior to the term loan maturity date  then the revolving loan will mature on the same date as the term loan 
we intend to retire the term loan and reduce borrowings under the revolving loan with the proceeds from our pending public offering 
we are required to reduce our borrowings under the revolving loan facility to not more than million concurrently with our retirement of the term loan 
however  we may thereafter draw the funds under the revolving facility in accordance with its terms 
in addition to the interest described above  our interest expense while the credit facility is outstanding will include the amortization  over the expected life of the facility  of approximately million of financing fees  million of which was paid in connection with our entering into the definitive agreement to acquire sular and million which we paid at the time of our acquisition of sular 
in addition  if we are unable to retire the term loan facility prior to certain dates specified in the loan commitment  we will be required to pay additional fees ranging from approximately  if such term loan has not been retired by may  to an aggregate of approximately million if such term loan facility has not been retired by august  other fees payable by us under such credit facility include an annual administrative fee of  a commitment fee of per annum of the total facility from january  until march  and a fee of after retirement of the term loan of the unused portion of the revolving loan facility 
this credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  including covenants relative to maintaining financial ratios and earnings  limitations on acquisitions  dispositions and capital expenditures  limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and a prohibition on payment of dividends and other payments on our common stock 
in addition  we are required to raise net proceeds of at least million from an equity financing by june and apply such net proceeds to repayment of the term loan 
we intend to use the net proceeds from our pending public offering to retire the term loan and reduce the outstanding balance under our revolving loan to not more than million 
assuming we do not use our existing cash to repay any of these borrowings  we estimate that this will require net proceeds of not less than million to retire the million of indebtedness outstanding under the term loan and repay million of the million indebtedness outstanding under the revolving loan 
to the extent we draw additional funds under the revolving loan to satisfy our liquidity requirements pending completion of this offering  we will be required to raise additional funds to comply with the requirements of our senior secured credit facility 
assuming that we are able to successfully complete our pending public offering and raise net proceeds sufficient to retire the term loan and reduce the indebtedness outstanding under the revolving loan to not more than million  management believes that our cash and cash equivalents  cash to be generated from operations and the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility will be adequate to fund our current working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  in the event that we make significant acquisitions in the future  we may be required to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
if we are unable to successfully complete our pending public offering and raise net proceeds sufficient to retire the term loan and reduce the indebtedness outstanding under the revolving loan to not more than million  we will be required to locate other means to repay or refinance the indebtedness then outstanding under our senior secured credit facility 
we do not currently have a commitment or other means to repay or refinance such facility and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to refinance or repay such facility on acceptable terms  if at all 
inflation we have experienced only moderate price increases under our agreements with third party manufacturers as a result of raw material and labor price increases 
we have generally passed these price increases along to our customers 
seasonality although our business is generally non seasonal  sales of certain products  such as cough and cold products  increase slightly between october and march due to the cold and flu season 
we expect the impact of seasonality to decrease as we acquire or obtain licenses for products that treat chronic conditions 
however  we anticipate that the seasonality may continue to affect sales for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies we view our critical accounting policies to be those policies which are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to estimate the level of accounts receivable recorded in our balance sheet which will ultimately not be paid 
among other things  this assessment requires analysis of the financial strength of our customers  which can be highly subjective  particularly in the recent difficult general economic environment 
our policy is to estimate bad debt expense based on prior experience supplemented by a periodic customer specific review when needed 
sales deductions 
we provide volume rebates  contractual price reductions with drug wholesalers and insurance companies  and certain other sales related deductions on a regular basis 
the exact level of these deductions is not always immediately known and thus we must record an estimate at the time of sale 
our estimates are based on historical experience with similar programs  and since we have a relatively small customer base  customer specific historical experience is often useful in determining the estimated level of deductions expected to be refunded to our customers when sales incentives are offered 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date  which is typically two to three years from the date of manufacture 
management is required to estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of a given product  all of which have been on the market for many years  product specific information provided by our customers and information obtained from independent sources regarding the levels of inventory being held by our customers  as well as overall purchasing patterns by our customers 
intangible assets 
when we acquire the rights to manufacture and sell a product  we record the cash purchase price  along with the value of the product related liabilities we assume  as intangible assets 
we use the assistance of valuation experts to help us allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the various intangible assets we have acquired 
then  we must estimate the economic useful life of each of these intangible assets in order to amortize their cost as an expense in our statement of operations over the estimated economic useful life of the related asset 
the factors that drive the actual economic useful life of a pharmaceutical product are inherently uncertain  and include patent protection  physician loyalty and prescribing patterns  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  future introductions of competing products not yet fda approved  the impact of promotional efforts and many other issues 
we use all of these factors in initially estimating the economic useful lives of our products  and we also continuously monitor these factors for indications of appropriate revisions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our purchases of nitrolingual pumpspray under our agreement with pohl boskamp are made in euros 
our purchases of sular product inventory from bayer will be made in euros 
in addition  sales of cognex are recognized in the foreign currencies of the respective european countries in which it is sold 
while the effect of foreign currency translations has not been material to our results of operations to date  currency translations on export sales or import purchases could be adversely affected in the future by the relationship of the us dollar with foreign currencies 
in connection with borrowings incurred under the senior secured credit facility arranged by deutsche banc alex 
brown inc  we will experience market risk with respect to changes in the general level of the interest rates and its effect upon our interest expense 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at variable rates 
because such rates are variable  an increase in interest rates will result in additional interest expense and a reduction in interest rates will result in reduced interest expense 
accordingly  our present exposure to interest rate fluctuations is primarily dependent on rate changes that may occur while the senior secured credit facility is outstanding

such forward looking statements involve uncertainties and other factors  including those described in the risk factors section of the registration statement under the headings we expect our operating results to be substantially dependent upon our results of operations for sular  and any factor adversely affecting sales of sular could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profits  we may have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of sular  prenate and furadantin and successfully integrating these products into our business  the costs we may incur to sell our new products may be disproportionately high relative to their expected revenues  the potential growth rate for sular may be limited by slower growth for the class of drugs to which sular belongs  we have no experience selling sular  have only limited experience selling furadantin and the prenate products and there is no established market for prenate gt  the regulatory status of prenatal vitamins may make prenate products subject to increased competition  our level of debt could reduce our growth and profitability  if we are unable to timely and successfully complete this offering  we will incur additional expenses  may be required to enter into unfavorable financing arrangements  and may have insufficient liquidity to execute our business strategy  our growth will suffer if we do not acquire rights to new products and integrate them successfully  we depend entirely on third parties to manufacture our products  we may encounter interruptions in our supply of ponstel  we may encounter interruptions in our supply of furadantin  our existing supply agreements may prohibit us from entering into potentially more favorable supply relationships with others  part of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses which subjects us to additional risks  we face competition from generic products that could lower prices and unit sales  strong competition exists for our products  and competitors have introduced new products and therapies that could make our products obsolete  a small number of customers account for a large portion of our sales and the loss of one of them  or changes in their purchasing patterns  could result in reduced sales  if our products under development fail in clinical studies or if we fail or encounter difficulties in obtaining regulatory approval for new products or new uses of existing products  we will have expended significant resources for no return  we or third parties may violate government regulations  if third party payors do not adequately reimburse patients for our products  doctors may not prescribe them  we depend on highly trained management  and we may not be able to keep current management or hire qualified management in the future  product liability claims and product recalls could limit our ability to sell products  we expect to require additional funding and if we cannot obtain it  our sales  profits  acquisitions and development projects could suffer  competitors could offer a product competitive with sular  if we do not secure or enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights  we could encounter increased competition that could adversely affect our operating results  our products could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  which could require us to pay license fees or defend litigation that could be expensive or prevent us from selling products  the regulatory status of some of our products makes these products subject to increased competition and other risks  we face risks under one of our development agreements because the other party to the agreement is a related party  pohl boskamp can terminate our rights to nitrolingual  we have no experience selling products in other countries  there is uncertainty concerning our continued use of arthur andersen llp as our outside auditor and there is uncertainty concerning stockholder approval to increase our authorized common stock
