item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ultrak and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the company is further organized in the us into separate selling divisions all supported by common administrative functions such as credit  accounting  payroll  purchasing  legal  warehousing  training and computer support services 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions among subsidiaries and divisions have been eliminated in consolidation

most of the company s sales are made to its domestic customers on net or net day credit terms after a credit review has been performed to establish creditworthiness and to determine an appropriate credit limit 
the company s international sales are made under varying terms depending upon the creditworthiness of the customer  and include the use of letters of credit  payment in advance of shipment or open trade terms 
cost of sales for most of the company s products includes the cost of the product shipped plus freight  customs and other costs associated with delivery from foreign contract manufacturers or from domestic suppliers

the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between the company s subsidiaries local currencies and the us dollar will affect the conversion of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results 
translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity a substantial portion of the company s purchases and sales are derived from operations outside the united states 
since the revenues and expenses of the company s foreign operations are generally denominated in local currency  exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the us dollar subject the company to currency exchange risks with respect to the results of its foreign operations 
therefore  the company is subject to these risks to the extent that it is unable to denominate its purchases or sales in us dollars or otherwise shift to its customers or suppliers the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
such fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company did not have any foreign exchange forward or currency option contracts outstanding at december  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the company s financial statements  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence  returned inventory deemed not economical to repair or discontinued product lines to its estimated net realizable value 
the estimate is based upon historical results  current and expected sales trends  the amount of current inventories on hand and market conditions 
if market conditions become less favorable than those expected by management  then additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments 
to estimate this allowance  the company analyzes the composition of its accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its goodwill when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
as of december   the method used by the company for this review was the estimate of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the company s goodwill was considered impaired  an impairment charge was recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value 
the company believes its estimates of future cash flows and fair value were reasonable  however  changes in the estimate of such cash flows and fair value could result in future impairment charges 
effective january   the company will adopt statement of financial standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
see section captioned new accounting pronouncements 
deferred income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the realization of net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance 
due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize the net deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance has been recorded at december  against a significant portion of the net deferred tax asset balance 
based on results of operations in future periods  the company may need to adjust the valuation allowance

at december   the company had million outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
the amount outstanding was subsequently reduced to million during the first quarter of during the first three quarters of  the interest rate on the credit facility was adjusted to prime plus a range of to  depending on the leverage ratio and other conditions  determined on a quarterly basis 
as a result of the disputes with lenders described below  interest rates have increased since the end of the third quarter of the rate was fixed at prime plus during the fourth quarter of late in the first quarter of  the rate was subsequently increased to a flat 
the company also pays a monthly fee of per annum based on the average unused borrowing availability under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains certain financial and operational covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a debt service ratio and minimum net worth amounts 
the lenders alleged that the company violated certain of these covenants at various times during  but subsequently waived the alleged defaults 
subsequent to december   an amendment the eighth amendment to the company s revolving credit facility was signed at the insistence of the lenders see exhibit to this form k that increased the interest rate to  reduced the lending commitment from million to million  and accelerated the termination date of the facility from march  to february  the eighth amendment also waived certain alleged defaults by the company under the loan covenants and provided for the payment of certain fees  including fees which the company believes gave it the right to extend the termination date of the facility back to march  although the company paid and the lenders accepted all of the fees prescribed by the eighth amendment  the lenders have asserted the company did not have the right to extend the termination date of the credit facility 
consequently  subsequent to february   the lenders have declared the outstanding balance of the loan to be due  increased the interest rate to  refused to advance funds under the credit facility  and reserved the right to commence foreclosure proceedings if their loan is not repaid in full by april  although the company believes that the actions of the lenders are unwarranted and in breach of their obligations under the credit facility  it expects to repay the loan before such actions are implemented 
the company has received a financing commitment from a new lender that  combined with the tax refund described below  would repay the existing revolving credit facility and provide sufficient funds for the company s operations 
the company and the new lender have approved the terms of the loan documents and the new credit facility is expected to close on april   with funding to follow shortly thereafter 
the company expects to receive during the week of april  a federal income tax refund of approximately million from the job creation and worker assistance act of  signed into law march  this statute allowed the company to carry back its net operating losses to the and tax years  permitting a refund of federal income taxes previously paid for those years 
the act extended the carry back period on net operating losses to five years from two years for losses arising in tax years ending in and inflation during the years ended december   and  the cost of property and equipment  lease expense and salaries and wages increased modestly 
the increases have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations during any of the periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion regarding the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  but maintains an interest swap agreement to hedge against future rate increases 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
foreign exchange the company has foreign based operations  primarily in western europe  which accounted for of and net sales 
the strengthening of the us dollar from to had a negative impact on sales and gross profit 
the majority of inventory purchases were made in us dollars 
this appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an adverse impact of approximately million on gross profit in the company issues intercompany loans to its foreign subsidiaries denominated in us dollars on a long term basis  exposing the foreign subsidiaries to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates of their local currency relative to the us dollar 
the company does not regularly use forward exchange contracts to hedge these exposures 
based on the company s foreign currency exchange rate exposure for intercompany borrowings of approximately million at december   a adverse change in currency rates would increase accumulated other comprehensive loss by approximately million 
interest rates the company s credit arrangements expose it to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december   the company had million outstanding under its revolving line of credit  of which million provided for interest to be paid quarterly based on a variable rate and million provided for a rate fixed by an interest rate agreement 
assuming the debt is refinanced in and the company is no longer assessed interest at the default rates  interest rate changes would result in a change in the amount of interest to be paid each quarter 
based upon the borrowings and swap agreements at december   a increase in interest rates would adversely affect the company s financial position  annual results of operations  or cash flows by approximately million 
because the variable rate structure of the debt exposes us to fluctuation in the interest rates  the company has an interest swap agreement that expires in the agreement provides for a fixed rate of on million
