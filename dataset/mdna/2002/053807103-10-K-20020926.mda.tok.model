critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the company s continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
the company does not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of its business in which revenues are generally recognized upon the actual shipment of product 
accordingly  other than for estimates related to possible returns of products from customers  discounts or rebates  the recording of revenue does not require significant judgments or estimates 
furthermore  revenues and anticipated profits from long term contracts  which are recorded on a percentage of completion basis  are not material to the consolidated results of operations of the company 

table of contents management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to valuation of receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customer defaults 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as through the creation of reserves established for specific customers deemed marginal in their ability to pay based upon contemporaneous factors 
in general  if the financial condition of a customer were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of that customer s ability to make payments to the company  additional reserves may be required 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers governing price protection  stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net foreign operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
special and acquisition related charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  change in control expenses  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
additionally  in assessing the company s goodwill for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows and overall performance of its reporting units 
should these assumptions or the structure of the reporting units change in the future based upon market conditions or changes in business strategy  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges to its remaining goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements located at item of this report for further discussion of sfas and the company s transitional and annual impairment tests 
contingencies and litigation the company is involved in various legal proceedings and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters  all of which arise in the normal course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to these matters  as well 
table of contents as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis by management and internal and  if necessary  external counsel

table of contents results from operations the tables below provide a year over year summary of the results from operations for the company and its operating units 
three year operating unit analysis sales and operating income loss years ended percent change june  of june  of june  of to to total total total dollars in millions sales by operating unit em cm ac sales by geographic area americas emea asia operating income loss by operating unit em cm ac corporate operating income before special charges special charges the results of operations for reflected dramatically different results from the prior year across nearly every category of operational performance 
similarly  the first half of was substantially different than the second half as the significant decline in market conditions referenced previously began in the december quarter the second quarter of fiscal 
the results for the first half of reflected a strong electronic component distribution industry where the company posted both record revenues and earnings 
the results for the second half of and all of were then negatively affected by an abrupt and severe downturn in the electronic components industry  compounded by a general slowdown in the global economic environment 
company results reflect these factors as  despite revenue growth and operating income growth before special items over the course of both and  the company experienced declines in revenues  gross profit margins  operating income margins  net income margins  and for the first time in over four decades  recorded a net loss from continuing operations in most significantly impacted was em  which showed significant deterioration in both sales and operating income before special charges in as compared with and the dramatic drop in sales in is directly related to the sharp decline in semiconductor sales on a global level 
this may also be indicative of a technology industry shift in revenue mix away from the americas  which declined year over year  partly toward the asia region where avnet s operations were also bolstered by the acquisition of sunrise late in 
table of contents enterprise wide operations were impacted by the economic downturn in a number of areas 
revenues continued to be depressed compared with prior year levels due primarily to excess inventory in the supply chain combined with widespread weak demand across the technology segments served by the company 
this impact has been compounded by pricing pressures within the supply chain  common to the industry in a down cycle  which have also kept profits at suppressed levels 
the combination of these factors led to substantially reduced gross profit dollars in the rapid decline in gross profit dollars occurred at a rate greater than operating expenses could be removed from the business and  as a result  each operating group experienced significant declines in operating income in as compared with in addition  operating losses occurred within em in the first and second quarters of and within ac during the fourth quarter of sales on a year over year basis  the company completed with sales of billion  down  or billion  from the record sales of billion recorded in as discussed above  the decrease in consolidated sales was due primarily to the confluence of global and domestic economic forces that caused the severe downturn in the technology markets the company serves 
em sales of billion and cm sales of billion which  combined  represented over of the company s consolidated revenues in  were down from levels by and  respectively 
ac sales of billion in increased marginally by from due primarily to growth in its european operations affected  in part  by a full year of operations of rke systems in  acquired as part of the veba group acquisition discussed in item of this report as well as marginally positive growth in asia 
consolidated sales for of billion were up billion  or  as compared with a significant portion of the increase in sales was primarily due to the robust market conditions that existed through the december timeframe  especially in the telecommunications sectors being fueled by the dot com infrastructure buildup  and the impact of acquisitions 
em sales represented of avnet s consolidated sales in  down from in however  revenue dollars at em year over year grew to record levels of billion in  an increase of billion  or  over sales of billion in this continued increase in sales was due primarily to the impact of acquisitions the veba group of companies and the first full year of operations of marshall and sei and the strengthening of business conditions in the electronics component distribution market 
cm achieved a million  or  increase in sales from billion in to billion in the continued growth rate was primarily impacted by the acquisition of savoir and by growth in sales of enterprise it equipment and services that accompanied the dot com infrastructure buildup in larger companies in the industry that comprise a significant portion of the cm customer base 
em and cm sales for include million of ac sales recorded prior to the period when ac was separated into its own operating group  making ac global sales approximately billion on a pro forma basis for special charges the company recorded a number of special charges during the last three fiscal years 
these charges relate primarily to three items the change in accounting principle further discussed in change in accounting principle goodwill in this md a and in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  charges stemming from acquisition and integration of newly acquired businesses  and the reorganization of operations in each of the three major regions of the world in which the company operates and other non recurring items  generally taken in response to business conditions at the time of the charge 
management believes that the company s future results of operations will continue to benefit from the cost savings resulting from its acquisitions and integrations of new businesses and

in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a special charge representing a write down in value of certain assets acquired in the acquisition of kent and certain other charges taken in response to business conditions 
the special charge totaled million pre tax million included in cost of sales and million included in operating expenses and million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis for the fourth quarter and the year 
the kent related items resulted from the acquisition of kent being accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
under this method  items that normally would have been reflected as adjustments to goodwill as opening balance sheet adjustments if the purchase method of accounting could have been used were instead recorded to the company s consolidated statement of operations 
these items amounted to million pre tax and relate primarily to write downs to the value of receivables considered uncollectible million  excess and obsolete inventory million and property  plant and equipment and non cancelable lease obligations million acquired in the kent acquisition  net of approximately million pre tax in cash recoveries of certain charges recorded as part of the special charges taken in the fourth quarter of the write downs of kent related assets were recorded at the earliest date that management had sufficient information to evaluate the recoverability of the assets in order to conclude that a write down was necessary to record the assets at their net realizable value 
the remaining pre tax special charge recorded in the fourth quarter of  amounting to million  includes an impairment charge of million pre tax to write down certain of the company s investments in unconsolidated internet related businesses to their fair market value and million pre tax for severance charges taken for workforce reductions of approximately personnel announced during the fourth quarter 

table of contents the impairments recorded to the company s investments are considered capital losses for tax purposes and are therefore only deductible to the extent the company has available capital gains 
as there are no capital gains to offset these losses currently or forecasted in the foreseeable future  the company generally has not recorded a tax benefit for these losses 
the timing of the impairment charge to the investments is a function of the timing with which financial and other information regarding these ventures typically becomes available to the company 
although management evaluates these investments for potential impairment throughout the year  a charge to record any impairment is not recorded until management possesses sufficient information to reach a definitive conclusion as to the realizable value of the investments 
of the special charge of million pre tax recorded in the fourth quarter of  million did not require the use of cash and million required the use of cash net of the million in recoveries discussed above  of which million remains unexpended at june  related primarily to remaining payments for severance  substantially all of which is scheduled to be utilized during  and for contractual lease commitments  substantially all of which are expected to be utilized by the end of in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a special charge in connection with the acquisition and integration of kent and for costs related to actions taken in response to business conditions and other restructuring activity 
the charge amounted to million pre tax million included in cost of sales and million included in operating expenses and million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis for the fourth quarter per share for the year 
of the total charge of million  approximately million required an outflow of cash  of which approximately million had been utilized at june  the unutilized portion relates primarily to remaining contractual lease commitments  substantially all of which are expected to be utilized by the end of the unusually large impact on income taxes related to the special charge is due primarily to the non deductibility of certain acquisition related costs and the impact of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 
approximately million of the pre tax charge resulted from the acquisition of kent having been accounted for using the pooling of interests method as described above 
these items consist of costs incurred in completing the acquisition  including significant change in control and other executive benefit related payments made as a result of the acquisition million  professional fees for investment banking  legal and accounting services rendered to both avnet and kent million  as well as adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed million 
the adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed include accruals for severance million  write downs of receivables considered uncollectible million  inventory reserves related to termination of non strategic product lines million  write downs associated with the disposal of fixed assets million  lease terminations million and other items million 
the balance of the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of  amounting to approximately million  related to a number of actions taken to cope with market conditions and to strengthen avnet s operations 
these actions included cost reductions associated with the reorganization of the company s businesses  the integration of the recent acquisitions  as well as important cost cutting actions taken in response to business conditions 
these special charges fall into a number of categories including severance million  inventory reserves related to terminations of non strategic product lines million  inventory valuation adjustments for special inventory purchases to meet customer requirements which were in excess of what was anticipated to be sold or returned million  write downs associated with the disposal of fixed assets million  lease terminations million  adjustments to the book value of investments in unconsolidated entities million and other items million 
during  the company recorded million pre tax million included in operating expenses and million included in cost of sales  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis of incremental special charges associated with the integration of acquired businesses into the company as described below million  the reorganization of em s european operations million  consisting primarily of costs related to the centralization of warehousing operations  the reorganization of em asian operations million and costs incurred in the second quarter in connection with its 
table of contents lawsuit against wyle laboratories  inc and certain individuals million

the charges related to the reorganization of em asia are comprised of severance  inventory reserves required related to supplier terminations  real property lease terminations  employee and facility relocation costs  write downs associated with the disposal of fixed assets  special incentive payments and other items 
the charges related to the reorganization of em s european operations consisted primarily of costs related to the centralization of warehousing operations into the company s new facility in tongeren  belgium 
these charges were for severance  adjustment of the carrying value of fixed assets  real property lease terminations  duplicate employee and property related costs and other items 
the costs incurred pertaining to the wyle lawsuit  in which the company was the plaintiff  related to legal and professional fees associated with the trial of the case  which commenced in september on february   a jury in tampa  florida returned a verdict in the case absolving the defendants of any liability 
subsequently  the parties agreed to settle the case by dismissing all claims and appeals with prejudice and with each side bearing its own costs and expenses 
the company continues to explore potential cost cutting measures including potential reorganizations of certain lines of business 
efforts in this regard may result in future special charges 
such charges will be recorded if and when management makes the necessary decisions and approvals regarding any reorganization plans and liabilities are incurred 
operating income loss the following table compares consolidated gross profit margins  operating expenses as a percent of sales and operating profit margins for the three years ending june  avnet consolidated margin analysis years ended june  june  june  gross profit margins before special charges after special charges operating expense as a percent of sales before special charges after special charges operating profit margins before special charges after special charges consolidated gross profit margins  before special charges  were in as compared with and in and  respectively 
the decline in gross profit margin in from the prior year illustrated the difficult market environment and pressure on average selling prices across the operating groups 
the downward trend also included the effect of business mix increased sales of computer products including microprocessors  drams  disk drives  etc 
that generally have lower gross profit margins than other products in the company s product lines 
the strong gross profit margin performance during was due in part to a mix of business that included a lower percentage of sales during that year to large customers who are typically granted better pricing due to their significant sales volume 
this effect partially offset the impact of pricing 
table of contents pressures on gross profit margins during as the company made the strategic decision to reduce its exposure to larger tier one oem customers whose return on working capital fails to meet company performance requirements 
operating expenses  before special charges  as a percentage of sales increased substantially to during due to the dramatic decline in revenues discussed earlier 
operating expenses in the fourth quarter of reflected an annualized reduction of over million as compared with operating expenses in the december quarter 
this annualized reduction includes a pro forma adjustment to the actual reported expenses in the second quarter of to account for the impact of the operations of the veba group of companies which were acquired partway through that quarter 
however  the revenue declines during that period occurred at an unprecedented rate and faster than management could reasonably remove expense from the business 
operating expenses before special charges  as a percentage of sales  were fairly consistent at and during and  respectively 
the company s operating expenses before special charges  as a percentage of sales  for the entire year reached a record low of due in part to the company s highly successful integration of marshall industries into its em americas operations 
the impact of the synergy benefits was more evident in the first and second quarters of and the fourth quarter of as operating expenses as a percentage of sales fell to a record low of in those quarters 
operating income  before special charges  declined to million in  or of sales  from levels of million  or of sales 
this represented a percentage decline of year over year 
operating profit margins before special charges in deteriorated substantially from and levels 
however  management believes that the combination of cost savings derived from synergies realized from the company s recent acquisitions as well as restructured operations and additional operating expense reductions over the past year  have situated the company with considerable operating leverage when market conditions improve 
management believes that its current operations are well poised for a market upturn  and any material improvement in revenues brought about by more favorable economic and industry conditions should generate operating income growth at a faster rate than both revenue and gross profit dollar growth 
each of the company s operating groups experienced deep year over year declines in operating income 
em s operating income  excluding special charges  was million  down from levels of million 
cm and ac also experienced declines in operating income  excluding special charges  from million and million in  respectively  to levels of million and million  respectively 
including special charges and the results of operations of corporate  the company recorded an operating loss of million 
this compares to consolidated operating income  including special charges  of million and million in and  respectively 
management s actions to improve gross profit margins as well as implement careful expense reductions through the year have created increased operating leverage in the business model 
as a result  excluding special items  the company experienced three consecutive quarterly improvements in operating profit margins through the end of from a low of in the first quarter  operating profit margins improved by

the decrease was due primarily to the reduction of debt as a result of cash generated by reductions in working capital and  to a lesser extent  as a result of lower interest rates on the company s variable rate debt 
the company has reduced its total debt by approximately billion since the end of december interest expense for the fourth quarter of of million was down in comparison to the million of interest expense in the fourth quarter of the decrease in interest expense in the fourth quarter reflected the fifth consecutive quarterly reduction  due principally to the significant reductions of debt discussed above

sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests for goodwill impairment and that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their useful lives 
the company elected early adoption of the provisions of sfas effective june   the first day of the company s fiscal year therefore  the amortization of goodwill was suspended effective on that date 
under the required transitional provisions of sfas  the company identified and evaluated its reporting units for impairment as of june  using a two step process 
the company engaged an outside valuation consultant to assist in this process 
the first step was to ascertain whether there was an indication that any of the company s goodwill was impaired 
this was accomplished by identifying the company s reporting units pursuant to the guidelines set out in sfas and then determining the carrying value of each of those reporting units by assigning the company s assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill  to each of those reporting units as of june  for the purpose of this process  the reporting unit structure was defined as each of the three regional businesses americas  emea and asia for each of the company s operating groups 
the fair value of each reporting unit was determined by using a combination of present value and multiple of earnings valuation techniques 
such fair value was then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit 
as a result of completing the first step of the process  it was determined that there was an impairment of goodwill related to the company s em and cm operations in both emea and asia 
the company identified no impairment of goodwill in the americas region 
in the second step of the process  the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill was compared to its carrying value 
this was done in order to determine the amount of impairment  that is  the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the fair value 
as a result of the valuation process  the company recorded an impairment charge of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for  the charge resulting from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle did not impact cash flow 
the magnitude of the impairment charge was significantly impacted by the timing of the effective date of when the fair value analysis was performed and the designation of the reporting unit structure 
since the company adopted sfas on june   the fair value analysis was required to be completed as of that date 
due to the difficult business and economic conditions at that date  which severely impacted the market sectors in which the company operates  and the uncertainty as to when such conditions would materially improve  the fair value of the company s businesses was significantly less than it might have been at other times 
in other words  in a cyclical business  the timing of a valuation such as this may be an important factor in the outcome of the valuation exercise 
the reporting units with the most significant impairment of goodwill are in europe where the company has not yet generated an acceptable level of profits and cash flows 
in addition  the defined reporting unit structure has resulted in an impairment of goodwill which includes goodwill related to certain recent acquisitions that otherwise might not have been impaired 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow the table below highlights cash flow activity in and provides comparisons with the prior two years 
cash flow generated from operating activities in increased substantially over  generated primarily by working capital reductions that are common in avnet s business during down cycles

under the program  the company sells receivables in securitization transactions and retains a subordinated interest and servicing rights to those receivables

covenants and conditions the multi year and day credit agreements described above contain certain covenants with various limitations on total debt  capital expenditures and investments and require that net worth  interest coverage and other ratios be maintained at specific levels 
similarly  the receivable securitization program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold under the program 
if these conditions are not met  the company may not be able to borrow any additional funds under these facilities and the lenders generally have the right to accelerate any amounts outstanding 
circumstances that could affect the company s ability to meet the required financial covenants and conditions in its various financing arrangements include the duration and depth of the current economic downturn and the impact on profitability  perceived financial strength or weakness by credit rating agencies and various other economic  market and industry factors 
the company was in compliance with all covenants for these facilities at june  the company is also required to maintain minimum senior unsecured credit ratings in order to continue using the receivable securitization program in its present form 
if the company s credit rating is reduced below baa and bbb by moody s investors services  inc and standard and poor s  respectively  the company may be in default under the securitization program 
the company is in compliance with these minimum unsecured credit ratings currently and as of june  however  in the event of a continued economic downturn or a weaker than expected recovery  the company s prospects of a lowered credit rating on its senior unsecured debt would become more likely 
both the syndicated bank facility and the securitization program contain certain standard cross default provisions  meaning that if there is a default under one facility  such as a covenant breach or a credit ratings trigger  that default can also trigger a default under the other facility 
in the case of any default  the company would either have to negotiate with the lenders to modify the facility or pay off all amounts outstanding  terminate the facility and  if necessary  seek alternative financing 
under its current financing arrangements the company has an aggregate of approximately million in additional borrowing capacity at june  approximately million of that capacity expires in october under its current day facility and it is management s intention to terminate this facility by its expiration date 
management believes its current borrowing capacity  even after termination of the day facility  and its ability to generate cash from normal operations are sufficient to meet its projected working capital requirements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
the company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the company has used interest rate swaps that convert certain fixed rate debt to variable rate debt  effectively hedging the change in fair value of the fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
at june   the company has two interest rate swaps outstanding under which the company pays a variable interest rate and receives a fixed interest rate 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of the company s debt outstanding at june  dollars in millions total at there june  fair value at after june  liabilities fixed rate debt average interest rate floating rate debt average interest rate interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate libor average receive rate many of the company s subsidiaries  on occasion  purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with the fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the company adjusts all foreign denominated balances and any outstanding foreign exchange contracts to fair market value through the consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the market risk related to foreign exchange contracts is offset by changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the asset or liability representing the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is classified in the captions other current assets or accrued expenses and other  as applicable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates under the remaining contracts would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts at june   which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged positions
