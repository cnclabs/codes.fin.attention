such statements  which include statements concerning the timing of availability and functionality of products under development  trends in average selling prices  the percentage of export sales  outcome of pending litigation  demand for and trends in revenue for our products  devotion of resources and control of expenses related to new products  markets and internal business strategies  are subject to risks and uncertainties  including those set forth below under factors that may affect our results and elsewhere in this report  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof 
we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto 
overview of business we design  develop and market very large scale integrated circuits ic for videographics  multi media and digitally processed television products for the desktop and notebook personal computer pc and consumer television market 
our graphics and video controllers typically are sold with software drivers  a bios basic input output system and related system integration support 
our strategy is to apply our design expertise  which helped us succeed in the market for super video graphics array svga graphics controllers and graphical user interface gui accelerators  to other high volume graphics  multimedia and digitally processed television markets for the general mass public  acceleration of digital versatile disc dvd based live video playback  and three dimensional d display for game and entertainment application markets 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  equity investments  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions  historical returns  inventory levels at distributors and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 

table of contents we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus  four of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages that consolidated statement of operations items are to revenues for the years ended june   and year ended june  revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative income loss from operations gain loss on investments  net interest income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss revenues the sales of pcs have slowed in recent periods 
our revenues have declined in fiscal year  and we cannot predict when or if this slowdown will be reversed 
any significant revenue growth in graphics revenue depends to a substantial extent on an improvement in the pc market 
net product sales decreased in fiscal to million  or  from million reported in fiscal the decrease in net product sales was primarily due to the decrease in unit volume shipments of desktop and notebook products in fiscal sales of notebook products of million were approximately of total revenues in fiscal as compared to million or of total revenues in fiscal sales of gui desktop products were approximately million or of total revenues in fiscal as compared to approximately million or in fiscal sales of 
table of contents digitally processed television products represented approximately million or of total revenues in fiscal as compared to approximately million or in fiscal total revenues in fiscal increased to million  or  from million reported in fiscal net product sales increased in fiscal to million  or  from million reported in fiscal the increase in net product sales was primarily due to an increase in unit volume shipments of notebook products having higher average selling prices 
royalty and license revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal resulting primarily from a final payment from via in settlement of our litigation against via for products sold prior to march  we did not recognize the royalties in earnings until the quarter ended december  when the disputes were settled and the collectibility was assured 
sales of notebook products of million were approximately of total revenues in fiscal as compared to million or of total revenues in fiscal sales of gui desktop products were approximately million or of total revenues in fiscal as compared to approximately million or in fiscal we design products with the goal of filling the needs of leading pc systems manufacturers as well as the needs of adapter card manufacturers 
sales to asian customers  primarily in japan and taiwan  accounted for of net sales in fiscal sales to asian customers  primarily in hong kong  taiwan  japan  the philippines  thailand and singapore  accounted for of net sales in fiscal sales to asian customers  primarily in hong kong  taiwan  korea  japan  and singapore accounted for of net sales in fiscal sales to one customer  inno micro  which is a supplier of toshiba  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal sales to three customers  inno micro  which is a supplier of toshiba  and quanta and arima  which are suppliers of compaq  accounted for approximately  and of net sales for fiscal  respectively 
sales to three customers  compaq  fujitsu  and toshiba accounted for approximately   and of net sales for fiscal  respectively 
substantially all of the sales transactions were denominated in us dollars during all periods 
in fiscal year our sales to distributors were negligible 
sales to distributors represented and of net sales during the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
we plan to develop new and higher performance graphics controllers and multimedia products to sell to existing customers as well as new customers in asia  north america and europe 
our future success depends upon our successful introduction of these and other new products on a regular and timely basis and upon those products meeting customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the development of new products or to commence shipments of new products in a timely manner  or that product specifications will not change during the development period 
in addition  even if such new products are successfully developed and shipped  there can be no assurance that they will be successful in the marketplace 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to an increase in the cost of production of notebook chips 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal excluding the royalty and license revenue  our gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to an increase in the cost of the production of notebook chips 
we believe that the prices of high technology products will decline over time as competition increases and new and more advanced products are introduced 
we expect average selling prices of existing products to continue to decline  although the average selling prices of our entire product line may remain constant or increase as a result of introductions of new higher performance products often with additional functionality which are planned to have higher margins 
our strategy is to maintain and improve gross margins by developing new products that have higher margins  and reducing manufacturing costs by improving production yield and utilizing newer process technology 
there is no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis or that we can reduce manufacturing costs 
our revenues are substantially dependent on significant sales of the xp and increases in sales of pcs in general 
without those  we do not expect our revenues to increase 
we currently do not expect revenues to increase over the next two quarters  and we expect to incur losses over those quarters 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal 
table of contents  and decreased from million in fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in the amount spent in fiscal was primarily the result of increased headcount relating to our efforts in developing advanced graphic and digitally processed television products such as our newest graphic chip the xp and our digitally processed television chip dptv d 
we are in the process of developing our next generation d graphics technology 
the new technology  which we call xp  will be used in both the discrete and integrated products 
our graphics product development strategy is to focus on a balanced design with consideration of not only high performance  but also low cost and low power consumption 
we also plan to continue developing the next generation dptv product as well as other advanced products for digital tv and digital set top boxes stb for the digital television market in china  japan  korea and taiwan 
however  there can be no assurance that these products will be quickly or widely accepted by consumers in the market place  or that the new products will be developed and shipped in a timely manner 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
selling expenses were million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
selling costs increased in fiscal due to higher sales representative commissions for our integrated notebook products 
selling costs declined in fiscal and fiscal due to a decline in headcount and sales representative commissions 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in legal expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in headcount of administrative personnel 
interest income  net the amount of interest income earned by us varies directly with the amount of our cash and cash equivalents balances and the prevailing interest rates 
net interest income decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal due to lower cash balances and declining interest rates in money market accounts 
net interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to lower cash balances in higher yielding money market accounts 
provision benefit for income taxes the benefit of income taxes amounted to million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
in both years  the income tax benefit was primarily due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the write downs of our investment in united microelectronics corporation umc 
the provision for income taxes amounted to million for the fiscal year ended june   due primarily to the deferred tax provision for the unrealized capital gain in the investments in umc 
gain loss on investments  net on january   umc acquired united integrated circuits corporation uicc  a company in which we had previously made an investment 
we recorded a pre tax gain of million as a nonoperating gain in investment in our statement of operations during the year ended june  the gain represents the difference between the cost of our previous investment in uicc and the quoted market value of the umc shares listed on the taiwan stock exchange as of the date umc acquired uicc 
as of june   we owned approximately million shares of umc which represents about of the outstanding stock of umc 
in the quarter ended september   we concluded that due to a substantial decline in the market value of umc s stock price from june   the continued decline in stock prices of publicly traded semiconductor companies and the continuing unfavorable outlook for the semiconductor industry  that the decline in the investment value in umc had become other than temporary 
accordingly  million  which represents the difference between the carrying value on march  and the quoted fair value on september   was written off against earnings as an impairment 
table of contents loss on investments in accordance with statements of financial accounting sfas no 
and accounting principles board opinion apb no 
see part iv  item  note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of this investment and the related losses 
during the fiscal year ended june   we also recognized net impairment loss on investments other than umc totaling million as follows in thousands adsl company communications company broadband communications company voice over dsl communications company optical networking company broadband server technology company venture capital funds system design software company net loss during the three months ended june   we recognized a gain on investment of  resulting from the acquisition by a public company of a software design company in which we had invested  see part iv  item  note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of these investments and the related losses 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of june   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  decreased from million at june  in fiscal year  million of cash was used by operations  as opposed to fiscal year  during which  of cash was provided by operations 
the cash used by operations was primarily due to the operating loss and decrease in accounts payable  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories 
accounts receivable decreased to million at june  from million at june  the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to a decrease in revenues in the fourth quarter 
revenues decreased to million in the three months ended june  from million in the three months ended march  inventories decreased to million at june  from million at june  primarily due to the reduction of our orders for product manufacturing during the fiscal year ended june  the decrease is also a result of changing our product mix to integrated notebook products  which are purchased on a just in time basis  further lowering our inventory level 
accounts payable decreased to million at june  from million at june  the decrease is mainly a reflection of our continued reduction in purchases during the fiscal year ended june  capital expenditures in fiscal   and were million  million and million  respectively 
other significant cash outflows from investing and financing activities for the year ended june  represented the purchases of long term investments of million and treasury stock of million 
we occupy our facilities under several non cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through  and require payment of property taxes  insurance  maintenance and utilities 
future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases at june  were as follows in thousands years ending june total minimum lease payments as of june   we had unconditional purchase order commitments of approximately million for wafers and chipsets 
on april   our board of directors approved an extension to april  of the million stock repurchase program  originally approved in april during fiscal years   and    and  shares of common stock were repurchased for million  million  and million under this program  respectively 
in october  our board of directors authorized a one year budget of million allowing our president and executive officers to make equity investments in companies  with no more than million in any one company or technology 
as of june  cumulative purchases of investments totaled million 
substantially all of these investments are in private companies developing technologies in areas in which we are focusing 
on april   we and via technologies  inc announced that we had agreed to resolve all pending litigation 
we recognized million in royalty revenue during the quarter ended december   offset by costs of million  related to the litigation settlement with via technologies inc the million  which via agreed to pay us as part of the settlement of litigation  was related to products sold prior to march  we sued via because via did not pay royalties to us when the products were sold 
we did not recognize the royalties in earnings until the disputes and litigation regarding our right to collect were settled in the quarter ended december  
table of contents as of june   the market value of our short term investment in umc was million 
in addition  we held million in stock which was not available for resale as it is subject to certain contractual and other restrictions 
we acquired the shares we hold in umc as a result of a transaction we engaged in for the purpose of obtaining additional foundry capacity for our operations 
in order to preserve our wafer capacity guarantee with umc  there are certain limitations on our ability to sell the umc shares 
if our total shareholdings fall below one half of their initial percentage of shares  our production capacity will be reduced by at least  and depending on the interpretation of the foundry capacity agreement between the parties  our production capacity could be reduced by substantially more than 
in addition  one third of the shares is subject to a two year lock up period in accordance with an investment agreement entered into with umc 
after a two year period  one fifth of the shares will be available for sale from the lock up portion every six months 
as of june   approximately million shares are subject to this lock up restriction 
while we are an operating company and not in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities  we do intend to monitor the advisability of disposing of our umc stock and intend to sell all or part of the stock when it is in the best interests of our shareholders to do so 
we believe our current resources are sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
we regularly consider transactions to finance our activities  including debt and equity offerings and new credit facilities or other financing transactions 
we believe our current reserves are adequate 

table of contents factors that may affect our results we incurred an operating loss in fiscal we incurred an operating loss of million in the fiscal year ended june  future performance will substantially depend upon numerous factors  such as whether there is improvement in pc sales  notebook and digital media sales in particular  timely introduction of new products and product enhancements to the marketplace  whether customers successfully incorporate our technologies into end products with high levels of customer acceptance  fluctuating price levels for our products 
we are trying to expedite new product launchings and to control operating expenses 
however  there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful 
sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses may increase as a result of shifts in the market place  our efforts in developing and marketing new products such as dptv d and xp and our need to respond to these shifts  which could result in the need to generate significantly higher revenue to achieve and sustain profitability 
we have had fluctuations in quarterly results in the past and will continue to do so in the future 
we plan to control our operating expenses relating to any expansion of our sales and marketing activities  broadening of our customer support capabilities  development of new distribution channels  and any increase in our research and development capabilities 
however  our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors including uncertain demand in new markets in which we have limited experience  fluctuations in demand for our products  including seasonality  unexpected product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and to manage product transitions  new product introductions by our competitors  our ability to achieve required cost reductions  our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products  delayed new product introductions  unfavorable responses to new products  adverse economic conditions  particularly in asia  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold  availability of foundry and assembly capacities  delay of joint development efforts due to unexpected market conditions  and length of sales cycle 
to be successful  we must continue to develop new products and to enhance our existing products 
the graphics controller industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our future success depends on our ability to anticipate market needs and develop products that address those needs 
as a result  our products could quickly become obsolete if we fail to predict market needs accurately or develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner 
any return to profitability and long term success in the graphics business will depend on the introduction of successive generations of products in time to meet the design cycles as well as to specifications of pc manufacturers 
our failure to predict market needs accurately or to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner will harm market acceptance and sales of our products 
if the development or enhancement of these products or any other future products takes longer than we anticipate  or if we are unable to introduce these products to market  our sales will not increase 
even if we are able to develop and commercially 
table of contents introduce these new products  the new products may not achieve widespread market acceptance necessary to provide an adequate return on our investment 
we currently rely on a few key accounts for a significant portion of our revenue 
to date  a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
although our largest customers may vary from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a small number of customers 
our distributor and customer agreements generally are not exclusive  there is no obligation to renew agreements  and minimum purchases are generally not required 
the significant terms of our agreements with distributors are as follows the products are shipped by us to a distributor with terms of fob shipping point  with risk of loss transferring to the distributor upon delivery of the products by us to the common carrier 
payment terms are net days 
the distributors return privileges are in the form of stock rotation and warranty and return resulting from functionality and quality issues for one year 
we currently rely on certain international customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 
our revenues have historically been generated primarily from asian customers  particularly customers in taiwan  and japan 
while we intend to continue our marketing efforts to north american oems  we expect to be primarily dependent on international sales and operations  particularly in taiwan  japan and china  which are expected to constitute a significant portion of our sales in the future 
of our total sales for the year ending june  were indirectly and directly sold to toshiba 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business which could adversely affect future results  including potentially longer accounts receivable collection cycles  import or export licensing requirements  potential adverse tax consequences  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
our international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
intense competition exists in the market for graphics controllers 
the graphics controller industry in the sub  pc segment has experienced reduced margins due to a number of factors including competitive pricing pressures  processing difficulties and rapid technological change 
we anticipate that the discrete graphics controller demand from sub  pc s will continuously decrease in the future  while the demand for integrated graphics controllers will increase 
also  there is intense competition in the notebook graphics controller market 
we compete in the notebook controller market with competitors such as ati technologies  nvidia corporation  via s  and intel 
therefore  to maintain our revenue and gross margin  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product cost 
our failure to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could have a materially adverse affect on our operating results 
the market for graphics controllers is intensely competitive 
many of our current competitors in graphics have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and market share than we do 
to remain competitive  we believe we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products  including products for new markets  increasing the ability of our products to integrate various functions and enhancing quality product performance 
if we fail to do so  our products may not compete favorably with those of our competitors  which could have a materially adverse affect on our revenue and future profitability 
we are in the process of developing and introducing our next generation d graphics technology 
the new technology  which we call xp  will be used in both the discrete and integrated products 
our graphics product development strategy is to focus on a totally balanced design with consideration of not only high performance  but also low cost and low power consumption 

table of contents intense competition exist in the market for digital media products 
we also plan to continue developing the next generation dptv product as well as other advanced products for digital tv and digital stb for the digital television market in china  japan  korea and taiwan 
we believe the market for digital television will be competitive  and will require substantial research and development  sales and other expenditures to stay competitive in this market 
in the digital television market our principal competitors are toshiba  philips electronics  and micronas ag 
however  we believe that dptv products will have a longer product life cycle than other current products 
therefore we expect to devote significant resources to the dptv market even though competitors are substantially more experienced than we are in this market 
we are vulnerable to undetected product problems 
although we establish and implement test specifications  impose quality standards upon our suppliers and perform separate application based compatibility and system testing  our products may contain undetected defects  which may or may not be material  and which may or may not have a feasible solution 
we have experienced such errors in the past  and we cannot ensure that such errors will not be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may materially adversely affect our business by causing us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and causing significant customer relations problems 
in part due to pricing and other pressures in the pc graphics market and in the desktop market in particular  we are developing products for introduction in non pc markets 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in eliminating undetected defects in these new products which may or may not be material 
we rely upon independent foundries to manufacture our products 
if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow could limit our revenue  adversely affect our competitive position and reputation and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders under agreements with our customers 
we currently rely on a limited number of third party foundries to manufacture our products either in finished form or wafer form 
generally  these foundries are not obligated to manufacture our products on a long term fixed price base  however  due to the company s investment in one foundry  a certain level of guaranteed wafer capacity does exist 
if we encounter shortages and delays in obtaining components  our ability to meet customer orders could be materially adversely affected 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from a contract manufacturer in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
such delays often result in purchasing at a higher per unit product cost from other foundries or the payment of expediting charges so that we can obtain the required supply in a timely manner 
we may in the future experience delays in shipments from foundries or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be volatile 
factors such as new product announcements by us or our competitors  quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and unfavorable conditions in the graphics controller market may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 

table of contents these conditions  as well as factors that generally affect the market for stocks in general and stocks in high technology companies in particular  could cause the price of our stock to fluctuate from time to time 
our success depends to a significant degree on the continued employment of key personnel 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of the principal members of our technical sales  marketing  engineering and management personnel  many of whom perform important management functions and would be difficult to replace 
we particularly depend upon the continued services of our executive officers  particularly frank lin  our president and chief executive officer  dr 
jung herng chang  senior vice president  engineering  and peter jen  our senior vice president  asia operations and other key engineering  sales  marketing  finance  manufacturing and support personnel 
in addition  we depend upon the continued services of key management personnel at our overseas subsidiaries 
our officers and key employees are not bound by employment agreements for any specific term  and may terminate their employment at any time 
in addition  we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
in order to continue to expand our product offerings both in the us and abroad  we must hire a number of research and development personnel 
hiring technical sales personnel in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our technologies 
our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future 
competition for highly skilled personnel is intense  particularly in northern california 
we may also have difficulty hiring experienced and skilled engineers at our research and development facility in taiwan and china 
if we are not successful in attracting  assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs  our business may be harmed 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  which may be difficult 
the graphics controller market is a highly competitive industry in which we  and most other participants  rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect proprietary rights 
the competitive nature of our industry  rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards heighten the importance of protecting proprietary technology rights 
since the united states patent and trademark office keeps patent applications confidential until a patent is issued  our pending patent applications may attempt to protect proprietary technology claimed in a third party patent application 
our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies as policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our technologies  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as us law 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any of our patents or other intellectual property 
if we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology rights  others may be able to use our proprietary technology without having to compensate us  which could reduce our revenues and negatively impact our ability to compete effectively 
we have filed a number of lawsuits to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others 
as a result of any such litigation  we could lose our proprietary rights and incur substantial unexpected operating costs 
any action we take to protect our intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention 
in addition  failure to adequately protect our trademark rights could impair our brand identity and our ability to compete effectively 
we are currently involved in intellectual property infringement claims  and may be involved in others in the future  which can be costly 
our industry is very competitive and is characterized by frequent litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
numerous patents in our industry have already been issued and as the market further develops and additional intellectual property protection is obtained by participants in our industry  litigation is likely to become more frequent 
from time to time  third parties have asserted and are likely in the future to assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies or rights that are important to our business 

table of contents we are currently involved in such disputes with neomagic and others 
see part ii  item legal proceedings 
in addition  we may in the future enter into agreements to indemnify our customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
our pending litigation and any future litigation arising from claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  whether the litigation is with or without merit  has been and may in the future be  time consuming  resulting in significant expenses and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
we do not have insurance against our alleged or actual infringement of intellectual property of others 
these claims  if resolved adversely to us  could cause us to stop selling our products which incorporate the challenged intellectual property and could also result in product shipment delays or require us to redesign or modify our products or to enter into licensing agreements 
these licensing agreements  if required  would increase our product costs and may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if there is a successful claim of infringement or we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis  our business could be harmed 
the california energy crisis could lead to increasing operating expenses 
we rely on the major northern california public utility  pacific gas electric company  or pg e  to supply electric power to our headquarters facility in sunnyvale  california 
due to problems associated with the deregulation of the power industry in california and shortages in wholesale electricity supplies  customers of pg e may face increased electricity prices  power shortages and rolling blackouts 
increased energy prices will increase our operating expenses which will decrease our profits 
natural disasters could limit our ability to supply products 
our primary suppliers are located in california and taiwan  both active earthquake fault zones 
these regions have experienced large earthquakes in the past and may experience them in the future 
a large earthquake in any of these areas could disrupt our manufacturing operations for an extended period of time  which would limit our ability to supply our products to our customers in sufficient quantities on a timely basis  harming our customer relationships 
future terrorist attacks may affect our business 
we cannot guarantee that our business will be unaffected by terrorist attacks in the future 
the impact and future effects of terrorism are currently uncertain  and we are unable to predict the future impact that terrorist attacks may have on our business and operations  the international markets in which we operate and the global economy in general 
dilution of shareholders interest may occur 
as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
we are very aggressively seeking investment opportunities in new businesses  and we expect to make investments in and may acquire businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership 
these actions could affect our operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risk associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 

table of contents we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
changes in our business organization could affect our operations 
on january   our board of directors approved a spin off of our trident technologies inc subsidiary and our trident multimedia technologies shanghai co 
ltd 
subsidiary 
it is our belief that these subsidiaries will operate more efficiently if their operations were managed as independent entities 
the trident technologies  inc subsidiary is developing the liquid crystal display lcd panel video controller chip product 
the trident multimedia technologies shanghai co 
ltd

the structure and timing of these spin offs  and the nature of the operations at the time of spin off will depend on a number of organizational  operational and marketing factors 
we have not made all of the decisions necessary to complete these spin offs  and the spin offs may not occur in while we intend to structure the transactions in a manner to enhance our overall operations  the spin offs will dilute the interests of our shareholders in the operations of the spun off entities and  particularly if the spin offs do not increase their revenue and profitability  could adversely affect our financial results 
the performance of our equity investments is currently uncertain 
we maintain an investment portfolio including minority equity investments in several publicly traded companies 
generally  these investments are made to more closely align our interests with those of potential strategic partners 
the values of these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we have also made investments in a number of privately held companies  many of which are in the early development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we have in the past incurred losses on our investments 
in the future  we could further lose a portion of or our entire investment in these companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we currently maintain our cash equivalents primarily in money market funds and highly liquid marketable securities 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
as of june   million of our investments matured in less than three months 
we will continue to invest a significant portion of our existing cash equivalents in interest bearing  investment grade securities  with maturities of less than twelve months 
we do not believe that our investments  in the aggregate  have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
exchange rate risk we currently have operations in the united states  taiwan and china 
the functional currency of all our operations is the us dollar 
though some expenses are incurred in local currencies by our taiwan and china operations  substantially all of our transactions are made in us dollars  hence  we have minimal exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations relating to our transactions 
while we expect our international revenues to continue to be denominated predominately in us dollars  an increasing portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future 
in addition  
table of contents we plan to continue to expand our overseas operations 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we will analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations  however  exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future 
investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments in public companies 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies for business and strategic purposes and we have classified these securities as available for sale 
these available for sale equity investments  primarily in technology companies  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
we have realized significant gains and losses on our equity investments 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recognized a pre tax gain on investments of million  primarily related to a million gain on receiving shares in umc in exchange for shares we held in uicc  a private company 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recognized a pre tax loss of million of which million related to a decline in the market value of shares in umc that we concluded was other than temporary 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recognized a pre tax loss of million of our investments in public companies of which million related to a decline in the market value of shares in umc that we concluded was other than temporary 
as of june   we had available for sale equity investments with a fair market value of million including million related to shares of umc 
our objective in managing our exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to our earnings and cash flows 
there are  however  a number of factors beyond our control 
continued market volatility  as well as mergers and acquisitions  have the potential to have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods 
we are also exposed to changes in the value of our investments in non public companies  including start up companies 
these long term equity investments in technology companies are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the industries in which these companies participate and other factors 
as of june  the balance of our long term equity investments in non public companies was million
