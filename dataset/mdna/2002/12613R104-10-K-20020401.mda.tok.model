during the fourth quarter of  we completed our acquisition of zdnet 
subsequent to the acquisition  we incurred costs related to integrating the operations of zdnet with our operations through the integration of duplicative businesses 
throughout as part of the integration process  we evaluated our staffing requirements related to a more challenging business environment and focused on increasing efficiencies in our operations 
we initiated reductions in our global workforce during resulting in the elimination of approximately of our workforce

these revenues and marketing expenses were recognized at the fair value of the advertisements received and delivered  and the corresponding revenues and marketing expenses were recognized when the advertisements were delivered

the increase in depreciation expenses of from to related primarily to capital additions of million and an increase in fixed assets due to acquisition 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles relates to the goodwill and intangibles we record for companies we have acquired for which we use the purchase method of accounting 
goodwill and intangibles amortization expenses were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in over was primarily due to the full year impact of the amortization of goodwill associated with the zdnet acquisition  which occurred in october goodwill impairment due to the significant decline in our stock price once trading reopened after the events of september th  the overall continued decline in market values of businesses in the media industry  and the continued further decline in the overall markets  we believed that there was an indication that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable 
at the end of the third quarter of  we evaluated whether an impairment had occurred by comparing the carrying value of these assets to undiscounted and without interest charges future cash flows 
this recoverability analysis indicated that there had been an impairment to our enterprise wide goodwill 
therefore  a charge of billion was taken during the third quarter of to adjust the carrying value of these assets to their fair value

we had income before income taxes of million in in  we recorded a tax provision of million 
effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the income tax benefit recorded in was lower than the statutory rates primarily due to million of nondeductible amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  for which no tax benefit was recognized

in addition at december   we had capital lease obligations outstanding of million related to the purchase of equipment 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods s less than after december  total year years years long term debt non cancellable operating lease obligations capital lease obligations the liability for abandoned leases at december  of million over the next four years for future cash expenditures related to abandoned facilities is included in the above table under the caption non cancelable operating lease obligations 
the operating lease obligations presented above have not been reduced for the difference between the expected cash outflows from our lease obligations and the expected cash inflows from sublease income related to these vacated properties 
we believe that existing funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months 
we do not anticipate the need for additional funding in the foreseeable future 
however  any acquisitions completed in the future that would require cash funding may affect our liquidity and funding needs 
although we have not presently identified alternate or additional sources of long term capital  if our cash needs were to change  or if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow for operations by when our convertible subordinated notes are due  we will need to raise additional capital through debt or equity offerings in the public or private markets 
our ability to raise such additional capital will depend on market conditions at that time 
the following items are contingencies  which may affect our liquidity in future periods 
in conjunction with the zdnet acquisition  we assumed a guarantee of the obligations of ziff davis media inc under a new york city office lease for a total of  square feet 
in connection with that guarantee  we also have a letter of credit for million outstanding as a security deposit 
the letter of credit is secured by cash and is recorded as restricted cash in our balance sheet 
this lease expires in the average cost per square foot is approximately thirty dollars over the remaining term of the lease 
through a sublease from ziff davis media inc  we currently occupy  square feet of the office space covered under this lease 
ziff davis media inc currently occupies  square feet of this space 
there are two additional sublessees  the bank of new york and softbank  who collectively occupy a total of  square feet 
as of december   the total minimum lease payments remaining until the end of the lease term were million  excluding the amounts attributable to our sublease 
if the financial condition of any of the sublessees or the primary lessee were to deteriorate and thereby result in an inability to make their lease payments  we would be required to make additional lease payments under the guarantee 
in august  the simon property group spg filed a trademark infringement suit against mysimon  inc  a subsidiary of cnet acquired on february   in federal district court in indianapolis 
spg alleged that the mysimon trademark infringed spg s simon trademark 
on august   following a trial on the subject  the jury found in favor of spg and awarded damages against mysimon in the amount of million in compensatory damages  million for corrective advertising  and million in punitive damages 
on september   the court entered an order establishing an escrow for royalties pending final resolution of the litigation where mysimon pays into escrow of its gross cash receipts each month 
on january   the judge eliminated the million compensatory damages award  reduced the million punitive damages award to the statutory minimum of  and offered spg the opportunity to accept ten dollars a remittitur for damages attributable to corrective advertising in exchange for immediate entry of judgment for the entire case in lieu of a re trial on the subject of corrective advertising 
on february   spg filed its election to seek a retrial on the issue of corrective advertising in lieu of the ten dollar remittur 
under indiana law  the amount of punitive damages is capped at the greater of three times compensatory damages or  accordingly  it is not possible to determine the amount of punitive damages  if any  that may be payable until the issue of damages for corrective advertising has been resolved 
it is not possible to predict the amount of damages attributable to corrective advertising that could be awarded in a re trial  however such amounts  if settled adversely to us  could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
on december   mysimon filed a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence it believes spg should have produced prior to the august trial 
discovery surrounding the new evidence is ongoing

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  investments  goodwill and intangible assets  lease abandonment  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues once the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of our obligation to our customer has occurred the price to be charged to the buyer is fixed or determinable collectibility of the fees to be charged is reasonably assured we have several revenue streams 
for each revenue stream  evidence of the arrangement  delivery and pricing may be different 
for all revenue streams  we determine that collectibility is reasonably assured through a standardized credit review to determine each customer s credit worthiness 
we recognize revenues from the sale of our interactive messaging and banner advertisements on our online network in the period in which the advertisements are delivered 
the arrangements are evidenced either by insertion order or contract  which stipulate the types of advertising to be delivered and pricing 
our customers are billed based on a discounted list price with no amounts subject to refund 
when recognizing revenues  the discounts granted are applied to each type of advertisement purchased based on the relative fair value of each element without regard to the discount 
we refer to the fees charged to merchants based on the number of users who click on an advertisement or text link to visit websites of our merchant partners as leads 
for leads  the arrangement is evidenced by a contract that stipulates the lead fee 
the fee becomes fixed and determinable upon delivery of the lead 
these revenues are recognized in the period in which the leads are delivered to the merchant  and are therefore not subject to refund 
advertising revenues from our print publications are recognized in the month that the related publications are sent to subscribers or become available at newsstands 
revenues for subscriptions to these publications are recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period 
newsstand revenue from our print publications is recognized when the publications are delivered to the newsstand at which time a reserve is recorded against the value of the publications delivered based on the number of magazines that we expect to be returned 
to ensure these reserves are adequate  we review the sell through history of the publications on a monthly basis 
customers of cnet channel enter into contracts that allow access to the product database and product procurement services for a specified period of time 
upon execution of a contract and billing for the services  we record deferred revenue for the entire fee 
this deferred revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the arrangement 
the amounts under the contract are not refundable after the customer has used the service 
on occasion  we enter into revenue arrangements that involve both customers and other unrelated third parties 
we determine whether to recognize such revenues on a gross or net basis depending on whether we are the primary obligor  determine the pricing  bear the financial risk and other factors outlined in the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we trade advertising on our internet sites in exchange for advertisements on the internet sites of other companies 
these revenues are recognized in the period in which the advertisements are delivered based on the fair market value of the services delivered 
we determine the fair market value of the service delivered based upon amounts charged for similar services in non trade deals within the previous six month period 
collectibility of receivables we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our allowances on periodic assessment of our customer s liquidity and financial condition through credit rating agencies reports  financial statement reviews and historical collection trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and thereby result in an inability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
carrying value of investments we identify and record impairment losses on investments when events and circumstances indicate that such decline in fair value is other than temporary 
this review and evaluation process is performed on an ongoing basis for all marketable equity securities owned by us 
declines in value of marketable equity securities are determined to be other than temporary when the securities have consistently traded below carrying value for a nine month period  and general market conditions or specific circumstances relating to a security indicate that the security will not recover its carrying value 
additionally  impairment is assessed routinely on privately held investments based  where possible  on the pricing of new rounds of financing for the individual company  cash resources  liquidity  and other subjective factors such as  our estimate of the strength of the underlying business and assets including technology and intangibles 
if an other than temporary decline is believed to have occurred based on our assessment of these factors  the investment is further evaluated  and if found necessary  an impairment charge is recorded 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and intangibles impairment we review our long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted and without interest charges future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets other than enterprise wide goodwill are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
if the cash flows expected to be generated by an asset were to change based on new events or changes in circumstances or if there was a decrease in the fair value of an asset to be disposed of  an impairment charge may need to be recorded 
enterprise wide goodwill is evaluated based on a comparison of our net book value to the estimated undiscounted and without interest charges future cash flows for us 
conditions that indicate that impairment of goodwill should be evaluated include a significant decrease in our market value or a current period cash flow loss combined with a history of cash flow losses 
future declines in our stock price or in market values of businesses in the media industry  as well as further declines in the overall markets could indicate that the current carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable 
this could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
lease abandonment during the third and fourth quarters of  we completed an evaluation of our real estate requirements taking into account the workforce reductions that had occurred  the completion of our new facility in san francisco  and redundant facilities elsewhere within the u 
s and internationally 
this evaluation resulted in the consolidation or abandonment of several leased facilities 
due to the decline in the commercial real estate markets in these locations  it is expected that these leased facilities will be vacant for several quarters  and once they are subleased  it will be at rates below current contractual requirements 
we recorded a charge related to the abandonment  based on the difference between the expected cash outflows and the expected cash inflows related to these vacated properties 
if there is a further decline in the commercial real estate markets  if it takes longer to sublet the facilities than expected or if these facilities when sublet are subleased at rates lower than our current estimates  the amounts we will ultimately realize could be materially different from the amounts assumed in arriving at our estimate of the costs of the lease abandonment 
deferred income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on our estimate of future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if events were to occur in the future  which are currently not contemplated in our current estimates  that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income when those events occurred 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would result in a charge to income in the period in which such determination was made 
contingencies we evaluate whether a liability must be recorded for contingencies based on whether a liability is probable and estimable 
our most significant contingencies are related to our ongoing mysimon litigation as described in item legal proceedings and our lease guarantee for office space in new york city as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
if the financial condition of any of the sublessees or the primary lessee were to deteriorate and thereby result in an inability to make their lease payments  we would be required to make additional lease payments under the guarantee 
in regards to the ongoing mysimon litigation  it is not possible to predict the amount of damages attributable to corrective advertising that could be awarded in a re trial  however such amounts  if settled adversely to us  could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations subsequent to september  and specifies criteria for recognizing intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with definite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
we will adopt sfas nos 
and effective january  we do not expect the implementation of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 we will no longer amortize our existing goodwill 
at december   goodwill approximated billion and accumulated amortization approximated billion 
goodwill amortization approximated million for the year ended december  after the adoption of sfas no 
 we will no longer amortize our existing goodwill 
in addition  as part of the transition provisions  we will be required to review for impairment all previously recognized intangible assets that have been determined to have indefinite useful lives 
we are required to complete the transition impairment tests in the first interim period after implementation 
any impairment resulting from these transition tests will be recorded as of january  and will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we will not be able to determine if an impairment will be required until completion of such impairment tests 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation 
we will adopt sfas effective january  the effect of adopting this statement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets which establishes an accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas does not apply to goodwill and other intangible assets that are not amortized 
sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events 
sfas eliminates goodwill from its scope  therefore it does not require  as sfas does  goodwill to be allocated to the long lived assets 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the effect of adopting this statement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
cautionary statement regarding factors that may affect our business  financial condition and future results our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are any statements about our future that are not statements of historical fact 
examples of forward looking statements include projections of earnings  revenues or other financial items  statements of the plans and objectives of management for future operations  statements concerning proposed new products or services  statements regarding future economic conditions or performance  and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
in some cases  you can identify these statements by the use of words such as may  will  expects  should  believes  predicts  plans  anticipates  estimates  potential  continue or the negative of these terms  or any other words of similar meaning 
these statements are only predictions 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this report and in any of our other public statements may turn out to be wrong 
they can be effected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties  some of which are outlined below under risk factors 
many factors mentioned in the discussion in this report will be important in determining future results 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual events or results may differ materially 
these forward looking statements are made only as of the date of this report  and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our q and k reports to the sec 
also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks  uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses 
these are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us 
this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of risk factors cnet networks has a limited operating history and a history of operating losses  which makes your evaluation of us difficult 
we cannot assure you that we will report net income in the future 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in developing industries  particularly companies in the relatively new and rapidly evolving market for internet products  content and services 
these risks include an evolving business model the evolving nature of the internet the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete uncertain acceptance of new services competition management of growth we cannot assure you that we will succeed in addressing these risks 
if we fail to do so  our revenues and operating results could be materially reduced 
these risks and our limited operating history make accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
we cannot assure you that our revenues will increase or continue at their current level or that we will generate positive cash flow from operations in future periods 
we have incurred significant operating losses since inception 
although we have achieved operating profitability in some reporting periods  we have experienced operating losses in subsequent periods 
for the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of billion and an accumulated deficit of billion 
we may incur additional losses in the future 
any failure to significantly increase our revenues would materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may experience fluctuations in operating results and may not be able to adjust spending in time to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
we may experience fluctuations in our revenues as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
for example  we experienced a decrease in revenue in compared to expectations because many advertisers  especially technology advertisers  who had experienced a slowdown in sales during the same period  decreased their advertising spending 
similar slowdowns may occur in the future 
other factors that may decrease revenue include decreased demand for advertising the addition or loss of advertisers  and the size and timing of the advertising purchases of individual advertisers trends in internet use and advertising  including traditional weighting of much advertising spending toward the fourth quarter competition our ability to manage effectively our development of new business segments and markets our ability to successfully manage the integration of operations and technology acquisitions and other business combinations our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure technical difficulties  system downtime  internet brownouts or denial of service or other similar attacks general economic conditions  as well as economic conditions specific to advertising  the internet and internet media disruption to our operations  employees  partners  customers and facilities caused by international or domestic terrorist attacks or armed conflict depending on the nature and timing of capital expenditures and other costs  including marketing costs  relating to our internet operations  the expansion of our operations and the introduction of new sites and services  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
due to all of the foregoing factors  any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to planned expenditures could materially reduce our operating results and materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
if our operating results fall below our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
competition is intense 
our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our prospects and financial results 
the market for internet content and services is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
it is not difficult to enter this market and current and new competitors can launch new internet sites at relatively low cost 
we derive our revenue primarily from advertising  for which we compete with various media including newspapers  radio  magazines and various internet sites that offer consumers information similar to that which we provide 
we cannot assure you that we will compete successfully with current or future competitors 
moreover  increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and profits 
if we do not compete successfully for new users and advertisers  our financial results may be materially and adversely effected 
to remain competitive  we must effectively manage our operations  including recent acquisitions 
failure to effectively manage growth could result in our inability to support and maintain our operations 
we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations through acquisitions to better position ourselves to take advantage of various potential market opportunities 
in addition  we anticipate continued expansion of our international operations and our channel initiatives as described in item business 
this rapid growth has placed  and we expect it to continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
we could experience a materially negative impact on earnings as a result of expenses associated with growing our operations  whether through internal development or through acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that our current personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations management will be able to continue to coordinate operations and employees successfully on a global level management will be able to maintain beneficial working relationships with employees  business partners and users during the coordination process management will be able to successfully identify and exploit existing and potential market opportunities if we are unable to attract new customers to our supply channel businesses  we could fail to achieve expectations for revenue growth 
our expectations for revenue growth depend in part upon growth in our businesses that do not derive revenues from advertising 
these include our channel business initiatives aimed at supplying data to and creating marketplaces for the it supply channel 
our ability to meet expectations for revenue growth may depend in part upon our ability to achieve new licenses for our data product and to obtain new customers to the channelonline service 
if we are unable to attract new customers to these channel products  we could fail to achieve our revenue growth expectations 
if technology purchasing does not increase in  there could be reduced demand for our data product and channelonline service 
our content and services may not achieve continued acceptance  which could adversely affect our profitability 
our future success depends upon our ability to deliver original and compelling content and services that attract and retain users 
we have announced that we intend to begin charging users to access certain content and services that are currently free 
the successful development and production of content and services is subject to numerous uncertainties  including the ability to anticipate and successfully respond to rapidly changing consumer tastes and preferences fund new program development attract and retain qualified editors  producers  writers  technical personnel and radio hosts we cannot assure you that our content and services will be attractive to a sufficient number of users to generate revenues consistent with our estimates or sufficient to sustain operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any new content or services will be developed in a timely or cost effective manner 
if we are unable to develop content and services that allow us to attract  retain and expand a loyal user base that is attractive to advertisers and sellers of technology products  we will be unable to generate revenue 
we depend on arrangements with third parties for internet traffic to our sites and our failure to develop and maintain relationships with third parties could adversely affect our financial condition 
we rely on the cooperation of owners and operators of other internet sites with whom we have syndication and other arrangements to generate traffic for our internet sites 
our ability to maintain these relationships will continue to be critical to the success of our internet operations 
if we are unable to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with such third parties on acceptable commercial terms  or if our competitors are better able to capitalize on these relationships  our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on advertising as a principal source of our revenue 
our financial results will be adversely affected if we fail to sustain advertising revenues or lead fees 
our revenues are derived in large part from the sale of advertising and other fees  such as lead fees  from sellers of technology products on the internet 
we expect that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from these services 
most of our advertising contracts are subject to termination by the customer at any time on thirty days prior written notice 
in addition  it may be difficult to obtain performance from advertisers who have longer term contracts 
in addition  our ability to generate advertising revenue will depend on several factors  including macroeconomic factors such as the general condition of the economy and consumer spending  which drive advertising purchases the continued development of the internet as an advertising medium the pricing of advertising on other internet sites  particularly in areas that are in high demand by advertisers the amount of traffic on our network of sites pricing pressures  delays and new product launches our ability to achieve  demonstrate and maintain attractive user demographics our ability to develop and retain a skilled advertising sales force if we do not meet these challenges  we may lose advertising customers  fail to attract new customers or be forced to reduce advertising rates in order to retain or attract customers 
accordingly  our revenues and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on  and receive  a significant percentage of our revenue from a relatively small number of large advertisers 
a relatively small number of advertisers contribute a significant percentage of our revenue 
our top one hundred advertisers contribute to or more of our us revenue 
these advertising clients may not continue to use our services to the same extent  or at all  in the future 
a significant reduction in advertising by one or more of our largest advertisers could have a material adverse effect on our profits and liquidity 
our advertising and other operating revenues may be subject to fluctuations  which could have a material adverse affect on our revenues and operating results 
we believe that advertising sales in traditional media fluctuate significantly with economic cycles and during any calendar year  with spending being weighted towards the fourth quarter 
we believe that the same trends have become more pronounced for internet advertising 
fluctuations in advertising expenditures generally  or with respect to internet based advertising specifically  could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results because advertising expenditures will account for substantially all of our revenues 
inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 
our success depends to a large extent on the continued services of shelby w 
bonnie  dan rosensweig and the other members of our senior management team 
our success is also dependent on our ability to identify  attract  retain and motivate other highly skilled officers  key employees and personnel in a very competitive job environment 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or other employees 
we may need to spend significantly more money on marketing in the future 
we cannot assure you that our present or future marketing campaigns will be effective 
to attract users and customers  we may need to spend significantly more money on marketing in the future and such additional costs could materially and adversely affect our profits 
our ability to achieve our long term operating margin targets depends on our successful deployment of common data  information  ad delivery and commerce platforms 
in order to achieve improvements in our long term operating margins  we have undertaken a significant capital project to unify the data  information  ad delivery and commerce platforms throughout our internet network 
the cost of successfully completing this project may exceed our expectation 
in addition  the new platforms may not perform as expected  which could prevent us from reaching our long term operating margin targets 
we may have difficulties with our acquisitions and investments  which could adversely affect our growth and financial condition 
from time to time  we may consider new business opportunities and ventures  including acquisitions  in a broad range of areas 
any decision by us to pursue a significant business expansion or new business opportunity would be accompanied by risks  including  among others the investment of a substantial amount of capital  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to implement our existing business strategy the issuance of additional equity interests  which would be dilutive to current stockholders the additional  substantial burdens on our management personnel and financial and operational systems the difficulty of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the possible inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel additional expenses associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets additional operating losses and expenses associated with the activities and expansion of acquired businesses the possible impairment of relationships with existing employees and advertising customers the potential undisclosed liabilities associated with acquired businesses we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any transaction or that any transaction will be profitable 
we plan to expand our international operations and may encounter a number of problems in foreign countries 
there are also a number of risks associated with international operations that could adversely affect our business 
although we have no current plans to expand into additional international markets  we plan to expand our international operations to take advantage of existing opportunities 
we have wholly owned operating subsidiaries in england  france  germany  switzerland  singapore and australia 
in addition  we have an international presence through joint venture and other partnership arrangements in china  korea and italy 
we also have license arrangements in various other countries throughout the world 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets  such as the following uncertainty of product acceptance by different cultures unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations state imposed restrictions on the repatriation of funds  particularly from china currency exchange rate fluctuations difficulties in finding appropriate foreign licensees or joint venture partners potential adverse tax consequences there is a risk that such factors will have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully operate internationally and on our profits and liquidity 
changes in regulations could adversely affect the way that we operate 
it is possible that new laws and regulations in the us and elsewhere will be adopted covering issues effecting our business  including privacy copyrights  trademarks and domain names obscene or indecent communications pricing  characteristics and quality of internet products and services the ability of children to access our services increased government regulation  or the application of existing laws to online activities  could decrease the growth of the internet reduce our revenues increase our operating expenses expose us to significant liabilities any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our profits and liquidity 
we cannot be sure what effect any future material noncompliance by us with these laws and regulations or any material changes in these laws and regulations could have on our business 
we may be subject to system disruptions  which could adversely affect our revenues 
our ability to attract and maintain relationships with users  advertisers  merchants and strategic partners will depend on the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our internet channels and network infrastructure 
our internet advertising revenues relate directly to the number of advertisements delivered to our users 
system interruptions or delays that result in the unavailability of internet channels or slower response times for users would reduce the number of advertisements and sales leads delivered to such users and reduce the attractiveness of our internet channels to users  strategic partners and advertisers or reduce the number of impressions delivered and thereby reduce revenue 
in the past twelve months  some of our smaller sub sites have experienced a small number of brief service interruptions that were a result of power outages  security breaches and other issues 
we will continue to suffer future interruptions from time to time whether due to natural disasters  telecommunications failures  other system failures  rolling blackouts  viruses  hacking or other events 
system interruptions or slower response times could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
our networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized persons accessing our systems  which could disrupt our operations and result in the theft of our proprietary information 
a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our internet operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security 
for example  so called spiders have and can be used in efforts to copy our databases  including our database of technology products and prices 
concerns over the security of internet transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet  particularly as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
our activities and the activities of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as computer software or credit card numbers 
accordingly  security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
we cannot assure you that contractual provisions attempting to limit our liability in these areas will be successful or enforceable  or that other parties will accept such contractual provisions as part of our agreements 
our business involves risks of liability claims for internet  print and radio content or technology  which could result in significant costs 
as a publisher and a distributor of content through the internet  radio and print publications  we may face potential liability for defamation negligence copyright  patent or trademark infringement other claims based on the nature and content of the materials published or distributed these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services and publishers of print publications and radio content 
in addition  we could be exposed to liability in connection with material indexed or offered on our internet sites or for information collected from and about our users 
there has been a recent increase in the granting and attempted enforcement of business process patents that cover practices that may be widely employed in the internet industry 
if we are found to violate any such patent  and we are unable to enter into a license agreement on reasonable terms  our ability to offer services could be materially and adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that third parties or users will not bring claims against us relating to proprietary rights or use of personal information 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of defamation  negligence and similar claims  and it may or may not apply to a particular claim or be adequate to reimburse us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
for example  our download 
com directory includes listings for music sharing software that may be subject to challenge under copyright laws 
although we do not believe that our listing of any such software should expose us to liability  it is possible that such a claim may be successfully brought 
our financial condition may be impacted by certain contingencies 
as further described in item legal proceedings  we are a party to a trademark infringement suit filed against mysimon  inc  a subsidiary of cnet 
there is a possibility that we may be liable for damages as a result of this lawsuit  however  the extent of potential damages is unknown 
while we believe that our losses will be covered by insurance  our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted by a loss or an adverse settlement 
in addition  in conjunction with the zdnet acquisition  we assumed guarantee of the obligations of ziff davis media inc under a new york city office lease for a total of  square feet 
in connection with that guarantee  we also have a letter of credit for million outstanding as a security deposit 
this lease expires in the average cost per square foot is approximately thirty dollars over the term of the lease 
we currently occupy  square feet of the office space covered under this lease 
ziff davis media inc currently occupies  square feet of this space 
there are two additional sublessees  the bank of new york and softbank  who collectively occupy a total of  square feet 
as of december   the total minimum lease payments remaining until the end of the lease term were million  excluding the amounts attributable to our sublease 
if the financial condition of any of the sublessees or the primary lessee were to deteriorate and thereby result in an inability to make their lease payments  we would be required to make additional lease payments under the guarantee  which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our financial condition 
our debt outstanding at december  was approximately million 
we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt as described below make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions or general corporate purposes limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business reduce funds available for use in our operations impair our ability to incur additional debt because of financial and other restrictive covenants make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or an increase in interest rates if we experience a decline in revenues due to any of the factors described in this risk factors section or otherwise  we could have difficulty paying interest and other amounts due on our indebtedness 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments  or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness  we would be in default  which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under our other indebtedness 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuation 
the trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations  which are a result of a number of events and factors  including quarterly variations in operating results announcements of innovations requiring significant expenditures new products  strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors changes in our financial estimates or that of securities analysts changes in recommendations of securities analysts the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us news reports  including those relating to trends in the internet other events or factors in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
these fluctuations may make it more difficult to use stock as currency to make acquisitions that might otherwise be advantageous  or to use stock options as a means to attract and retain employees 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings compared to our or analysts or investors expectations could cause  and has in the past caused an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock 
we have a substantial number of shares of common stock that may be sold  which could affect the trading price of our common stock 
we have a substantial number of shares of common stock subject to stock options  and our notes may be converted into shares of our common stock 
in addition  as of december   we have over million shares of authorized but unissued shares of our common stock that are available for future sale 
as of december   we also had options outstanding to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock and notes outstanding that were convertible into approximately  shares of our common stock 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of our common stock or notes  or the availability of shares of our common stock or notes for future sale  will have on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  softbank  which owns approximately of our outstanding common stock  has a right  pursuant to registration rights granted under the stockholder agreement  to require us to register for public sale our common stock owned by softbank 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued in connection with acquisitions  upon the exercise of stock options or warrants or the conversion of debt securities  or the perception that such sales could occur  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay  prevent or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  proxy contest or change of control 
our stockholders might view any transaction of this type as being in their best interest since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock 
among other things  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock with the terms of each series to be fixed by our board of directors divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year permit directors to be removed only for cause specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations in addition  with some exceptions  the delaware general corporation law restricts or delays mergers and other business combinations between us and any stockholder that acquires or more of our voting stock 
ownership of our common stock will be concentrated in a small group of stockholders whose interests may differ from those of other stockholders 
softbank and shelby w 
bonnie  the chairman and chief executive officer of cnet  together control approximately of our outstanding common stock 
the concentration of ownership of our common stock may delay  prevent or deter a change in control  could deprive other stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of cnet or its assets and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
also  these stockholders can exert significant control over actions requiring the approval of a majority of the voting stock  including amendments to our charter 
commercial and other transactions between us  on the one hand  and the directors  officers and major stockholders of cnet and their affiliates  on the other  create potential for  or could result in  conflicting interests 
changes to accounting rules regarding goodwill could make our reported results less predictable in july  the financial accounting standards board changed accounting rules regarding the accounting for goodwill 
changes to these rules may have a significant impact on our reported financial results 
the new fasb standards relating to accounting for goodwill could make our acquisition related charges less predictable in any given reporting period 
statement of accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets establishes a new standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination 
it continues to require recognition of goodwill as an asset but does not permit amortization of goodwill as was required by accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets 
under the new statement  goodwill will be separately tested for impairment using a fair value based approach when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
the change from an amortization approach to an impairment approach will apply to previously recorded goodwill  as well as goodwill arising from acquisitions completed after the application of the new standard 
upon adoption  our goodwill amortization charges will cease 
however  it is possible that in the future  we would incur less frequent  but larger  impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded as well as any goodwill arising out of future acquisitions 
accordingly  our future earnings may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a period to period basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held  information technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method  as we do not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investee or their operations 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired
