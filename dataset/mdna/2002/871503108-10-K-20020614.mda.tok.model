revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from sales of packaged software products  perpetual software license agreements  product maintenance and professional services  and recognize this revenue in accordance with statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  when the following conditions have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  passage of title occurs  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  if applicable  customer acceptance has been received  collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is considered reasonably assured  and if appropriate  reasonable estimates of future product returns have been made 
we sell packaged products through a multi tiered distribution channel 
we defer revenue on all distribution and reseller channel inventory in excess of specified inventory levels in these channels 
we offer the right of return of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors  resellers and end user customers 
we estimate and record reserves for end user product returns and channel and end user rebates  and we account for these reserves as an offset to revenue 
we enter into perpetual software license agreements through direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors and resellers 
the license agreements generally include product maintenance agreements  for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the agreements 
our professional services include consulting  education  and managed security services 
we recognize consulting services revenue as services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers  if 
table of contents applicable 
we recognize education services revenue as services are performed 
we recognize managed security services revenue ratably over the period that such contracted services are provided 
in arrangements that include software licenses and maintenance and or professional services  and packaged products with content updates multiple elements  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
if vsoe does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance or professional services  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized over the performance period 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income and net income loss  as well as on the value of certain assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
see summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page in the consolidated financial statements for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies 
we have engaged in discussions with our audit committee of the board of directors regarding the development  selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies 
channel revenue deferrals we defer revenue relating to products  primarily in our consumer and enterprise administration segments  that we have shipped into our distribution and reseller channels to the extent that such shipments result in there being inventory in excess of certain specified inventory levels for these channels 
we defer this revenue as an offset to accounts receivable 
we estimate the excess of inventory levels in these channels by analyzing channel inventory level and distribution sell through trends obtained from our channel partners  as well as various historical trends on a product basis 
in addition  we consider other factors in assessing these specified inventory levels  such as product seasonality  current market conditions  economic trends  existing security threats and timing of new product releases 
on the same basis  we estimate the associated cost of revenues related to the channel revenue deferral 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented 
reserves for product returns end users may return our products  primarily within our enterprise administration and consumer segments  through distributors and resellers or to us directly for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
our estimated reserves for such end user product returns are based primarily on historical trends 
product returns by distributors and resellers principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products 
our return policy allows distributors and resellers  subject to certain contractual limitations  to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases 
channel revenue deferrals  as discussed above  are designed to take into account any distributor and reseller stock balancing returns 
in addition  we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels 
we also consider other factors such as the timing of upgrades and new versions of products  current market conditions  economic trends and changes in technology 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 

table of contents reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates  related primarily to products within our enterprise security  enterprise administration and consumer segments 
our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs  which are typically entered into quarterly 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated on the terms and conditions of the promotional program  actual sales during the promotion  amount of actual redemptions received  historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate 
we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserve for rebates 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential uncollectible trade receivables 
we review our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues 
we exercise judgment when determining the adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt trends  general economic conditions in the us and internationally  and changes in customer financial conditions 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences may result in additional reserves for trade receivables  which would be reflected by charges in general and administrative expenses for any period presented 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including property  equipment  leasehold improvements  acquired product rights and goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the assets carrying amount 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences may result in write downs of net long lived assets  which would be reflected by charges to our operating results for any period presented 
effective april   impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets will be assessed according to new accounting guidelines see recent accounting pronouncements below 
restructuring and site closures during fiscal  we incurred expenses related to consolidating  moving and relocating various groups or sites 
in determining the charge related to our excess facilities  certain estimates were used  such as potential ability to sublease and sublease terms upon the negotiation of future subleases  broker commissions  costs of tenant improvements and related exit costs 
in developing our estimates  we obtained information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a sub leasee 
market conditions will affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates 
our ability to sublease facilities ahead of schedule or the negotiation of lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated will affect our accrual and the related charge for restructuring  site closures and other expenses 
difference between estimates of related broker commissions  tenant improvements and related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation 
if we employed different assumptions regarding these various components of our exit costs  the costs recorded for any period presented could vary materially from those actually recorded 

table of contents deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we will establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future us taxable income and future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions  as well as our implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
recent significant acquisitions and divestitures in august  we divested our web access management product line  which we acquired in our acquisition of axent  to passgo technologies ltd 
for approximately million 
we also entered into an exclusive license and option agreement with passgo whereby they will license our web access management technology products 
in consideration for the license  passgo is required to pay us quarterly royalties based on their net revenue over a four year period 
passgo also has an option to purchase this technology at a price starting at million and declining to million over a four year period 
in december  we acquired of the outstanding common stock of axent  an enterprise security software company  in exchange for symantec common stock 
we also assumed all of the outstanding axent employee stock options 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and was initially recorded for approximately million  which included goodwill of million  tangible and intangible assets of million  in process research and development of million  deferred compensation of  offset by million in deferred income taxes 
during the december quarter  we recorded additional deferred tax assets of million attributable to carryforward tax benefits  with a corresponding offset to goodwill 
during the june quarter  we increased the purchase price and goodwill by million  as we resolved certain pre acquisition contingencies 
effective april   the related net balance of goodwill and workforce in place for the axent acquisitions and other acquisitions completed prior to july  will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to an annual impairment test

net revenues net revenues increased to approximately billion during fiscal from million during fiscal net revenues increased to approximately million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased sales of our enterprise security products and a significant increase in sales of our consumer products during the second half of fiscal the increase in enterprise security products during fiscal was attributable to a full year of sales related to axent solutions as compared to approximately three months during fiscal from a regional standpoint  this increase was primarily due to growth in net revenues in the united states and to a lesser extent in europe 
the increase during fiscal as compared to fiscal was largely due to sales of our enterprise security products  including introductions of new products and increased sales outside of the united states 

table of contents the increase in enterprise security products during fiscal was attributable to approximately three months of sales related to axent solutions  as a result of our acquisition of axent in december segments enterprise security our enterprise security segment revenue comprised approximately  and of total net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
net revenues increased million  or  to approximately million during fiscal from million during fiscal and increased million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase during fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to our first full year of sales of intrusion detection  vulnerability management and firewall product solutions  as a result of our acquisition of axent in december  and in particular  significant growth in sales of virus protection product solutions 
enterprise administration our enterprise administration segment represented approximately  and of total net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
net revenues decreased by approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a decline in sales of our pcanywhere product  partially offset by growth in sales of our ghost corporate edition product 
the decline in our pcanywhere product was the result of a decrease in small business and home office sales  which was partially offset by an increase in corporate sales 
net revenues increased by approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the release of our ghost corporate edition product 
consumer products our consumer products segment represented approximately  and of total net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
net revenues increased by approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily related to an increase in sales of our norton antivirus and norton internet security products  mostly as a result of strong consumer and small business spending  and an increase in the renewal subscription pricing of our antivirus products 
this increase was offset by a decline in sales of our winfax and macintosh products 
in particular  we experienced a significant increase in sales of consumer products over the second half of fiscal  and we do not expect sales to continue to grow at the same rate going forward 
over the last six years  our sales to individual consumers  home offices and small businesses have been seasonal  with higher sales generally in our december and march quarters 
net revenues increased by approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increase in customer focus on protecting their home computers from internet related attacks 
this factor contributed to growth in sales of our norton internet security product  which was introduced in the march quarter 
services and other our services and other segments represented approximately  and of total net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
net revenues increased in absolute dollars during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due primarily to our services segment as the demand for our consulting services increased 
net revenues decreased in absolute dollars during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to our divestiture of the visual caf and act product lines in december  which is included in the other segment 

table of contents international net revenues outside of the united states represented approximately  and of total net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
international net revenues increased by million  or  to approximately million during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase in net revenues was the result of increased sales in europe and asia  primarily from increased sales of our enterprise security and consumer products 
international revenues increased by million  or  to approximately million during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was largely due to stronger sales in europe and japan 
weakness in international currencies during fiscal negatively impacted our international revenue growth by approximately million as compared to the impact of average international currency rates during fiscal the negative impact during fiscal as compared to the impact of average international currency rates during fiscal was approximately million 
product returns we estimate and record channel deferrals and obsolescence reserves to cover exposures related to product returns 
product returns principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products  which are offset by orders of equal or greater value for the current versions of the products 
the mix of products returned from our distributors resellers as compared to products sold to our distributors resellers does not impact our gross margin  as our gross margin is materially consistent across our various product families 
changes in the level of product returns and related product returns provision are generally offset by a change in the level of gross revenue 
as a result  the product returns provision did not have a material impact on reported net revenues in any period presented 
gross margin gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing expenses  costs for producing manuals and cds  packaging costs  royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts  costs of consulting services  technical support costs and amortization and write off of acquired product rights 
gross margin was approximately  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
the decline in gross margin during fiscal as compared to fiscal was mostly driven by increased amortization of acquired product rights from our acquisition of axent and technical support costs as a result of an increase in related enterprise sales 
in addition  consulting service costs included in costs of revenue increased along with the related increase in consulting service revenues 
this contributed to the decline in gross margin during fiscal  as consulting services typically have lower margins than our products 
gross margin improved slightly during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to higher margins associated with the increase in enterprise related sales and cost savings achieved in reduced packaging costs 
acquired product rights acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product rights  technologies and workforce in place 
during fiscal  we recorded approximately million in acquired product rights in connection with our acquisition of axent  and during fiscal  we recorded approximately million in acquired product rights in connection with other acquisitions 
during fiscal  amortization of acquired product rights totaled approximately million  of which million and million was recorded in cost of revenues and income net of expense from sale of technologies and product lines  respectively 
during fiscal and  amortization of acquired product rights totaled million and million  respectively  and was recorded in cost of revenues 
acquired product rights  with the exception of workforce in place  will be amortized over the next four years 
effective 
table of contents april   the net balance of workforce in place of approximately million  net of a deferred tax liability  will be included with goodwill and will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test 
for further discussion on acquired product rights and related amortization  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
research and development expenses we charge research and development expenditures to operations as incurred 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses remained flat at during fiscal  and although research and development expenses remained flat as a percentage of net revenues  absolute dollars increased to approximately million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase was primarily a result of salary increases and other employee related expenses  infrastructure related expenditures and a full year of axent related research and development expenses as compared to approximately three months during fiscal research and development expenses increased to approximately million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase was a result of enterprise security segment hiring  salary increases and other employee related expenses and axent related research and development expenses that were included from the date of acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by the lack of expenses during fiscal associated with the divested visual caf and act product lines and the patent claim settlements in the consumer products segment 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were during fiscal and were flat at during fiscal and sales and marketing expenses were approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily related to enterprise security segment hiring  salary and commission increases  outside services for consultants and contractors  infrastructure related expenditures  and a full year of axent related sales and marketing expenses as compared to approximately three months during fiscal the absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal was also due to increased enterprise security segment hiring  increase in salaries  commissions and other performance based compensation  and axent related sales and marketing expenses which were included from the date of acquisition 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained flat at during fiscal and and were during fiscal general and administrative expenses were approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a full year of axent related general and administrative expenses as compared to approximately three months during fiscal  salary increases  legal fees  infrastructure related expenditures and bad debt expense  offset by a reduction of other general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in salary related expenses and other general and administrative expenses  offset by a reduction in bad debt expenses 

table of contents amortization of goodwill and other intangibles from acquisitions amortization of goodwill and other intangibles from acquisitions increased to approximately million during fiscal from million during fiscal  and increased to approximately million during fiscal from million during fiscal these increases were related primarily to the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquisition of axent in december effective april   the net balance of goodwill of approximately million will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test 
as a result  amortization charges will decrease significantly going forward  however  our operating results may be subject to increased volatility as a result of periodic goodwill impairment charges 
other intangibles from acquisitions will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
acquired in process research and development expenses we recorded no acquired in process research and development charges during fiscal during fiscal  we acquired axent and during fiscal  we acquired urlabs and l network security s operations 
we wrote off approximately million and million of acquired in process research and development associated with these acquisitions during fiscal and  respectively 
these write offs were necessary because the acquired technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and there were no alternative uses 
the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology principally related to the completion of all planning  design  development and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design specifications including features  functions and performance 
we expect the acquired in process technology to be developed into commercially feasible products 
however  there are no assurances that this will occur 
if we fail to complete these products in their entirety  or in a timely manner  we may not continue to attract new users  we may be unable to retain our existing users and the value of the other intangible assets may become impaired 
we determined the fair value of the acquired in process technology for each of the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects  including the cost to complete the acquired in process technologies and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
we discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values 
we based the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects 
a valuation specialist used our estimates to establish the amount of acquired in process research and development to be written off for these acquisitions during fiscal and actual spending on these product development projects since our acquisition of the companies discussed below did not differ materially from the original assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings 
axent the in process technology acquired in the axent acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of esm  intruder alert  raptor firewall  webthority and other projects 
axent s research and development was focused on providing more robust features in its development of these next generation products 
we have added these projects to our product offerings  with the exception of webthority  which was divested with our web access management product line in august l network security the in process technology acquired in the l network security purchase consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of retriever and expert 
we have integrated this technology into our vulnerability management products 

table of contents urlabs the in process technology acquired in the urlabs purchase consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of urlabs two main products  i gear and mail gear  which have been added to our product offerings 
restructuring  site closures and other expenses restructuring  site closures and other expenses were approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we incurred expenses related to consolidating smaller sites into a larger facility in newport news  virginia  consolidating most of our united kingdom facilities to maidenhead  uk  consolidating our european support functions by moving our leiden  netherlands facility to dublin  ireland and relocating our north american support group to springfield  oregon 
as a result  we recorded approximately million for exit costs  including million in rent and related exit costs remaining on the abandoned facilities and million in related abandoned fixed asset and leasehold improvement write offs 
in addition  we recorded approximately million for costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services  as we reorganized various operating functions  including former axent operations  and reduced our workforce by employees 
during the june quarter  we will record costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services  as a result of the relocation of our leiden  netherlands operations to dublin  ireland 
during fiscal  we reorganized various operating functions  including a portion of our operations in toronto 
we reduced our workforce by employees and ten members of our senior management  and as a result  we recorded approximately million for costs of severance  related benefits  outplacement services and abandonment of certain equipment 
during fiscal  we reduced our operations and realigned our business units  including operations in melville and toronto and our internet tools business unit 
we reduced our workforce by employees and five members of our senior management  and as a result  we recorded approximately million for severance  related benefits  outplacement services and abandonment of certain facilities and equipment

interest income  interest expense and other income expense interest income was approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
although interest income was relatively flat during fiscal and fiscal  average cash balances were higher during fiscal as compared to fiscal  which was offset by a decrease in average interest rates 
interest income increased significantly during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher average cash balances during fiscal interest expense was approximately million during fiscal  nearly all of which was related to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated debentures in october interest expense was not significant during fiscal and other expense  net of approximately  during fiscal was primarily comprised of net losses from non functional currency transactions

table of contents approximately million during fiscal and was primarily comprised of net gains from non functional currency transactions 
income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines was approximately million  million  and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal and  income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines was related primarily to royalties from interact commerce corporation  who subsequently merged with the sage group plc  as a result of the divestiture of our act product line in december income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines during fiscal related primarily to gains of million and million on the divestiture of our visual caf and act product lines  respectively  in december in addition  income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines during fiscal included million related to payments from jetform corporation  associated with our sale of certain software products  technologies and tangible assets to jetform during fiscal  and million related to royalties from interact 
income taxes our effective tax rate on income before one time charges acquired in process research and development  restructuring  site closures and other expenses  goodwill amortization expense and gain on sale of product lines was during fiscal  and our fiscal  and effective rates were lower than the us federal and state combined statutory rate primarily due to a lower statutory tax rate on income generated by our irish operations 
our effective tax rate on income before taxes was  and during fiscal  and  respectively 
the higher effective tax rate during fiscal and reflects the non deductibility of acquired in process research and development and substantially all of the goodwill amortization 
in addition  during fiscal  tax was provided on the gain on sale of product lines at an effective tax rate of 
this rate is lower than the us federal and state combined statutory rate because a portion of the gain is attributable to our irish operations and accordingly subject to a lower irish tax rate 
realization of approximately million of our net deferred tax asset as of march  is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income of million 
realization of the remaining million of our net deferred tax asset as of march  is dependent in part on future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions and on our implementation of tax planning strategies 
we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected levels of future taxable income as well as the implementation of tax planning strategies 
levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in the business risk factors set forth in this item additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we will assess the need for additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
we project our effective tax rate to be for fiscal as a result of the discontinuation of goodwill amortization see recent accounting pronouncements for further discussion 
this projection  however  is subject to change due to potential tax law changes and fluctuations in the geographic allocation of earnings 
selected pro forma financial data for comparative purposes  the following table displays  on a pro forma basis  our results of operations as if the acquisition of axent had occurred at the beginning of fiscal and excluding all acquisition related amortization and one time charges and the operating results of the divested visual caf and act product

during fiscal  shares used to compute pro forma net income per share diluted include approximately million shares issuable from assumed exercise of options and million shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures issued in october correspondingly  the numerator used to compute pro forma net income diluted during fiscal excludes the interest expense of approximately million from the convertible subordinated debentures  net of income tax 
during fiscal and  shares used to compute pro forma net income per share diluted include approximately million and million shares  respectively  which represents the number of symantec shares that would have been exchanged for axent s weighted number of common shares outstanding for the respective periods 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million to approximately billion at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal this increase was largely due to the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated debentures of approximately million and from cash provided from operations of million  as well as net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
the cash provided by these factors was partially offset by cash paid to purchase marketable securities and investments  net of proceeds  of approximately million  and to a lesser extent cash paid to repurchase common stock and capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million and was comprised of net non cash related expenses of million and a net increase of million in liabilities  net of a decrease in assets  offset by a net loss of approximately million 
net trade accounts receivable decreased million to approximately million as of march  from million as of march  the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to net 
table of contents revenues being generated more evenly throughout the march quarter due primarily to the increase in sales of consumer products  which resulted in higher cash collections 
in prior quarters  we had generated a larger percentage of net revenues during the last month of each quarter 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and was comprised primarily of million in net purchases of marketable securities and investments  and million of capital expenditures  including million for the implementation of oracle i and a crm system and million in january and million in november for land and a building in maidenhead  united kingdom and dublin  ireland  respectively 
on january   the board of directors replaced an earlier stock repurchase program with a new authorization to repurchase up to million  not to exceed million shares  of symantec s common stock with no expiration date 
during the september quarter  we repurchased million shares at prices ranging from to per share  for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
during the march quarter  we repurchased million shares at prices ranging from to per share  for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
on october   we completed a private offering of million of convertible subordinated debentures due november   the net proceeds of which were approximately million 
the debentures are convertible into shares of symantec s common stock by the holders at any time before maturity at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
we may redeem the notes on or after november   at a redemption price of of stated principal during the period november  through october  and thereafter

we believe that existing cash and short term investments  cash generated from operating results and cash from the subordinated convertible debenture offering will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next year 
synthetic leases we currently have two real estate leasing arrangements that we have classified as operating leases 
one of the lease arrangements is for two existing office buildings in cupertino  california 
lease payments for these facilities are based on the three month libor in effect at the beginning of each fiscal quarter plus a specified margin

we have the right to acquire the related properties at any time during the six and one half year lease period ending september  we moved into the oregon facility immediately after the end of the december quarter and into the virginia facility in april if  at the end of the lease term we do not renew the lease  purchase the properties or arrange for a third party to purchase the properties  we may be obligated to the lessor for all or some portion of an amount up to the guaranteed residual amount representing approximately of the lessor s ultimate purchase price of the properties  up to a maximum amount of approximately million as of march  as security for each of these arrangements  we are required to maintain a cash collateral balance  which was approximately million as of march  we are required to invest the cash collateral in us treasury securities or certificates of deposit with specified lenders and maturities not to exceed two to three years 
in accordance with the lease terms  these funds are not available to meet operating cash requirements 
as of march   the investments related to the california lease totaled approximately million and the investments related to the oregon and virginia leases totaled million 
these amounts were classified as non current restricted investments within the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we are obligated to maintain certain financial covenants including a minimum cash balance  tangible net worth and quarterly earnings before income tax  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  and maximum debt and senior debt to ebitda ratios 
future acquisitions  financing activities or operating losses may cause us to be in violation of these financial covenants 
in the event of default  we may be required to release the cash collateral and take possession of the buildings 
as of march   we were in compliance with all of the above financial covenants 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test 
other intangibles will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will adopt sfas no 
in our first quarter of fiscal upon adoption of sfas no 
 we will stop the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives with a net carrying value of approximately million  net of a deferred tax liability  as of march  as a result of the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill existing as of march  and excluding the impact of potential impairment charges  the application of sfas no 
is expected to result in an increase in our results of operations of approximately million during fiscal during the first six months of fiscal  we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives as of april   using the two step process required under sfas we have not yet determined what effect these tests will have on our earnings and financial position 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
we will adopt this statement on april  adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the lessors associated with lease agreements relating to certain of our facilities  described under synthetic leases above  are special purpose entities or equivalent structures 
presently  we account for these leases as operating leases  while the special purpose entities or equivalent structures own and account for the leased assets and related liabilities in their records 
the fasb has indicated that it will  prior to june   issue proposed new rules on accounting for entities that lack sufficient independent economic substance  including special purpose entities  in the form of an interpretation to sfas no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  and accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 

table of contents based on public comments from the fasb to date  the proposed interpretation will provide guidance for determining when an entity such as us  the primary beneficiary  should consolidate another entity  a special purpose entity or equivalent structure such as the lessor  that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
the expected proposed interpretation may result in us having to consolidate the operating results of the special purpose entities and equivalent structures  which are the lessors under the aforementioned operating lease agreements 
the effective date of these proposed new rules on our current operating leases could be as early as the beginning of our fiscal year  and sooner on any new leases entered into after the new rules effective date which utilize special purpose entities or equivalent structures 
business risk factors there is uncertainty as to whether or not we will be able to sustain the growth rates in sales of our products  particularly in consumer antivirus protection products 
during the second half of fiscal  we experienced a higher than expected rate of growth in sales of our consumer antivirus protection products  and we may not be able to sustain this high growth rate on a consistent basis going forward 
we believe that consumer antivirus sales were spurred by a number of factors  including outbreaks of the well publicized code red and nimda viruses and a reaction from the september terrorist attacks 
in addition  although the release of new operating systems incorporating security and virus protection features  particularly past releases of microsoft windows  have increased competition in our market and had a harmful effect on demand  the recent release of windows xp may have actually spurred additional sales 
these positive factors are likely to weaken over time  and it is possible that growth rates in sales of antivirus protection products may decline 
these factors may have also had a short term effect on growth in enterprise security products  and we note that sales of our enterprise security products decreased from the third to the fourth quarter of fiscal if sales of these products decline faster than expected  our stock price may be harmed 
we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions  which give rise to a number of risks that could have adverse consequences for our future operating results 
we have made six acquisitions since march  with our acquisition of axent technologies  inc in december being the largest 
although we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing them  we will likely pursue future acquisitions 
integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
our past acquisitions have given rise to substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets that have been amortized or written off in subsequent years 
future acquisitions may result in substantial amounts of goodwill that will be subject to an annual impairment test and other intangible assets that will be amortized  subject to an annual impairment test or written off 
in addition  a number of our acquisitions have resulted in substantial restructuring and other related expenses and write offs of acquired in process research and development costs  and this also may occur as a result of future acquisitions 
further  we may need to issue equity or incur additional debt to finance future acquisitions  which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or could increase our leverage 
any of these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or to realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition 
further  the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management focus from other opportunities and challenges  and increase our expenses and working capital requirements 
demand for our products is subject to seasonal trends 
although there is no assurance this trend will continue  our sales of consumer products over the last six years have been seasonal  with higher sales generally in our december and march quarters 
in addition  we anticipate that sales of enterprise security products may be higher in the march quarter in the future  as our sales force attempts to close transactions before the end of our fiscal year 
to the extent seasonality makes it more difficult to predict our revenues and value our business  our stock price may suffer and the volatility of our stock may increase 
our increased sales of enterprise wide site licenses may increase fluctuations in our financial results 
sales of enterprise wide site licenses through our enterprise security segment have been increasing and now represent a major portion of our business 
this enterprise market has significantly different characteristics than the consumer market and different skills and resources are needed to penetrate this market 
as our enterprise 
table of contents segment becomes more important to our business and our product strategy continues to develop  we may face new competitors or new levels of competition 
enterprise licensing arrangements involve a longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels  require greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship and can sometimes result in lower operating margins 
the timing of the execution of volume licenses  or their nonrenewal or renegotiation by large customers  could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
economic and political conditions and conditions affecting the network security market in particular may have a negative impact on our revenues and margins 
the market for our products depends on economic conditions affecting the broader network security  internet infrastructure and related markets 
more generally  the slowdown in the us economy may hurt consumer demand for our services 
on the enterprise side  the continued slowdown in corporate earnings and tightening of corporate budgets may cause potential customers to delay or cancel security projects  reduce their overall or security specific information technology budgets  or reduce or cancel orders for our products 
further  in this environment  customers may experience financial difficulty  cease operations or fail to budget for the purchase of our products 
this  in turn  may lead to longer sales cycles  delays in payment and collection  and price pressures  causing us to realize lower revenues and margins 
in addition  the terrorist acts of september  created an uncertain economic and political environment in many parts of the world  and we cannot predict the impact of these events  or of any related military action  on our customers or business 
piracy of our software may have a significant impact on our net revenues 
while we are unable to determine the exact extent of piracy of our software products  software piracy may depress our net revenues 
while this would adversely affect domestic revenue  revenue loss is believed to be even more significant outside of the united states  particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 
we engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected and we cooperate with the business software alliance in their efforts to combat piracy 
however  such continued efforts may not be successful in preventing piracy of our products from occurring 
we are in the process of making substantial changes to our information systems that could disrupt our business 
the information systems that supported our accounting  finance  order management and manufacturing systems were based on oracle  and many of the business applications used in other aspects of our business have been tightly coupled with oracle oracle has released a new version  i  and has announced that support for oracle will be discontinued after june in addition  as our business has grown  we have developed needs for an increasingly robust customer relationship management  or crm  system 
during fiscal  we began implementing oracle i and a new crm system 
oracle i implementation occurred in the december quarter for the united states operations and should be completed by the june quarter for the europe  middle east and africa operations 
the first two phases of the crm implementation occurred in june and february  with the remaining implementation phases scheduled for the first and third quarters of fiscal these types of transitions frequently prove disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate 
failure to manage a smooth transition to the new systems and the ongoing operations and support of the new systems could materially harm our business operations 

table of contents our markets are competitive and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition 
our markets are competitive 
if we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition  our operating results could be adversely affected by reducing our sales or the prices we can charge for our products 
in the recent past  many of our competitors have significantly lowered the price of their products and we may have to do the same to remain competitive 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our products or develop new products that are compatible with new hardware and operating systems 
we have no control over  and limited insight into  development efforts by third parties with respect to new hardware and operating systems and we may not respond effectively or timely to such changes in the market 
in addition  we have limited resources and we must make strategic decisions as to the best allocation of our resources to position ourselves for changes in our markets 
we may from time to time allocate resources to projects or markets that do not develop as rapidly or fully as we expect 
we may fail to allocate resources to third party products  to markets or to business models that are more successful than we anticipate 
our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our products  we expect to be an ongoing target of such disruptions 
similarly  experienced computer programmers  or hackers  may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
our activities could be substantially disrupted and our reputation  and future sales  harmed if these efforts are successful 
we face risks associated with our foreign operations 
a significant portion of our net revenues  manufacturing costs and operating expenses result from transactions outside of the united states  often in foreign currencies 
as a result  our future operating results could be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and general uncertainty with each country s political and economic structure 
in addition  governmental regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain any required export approval of our technologies  particularly our encryption technologies  could impede our international sales 
in light of recent terrorist activity  governments could enact additional regulation or restrictions on the use  import or export of encryption technologies 
additional regulation of encryption technology could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications 
this might decrease demand for our products and services 
introduction of new operating systems may adversely affect our financial results and stock price 
the inclusion of security  remote access or virus protection tools in new operating systems and hardware packages could adversely affect our sales 
for example  the inclusion of features by microsoft in future editions of windows which directly compete with our products may decrease or delay the demand for certain of our products  including those currently under development 
additionally  as hardware vendors incorporate additional server based network management and security tools into network operating systems  the demand may decrease for some of our products  including those currently under development 
our earnings and stock price are subject to significant fluctuations 
due to many factors  including those noted in this section  our earnings and stock price have been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility 
there have been previous quarters in which we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
this may occur again in the future 
any such volatility may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock 

table of contents fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have affected our stock price in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors  the trading price of shares of our common stock and of the debentures could be negatively affected 
our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and may vary substantially in the future depending upon a number of factors  including the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of our products and product upgrades  the introduction of competitive products  uncertainty about and customer confidence in the current economic conditions and outlook  reduced demand for any given product  seasonality in the end of period buying patterns of foreign and domestic software customers  and the market s transition between new releases of operating systems 
in addition to the foregoing factors  the risk of quarterly fluctuations is increased by the fact that a significant portion of our net revenues has historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter 
most resellers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter 
in addition  many enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter 
in part  this is because these two groups are able  or believe that they are able  to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms at that time 
our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues 
due to this end of period buying pattern  forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us 
in addition  these factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and analysts 
we must effectively adapt to changes in the dynamic technological environment 
we are increasingly focused on the internet security market  which  in turn is dependent on further acceptance and increased use of the internet 
the following critical issues concerning the use of the internet remain unresolved and may affect the market for our products and the use of the internet as a medium to distribute or support our software products and the functionality of some of our products security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service  and potential tax or other government regulations 
in addition  new technologies  such as non pc based internet access devices and handheld organizers are gaining acceptance 
we must adapt to these changing technological demands 
if we are unable to timely assimilate changes brought about by the internet and non pc based environments  our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
the results of our research and development efforts are uncertain 
we will need to incur significant research and development expenditures in future periods as we strive to remain competitive 
the length of our product development cycle has generally been greater than we originally expected and we are likely to experience delays in future product development 
in addition  a portion of our development efforts have not been technologically successful and certain products have not achieved market acceptance 
as a result  the 
table of contents products we are currently developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful  achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with products of our competitors 
we are dependent upon certain distribution channels 
a large portion of our sales is made through the retail distribution channel  which is subject to events that cause unpredictability in consumer demand 
this increases the risk that we may not plan effectively for the future  which could result in adverse operating results in future periods 
our retail distribution customers also carry our competitors products 
these retail distributors may have limited capital to invest in inventory 
their decisions to purchase our products are partly a function of pricing  terms and special promotions offered by our competitors and other factors that we do not control and cannot predict 
our agreements with retail distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by them or by us without cause 
we would be adversely affected if companies in our chain of distributors chose to increase purchases from our competition relative to the amount they purchase from us 
some distributors and resellers have experienced financial difficulties in the past 
distributors that account for a significant portion of our sales may experience financial difficulties in the future 
if these distributors do experience financial difficulties and we are unable to move their inventories to other distributors  we may experience reduced sales or increased write offs  which would adversely affect our operating results 
product returns may negatively affect our net revenues 
product returns can occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors or retailers have excess inventories  subject to various contractual limitations 
our return policy allows distributors  subject to these contractual limitations  to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases 
end users may return our products through dealers and distributors or to us directly for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
future returns could exceed the reserves we have established for product returns  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we depend on internal communications systems that may be disrupted 
our order management and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed 
a business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the interruption in service by communications carriers 
if our communications between these centers are disrupted  particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter  we may suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a resulting adverse impact on our operating results 
communications and internet connectivity disruptions may also cause delays in customer access to our internet based services or product sales 
we are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our financial results 
from time to time  we may be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  or other product liability claims  or other claims incidental to our business 
we are currently involved in a number of lawsuits 
we intend to defend all of these lawsuits vigorously 
however  it is possible that we could suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions of these lawsuits  our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit  they are expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from day to day operations 
if a third party alleges that we have infringed their intellectual property rights  we may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license from the third party 
if we engage in litigation and the third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is not available on reasonable terms  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
the trend toward consolidation in the software industry could impede our ability to compete effectively 
consolidation is underway among companies in the software industry as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of software products and broader arrays of software solutions 
changes resulting from this consolidation may negatively impact our competitive condition 
in addition  to the extent that we seek to expand our product lines and skills and capacity through acquisitions  the trend toward consolidation may result in our encountering competition  and paying higher prices  for acquired businesses 

table of contents we must attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  marketing and technical personnel 
to accomplish this  we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  including stock options 
increases in shares available for issuance under our stock options plans require stockholder approval in many cases  and institutional stockholders  or stockholders generally  may not approve future increases 
additionally  there are several proposals in the congress and in the accounting industry to require corporations to include a compensation expense in their statement of operations relating to the issuance of employee stock options 
if such a measure is approved  we may decide to issue fewer stock options 
as a result  we may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel 
our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequately protected from all unauthorized uses 
we regard our software and underlying technology as proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws 
third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar technology independently 
all of our products are protected by copyright laws  and we have a number of patents and patent applications pending 
we may not achieve the desired protection from  and third parties may design around  our patents 
in addition  existing copyright laws afford limited practical protection 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the united states  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products 
any legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from day to day operations 
our products are complex and are operated in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures or bugs may occur when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products often are installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors  failures or bugs in our products 
in the past  we have discovered software errors  failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delays or lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors 
our customers computer environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
despite testing by us and by others  errors  failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments 
errors  failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity  product returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or others 
in addition  if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in one of our end customer s security systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions  delays or cessation of our product licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect results of operations 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our liability 
increased utilization and costs of our technical support services may adversely affect our financial results 
like many companies in the software industry  technical support costs comprise a significant portion of our operating costs and expenses 
over the short term  we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for support services  including periods of high customer usage in which delays may be experienced 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors 
further  customer demand for these services could cause increases in the costs of providing such services and adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity as of march   the fair market value of our financial instruments with exposure to interest risk was approximately usd billion  euro million  and cad million 
sensitivity analysis for a six month horizon was performed on our floating rate and fixed rate financial investments and floating rate liabilities 
parallel shifts in the yield curve of both basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments and floating rate liabilities of less than usd million  less than euro million and less than cad million 
exchange rate sensitivity we conduct business in international currencies through our worldwide operations 
we have established a foreign exchange risk management program  utilizing forward exchange contracts with one fiscal month duration to offset various non functional currency exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in the value of our non functional currency assets and liabilities are offset by gains and losses on the forward exchange contracts to mitigate the risk associated with foreign exchange market fluctuations 
we do not use forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
at the end of each fiscal month  all non functional currency assets and liabilities are revalued using the spot rate of the maturing forward exchange contracts and the realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in net income loss as a component of other income expense 
we believe that the use of forward exchange contracts should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
however  significant changes in exchange rates may still result in adverse effects on our operating results 
we use sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact that market risk exposures may have on the fair market values of our financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analyses consist of all of our foreign currency assets and liabilities and all derivative instruments  principally forward exchange contracts 
the sensitivity analyses assesses the risk of loss in fair market values from the impact of hypothetical changes of instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rates yield curves on market sensitive instruments over a six month horizon 
as of march   the notional amount of our forward contracts was approximately usd million 
a appreciation or devaluation in foreign currencies would result in a decrease in the fair value of our forward exchange contracts by approximately usd million and an increase in the fair value of our forward exchange contracts by usd million  respectively 
as of march   the fair value of our investments in marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies was approximately usd million 
a appreciation or devaluation would result in an increase in the fair value of our investments by approximately usd million and a decrease in the fair value of our investments by usd million  respectively
