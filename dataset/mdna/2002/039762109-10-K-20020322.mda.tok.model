results of operations compared to income before income taxes in increased to  compared to  during operating income increased to  in compared to  in sales from the company s supermarkets all of which are located in southern california were  in this represents an increase of over  when sales were  the majority of the sales increase is attributable to the opening of new stores in irvine  dana point and pasadena  california in september  january and september  respectively 
same store sales increased in compared to the prior year 
the increase in same store sales reflects to some extent the positive impact of store remodel activity and pricing 
in september  the company opened a gelson s market in a multi use center in pasadena  california which is currently performing below management s expectations 
management expects sales to improve as consumers respond to a local advertising and pricing campaign  the apartments located above the store are occupied  existing retail tenants become more established and enhancements to parking and traffic flow are implemented 
however  the occurrence of these events does not guarantee that sales at the pasadena store will increase to originally anticipated levels 
the company s gross profit as a percent of sales was at in compared to in added controls over product costs  product pricing decisions and increased buying and promotional allowances contributed to the increase in margins 
delivery  selling  general and administrative dsg a expense as a percent of sales was in compared to in the company recognized compensation expense related to its phantom stock options and stock appreciation rights of approximately  and  during the fourth quarter and year ended december   respectively  due to an increase in the company s stock price in earnings per share decreased 
and 
per share during the fourth quarter and year ended december   respectively  as a result of these charges to compensation expense compared to 
per share during the fourth quarter and year ended december  salaries and promotions expense in increased due to the opening of new stores  as described above 
in addition  a substantial increase in workers compensation premiums also contributed to the rise in dsg a expense in spite of the company s favorable claims experience 
the company is continually looking for opportunities to reduce costs 
california recently passed legislation aimed at reforming the workers compensation insurance industry in the state 
at this point in time  we are unable to predict how this legislation will impact the insurance industry s rating process  and ultimately  the effect on premiums 
the company believes that premiums could increase substantially beginning with our next policy renewal period commencing on october  while the company continues to devote substantial time and commitment to maintaining favorable safety records and claims experience  this does not preclude the company from potentially experiencing a considerable increase in insurance costs 
a substantial increase in workers compensation premiums could have a negative impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
assuming the stock price of the company s class a common stock remains at the year end price of approximately  the company anticipates compensation expense of approximately  on an after tax basis related to the incremental vesting of phantom stock options and stock appreciation rights 
compensation expense will be adjusted by approximately  after tax for each dollar increase or decrease in the company s stock price 
the exercise of such options or rights could cause these estimates to vary 
the company contributes to several multi employer union pension plans 
contributions to the union pension plan  covering the majority of the company s employees  have been suspended since the pension plan trustees have reserved the right to reinstate the pension contribution with minimal notice 
if reinstated  we anticipate that the additional pension expense could have a significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company is primarily self insured for losses related to general and auto liability claims 
the company carries insurance that covers individual claims in excess of  accruals are based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the company s liability reserve for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims at december  was approximately  while the ultimate amount of claims incurred are dependent on future developments  in management s opinion  recorded reserves are adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
the company also carries workers compensation  property  business interruption  fiduciary  directors and officers  crime  earthquake and special event liability insurance 
management believes that current insurance coverage is adequate to meet the requirements of the company 
the company procures approximately percent of its product through unified western grocers  inc unified  a grocery cooperative 
as a member patron  the company is required to provide unified with certain minimum deposits in order to purchase product from the cooperative 
as of december   the company had approximately  on deposit with unified 
the minimum deposit requirement is satisfied through a combination of cash and ownership of equity shares in unified 
unified has recognized reductions in earned surplus in each of its fiscal years ending september  and september  unified s board of directors has adopted an equity enhancement plan for its fiscal year 
under the equity enhancement plan  member patrons will receive interest bearing subordinated patronage dividend certificates in lieu of amounts previously paid in cash 
the company has historically received less than  annually in patronage dividends in the form of cash and class b shares 
in the event unified continues to incur reductions in earned surplus  the company may face impairment issues relating to the deposits provided to unified

recent accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements will change the accounting for business combinations and goodwill in two significant ways 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method will be prohibited 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
this standard will be effective for the company s fiscal year 
these standards are not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which replaces sfas  accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas establishes one accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for the recognition  measurement and reporting of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
adoption of sfas is required for the company s fiscal year although early application is permitted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company could be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to its  and  revolving lines of credit 
borrowings under the agreements bear interest as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no borrowings outstanding under either agreement as of december  consequently  a hypothetical interest rate change would have no impact on the company s results of operations 
a change in market prices also exposes the company to market risk related to its investments which totaled  as of december  a hypothetical drop in the market value of these investments would result in a  unrealized pretax loss and a corresponding loss of a like amount in the fair value of these instruments 
this hypothetical drop would not affect cash flow and would not have an impact on earnings until the investments were disposed of or the decline is deemed permanent 
in order to minimize the risk associated with market value fluctuations  the company actively manages its exposure through the regular review of its investment portfolio 
the review takes into consideration  among other things  the risk level of the individual investments  the amount invested in each and current economic conditions
