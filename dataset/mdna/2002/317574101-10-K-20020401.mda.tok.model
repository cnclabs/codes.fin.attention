at investors life and investors in  earned insurance charges increased from million in the year to million in the year which includes the pre merger and post merger charges 
the face amount of in force universal life policies at family life was million at december  as compared to million at december  the face amount of in force universal life policies at investors life and investors in was  million at december  as compared to  million at december  net investment income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase in net investment income for the year ended december  was attributable to the consolidation of ilco s operations for the period from may  to december  at investors life and investors in net investment income decreased from million in to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on short term investments as well as the sale of investments to pay for the continued construction at river place pointe 
see investments real estate for a description of the river place pointe investment 
the level of net investment income contributed by the investment portfolio of family life for the year ended december  was million 
net investment income at family life was adversely affected by the decline in the level of interest income received from fixed income and short term investments 
this decline is attributable to lower interest rates during the period 
the net investment income was approximately level from the year ended and mainly due to the long term portfolio remaining level while short term investments were decreasing and the short term rates were increasing 
net real estate income was million for the year ended december   as compared to in and real estate income is attributable to the inclusion of ilco s investment income with fic s from the period from may  to december  real estate income is earned from the leases on the buildings at river place pointe  which is owned by investors life

at family life  the level of policyholder benefits and expenses decreased from million for the year to million for the year  which decrease is attributable to a decrease in death benefit claims as well as a decrease in reserves due to a higher than expected lapse rates in family life s traditional life business 
interest expense on contract holders deposit funds was million for the year  as compared to million in each of the years and this increase is primarily attributable to million of interest expense on contract holders deposit funds resulting from the consolidation of ilco s operations following the merger 
this expense is related to payment of interest to policyholders for cash values accumulated in their accounts 
the expense related to the amortization of present value of future profits of acquired businesses was million for the year ended december   as compared to million at december  and million at december  the consolidation of ilco s amortization expense with fic s contributed approximately million 
the amortization of present value of future profits decreased by million from to  which is in line with the expected amortization of the remaining book of business 
the amortization of present value of future profits was relatively level from to due to higher than expected lapses at family life  which created a higher rate of amortization 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and certain other variable selling expenses principally commissions  are deferred policy acquisition costs 
the expense related to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for the current period includes costs associated with investors life and investors in only for the period from may  to december   in the amount of approximately million

proc 
for modified endowment contracts 
at family life  million in operating expenses was attributable to commissions paid 
the decrease in operating expenses of  from to is due to a reduction of overall operating expenses in and the reduction of yk conversion expenses incurred in as compared to s expenses 
interest expense for was million  as compared to million in and million in the decrease in the amount of interest expenses from to is attributable to the scheduled reduction in the amount of outstanding indebtedness 
this interest expense is related to the indebtedness owed to investors life by family life corporation and fic and includes the amount of interest for the period from january  to may  the consolidation of ilco s operations with those of fic for periods following the may th merger results in the elimination of this interest expense in the consolidated income statements of fic and thus the post merger interest expense is the decrease of interest expenses from to was consistent with the scheduled pay down of the above mentioned debt to investors life 
the provision for federal income taxes was million in  as compared to million in and million in the inclusion of ilco s results for the period from may  to december  contributed approximately million to the level of federal income taxes 
because of the merger and subsequent consolidation of fic and ilco s provision for federal income taxes  fic was not able to utilize the small company tax deduction  which provided lower tax rates 
the increase in federal income taxes due to the loss of this deduction was  further  for the year ended december  and  fic and ilco each paid  and were each able to deduct million of excess compensation each 
due to the merger  the company will incur approximately  in additional federal income taxes in related to excess compensation since ilco will only be able to deduct approximately  of mr 
mitte s compensation for results of operations three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  for the three month period ended december   fic s net income was million basic and diluted earnings of per common share on revenues of million as compared to the net income of million basic earnings of and diluted earnings of per common share on total revenues of million in the last three months of the increase in net income and total revenues from the three month period ended december  to the same period in is primarily attributable to the consolidation of ilco s operations into fic s statements of income for the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
fic is an insurance holding company whose principal assets consist of the outstanding capital stock of its insurance subsidiaries family life insurance company family life  investors life insurance company of north america investors life  and prior to february   investors life insurance company of indiana investors in 
prior to the merger of fic and ilco on may   the principal assets of fic consisted of the common stock of its insurance subsidiary  family life and its equity ownership in ilco 
as a holding company  fic s ability to meet its cash requirements  pay interest on any debt  pay expenses related to its affairs and pay dividends on its common stock substantially depends upon dividends from its subsidiaries 
prior to june  the principal source of liquidity for fic and its wholly owned subsidiary  family life corporation  consisted of the periodic payment of principal and interest by family life pursuant to the terms of the surplus debenture issued in connection with the family life acquisition from merrill lynch 
during  family life made principal payments of million and interest payments of million to family life corporation pursuant to the terms of the surplus debenture 
the surplus debenture was completely paid off as of june  for periods subsequent to june   fic s available source of liquidity will be dividends paid to it from its subsidiaries 
applicable state insurance laws generally restrict the ability of insurance companies to pay cash dividends in excess of prescribed limitations without prior approval 
the ability of family life and investors life to pay shareholder dividends is and will continue to be subject to restrictions set forth in the insurance laws and regulations of washington  their domiciliary state 
washington limits how and when family life and investors life can pay shareholder dividends by a including the greater of standard for payment of dividends to shareholders  b requiring that prior notification of a proposed dividend be given to the washington insurance commissioner and c requiring that cash dividends be paid only from earned surplus 
under the greater of standard  an insurer may pay a dividend in an amount equal to the greater of i of the policyholder surplus or ii the insurer s net gain from operations for the previous year 
in  investors life paid a dividend to its parent corporation  ilco  of  based upon earned surplus of million and net gain from operations of million in the year 
ilco  a holding company  does not have any restrictions on payments of dividends and paid a dividend of  to fic in december family life did not have earned surplus in as defined by the regulations adopted by the washington insurance commissioner and  therefore  was not permitted to pay cash dividends during the million in payments required by family life under the surplus debenture which was paid off in june contributed to family life s absence of earned surplus in as of december   investors life had earned surplus of million and a net gain from operations of million  and family life had earned surplus of million and a net gain from operations of million 
family life s earned surplus in was negatively affected by a million increase in its reserves for flexible premium universal life insurance 
this increase was the result of an implementation of washington s interpretation with respect to reserve methodology for flexible premium universal life insurance policies  which interpretation differs from that of the naic 
prior to the merger of investors life and investors in in february  investors in was domiciled in the state of indiana 
under the indiana insurance code  a domestic insurer may make dividend distributions upon proper notice to the department of insurance  as long as the distribution is reasonable in relation to adequate levels of policyholder surplus and quality of earnings 
under indiana law the dividend must be paid from earned surplus 
investors in had earned surplus of million at december  and earned surplus of million at december  investors in did not make any dividend payments during sources of cash for fic s insurance subsidiaries consist of premium payments from policyholders and annuity holders  charges on policies and contracts  investment income  and proceeds from the sale of investment assets 
these funds are applied primarily to provide for the payment of claims under insurance and annuity policies  payment of policy withdrawals  surrenders and loans  operating expenses  taxes  investments in portfolio securities  and shareholder dividends 
fic s cash and cash equivalents at december  was million as compared to million at december  and million at december  the million increase in cash and cash equivalents at december  from was due primarily to a the merger and the cash acquired in the purchase 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents from to was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow from investing activities due to a decrease in short term invested assets 
fic s net cash flow used in operating activities was million for the year  as compared to million for the year and million for the year the decrease in cash used in operating activities of million from to was attributable to a higher than expected level of surrenders of insurance and annuity policies which contributed to a larger decrease in policy liabilities 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities from to can be attributed to an increase in deferred federal income taxes of million 
net cash flow provided by investing activities was million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase in cash provided by investing activities from to was due to the purchase of ilco  which provided million  and a million increase in proceeds from short term investments 
these amounts were offset by a million capitalization of real estate 
the increase in cash provided by investing from to was primarily attributable to proceeds from a net decrease in short term investments 
net cash flow used in financing activities was million in  as compared to million in and million in payment of cash dividends to stockholders attributed to million of cash used in financing for  as compared to only million in and in  however  repayment of subordinated notes payable decreased from million in to million in due to the merger 
contractholder deposits provided million to cash from financing activities in and contractholder withdrawals used million which was an increase from and due to the inclusion of ilco s cash flows for the period following the merger 
a primary liquidity consideration with respect to life insurance and annuity products is the risk of early policyholder and contractholder withdrawal 
deposit fund liabilities for universal life and annuity products as of december  were million 
individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than are annuity contracts because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
at december   the bulk of the liabilities for contractholder deposit funds on fic s balance sheet  million  were related to insurance products  as compared to only million of annuity product liabilities 
the cash requirements of fic  and its holding company subsidiary  family life corporation  consist primarily of its service of the indebtedness created in connection with fic s ownership of family life 
as of december   the investment portfolio of investors life included million of notes receivable from affiliates  represented by i a loan of million by investors life to family life corporation made in july  in connection with the prepayment of indebtedness which had been previously issued to merrill lynch as part of the acquisition of family life insurance company by a wholly owned subsidiary of fic  and ii a loan of million by investors life to family life insurance investment company made in july  in connection with the same transaction described above 
prior to september   the investment portfolio of investors life also included a million loan from investors life to family life corporation and a million loan from investors ca which was subsequently merged into investors life to fic and million of additions to the million note made in accordance with the terms of such note  which loans were fully paid on september  the provisions of the notes owned by investors life include the following provisions a the million note provides for quarterly principal payments  in the amount of  each for the period december  to september   beginning with the principal payment due on december   the amount of the principal payment increases to  the final quarterly principal payment is due on september   the interest rate on the note remains at  and b the million note provides for quarterly principal payments  in the amount of  each for the period december  to september   beginning with the principal payment due on december   the amount of the principal payment increases to  the final quarterly principal payment is due on september   the interest rate on the note remains at as of december   the outstanding balance of such indebtedness was million on the subordinated loan granted by investors life 
due to the merger  this indebtedness is not included as a liability on the consolidated financial statements of fic 
fic s other liquidity requirements relate principally to the need for cash flow to meet operating expenses  as well as the liabilities associated with its insurance subsidiaries various life insurance and annuity products 
given the historical cash flow of our subsidiaries and the current financial results  management believes that the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of fic and its subsidiaries are sufficient to meet the needs of its business and to satisfy debt service 
there are no trends  commitments or capital asset requirements that are expected to have an adverse effect on the liquidity of fic 
investments overall composition of investments 
invested assets  excluding separate accounts  totaled million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of ilco s invested assets on fic s consolidated balance sheets after the may th merger 
of fic s invested assets are in fixed maturity securities  available for sale 
all of fic s invested assets are invested in the united states 
the most significant differences between the portfolio composition as of december  as compared to december  are investments in real estate  mortgage loans  and fixed maturities held to maturity  as well as an increase in investments in policy loans 
prior to the may  merger  fic did not have any invested real estate  mortgage loans  or fixed maturities held to maturity 
the assets held by family life and investors life must comply with applicable state insurance laws and regulations 
in selecting investments for the portfolios of its life insurance subsidiaries  the company s emphasis is to obtain targeted profit margins  while minimizing the exposure to changing interest rates 
this objective is implemented by selecting primarily short to medium term  investment grade fixed income securities 
in making such portfolio selections  the company generally does not select new investments which are commonly referred to as high yield or non investment grade 
we determine the allocation of our assets primarily on the basis of cash flow and return requirements of our products and secondarily by the level of investment risk 
another key element of the company s investment strategy is to avoid large exposure in other investment categories which the company believes carry higher credit or liquidity risks  including private placements  partnerships and bank participations 
these categories accounted for only  of invested assets at december  as compared to the private placements are holdings of investors life and thus were not on the consolidated balance sheet of fic for the year fixed maturity securities 
our fixed maturity securities portfolio is predominately comprised of low risk  investment grade  available for sale publicly traded corporate securities  mortgage backed securities and united states government bonds 
as of december   the market value of the fixed maturities available for sale segment was million as compared to an amortized cost of million or an unrealized gain of million 
the increase reflects unrealized gains on such investments related to changes in interest rates subsequent to the purchase of such investments 
a portion million of the unrealized gain has been recorded as a decrease in deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits of acquired businesses on the consolidated balance sheet 
the net of tax effect of the remainder of this increase million has been recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income as an increase in shareholders equity 
the investments of fic s insurance subsidiaries in mortgage backed securities included collateralized mortgage obligations cmos of million  and mortgage backed pass through securities of million  at december  mortgage backed pass through securities  sequential cmo s and support bonds  which comprised approximately of the book value of fic s mortgage backed securities at december   are sensitive to prepayment and extension risks 
fic s insurance subsidiaries have reduced the risk of prepayment associated with mortgage backed securities by investing in planned amortization class pac  target amortization class tac instruments and scheduled bonds 
these investments are designed to amortize in a predictable manner by shifting the risk of prepayment of the underlying collateral to other investors in other tranches support classes of the cmo 
at december   pac and tac instruments and scheduled bonds represented approximately of the book value of fic s mortgage backed securities 
sequential and support classes represented approximately of the book value of fic s mortgage backed securities at december  in addition  fic s insurance subsidiaries limit the risk of prepayment of cmos by not paying a premium for any cmos 
fic s insurance subsidiaries do not invest in mortgage backed securities with increased prepayment risk  such as interest only stripped pass through securities and inverse floater bonds 
fic s insurance subsidiaries did not have any z accrual bonds as of december  the prepayment risk that certain mortgage backed securities are subject to is prevalent in periods of declining interest rates  when mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as individuals refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of the lower current rates 
as a result  holders of mortgage backed securities may receive large prepayments on their investments which cannot be reinvested at an interest rate comparable to the rate on the prepaying mortgages 
for the year  the investment objectives of fic s insurance subsidiaries include the making of selected investments in cmos 
the securities valuation office svo of the national association of insurance commissioners evaluates all public and private bonds purchased as investments by insurance companies 
the svo assigns one of six investment categories to each security it reviews 
category is the highest quality rating  and category is the lowest 
as of december   the majority of our bonds   are investment grade category and 
the company s fixed maturities portfolio including short term investments  included only a non material amount of total fixed maturities and short term investments of debt securities which  in the annual statements of the companies as filed with state insurance departments  were designated by the svo as medium quality or below 
this number is attributable to mortgage bonds which investors life owns in a california utility  which has been downgraded to a lowest quality rating by the naic 
as of december   investors life owned bonds in southern california edison which were purchased for million and had a market value as of december  of million 
prior to december   investors life also owned mortgage bonds in pacific gas electric which were sold during at a loss of  and southern california edison which were sold during at a loss of  and investors in also owned bonds in southern california edison which were sold at a loss of  during fic s short term investments consist primarily of us government bonds 
the level of short term investments at december  was million  as compared to million as of december  this increase is also primarily attributable to the inclusion of the assets of ilco in the consolidated financial statements of fic 
real estate 
invested real estate at december  was million 
at december   fic did not have any assets invested in real estate 
the change is attributable to the consolidation of ilco s financial results with fic following the may th merger 
the real estate investment is primarily related to the development of the river place pointe project river place pointe by investors life  a subsidiary of ilco 
in october  investors life purchased river place pointe  two adjoining tracts of land located in austin  texas totaling acres 
the aggregate purchase price for these tracts was million 
investors life obtained a site development permit for the tracts from the city of austin allowing for the construction of seven office buildings totaling  square feet  with associated parking  drives and related improvements 
construction on the first section of the project  which consists of four office buildings  an associated parking garage  and related infrastructure was completed during and construction on the second section continued during the third and fourth quarter of  including work on buildings six and seven 
completion of the entire project is expected by the end of as of december   investors life had expended million in the construction of river place pointe 
investors life expects to pay million during to finish construction on the project 
fic and its insurance subsidiaries occupy almost the entire building one of river place pointe  consisting of approximately  square feet of space 
as of december    rentable square feet of office space was leased and  rentable square feet was available for lease 
upon the completion of the second section of the project  which includes three more office buildings  there will be  additional rentable square feet available for lease 
at december   the office vacancy rate in austin  texas  was according to a study released by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
the study also found that austin had the highest percent of new office real estate space under construction in relation to existing space at december  mortgage loans 
as of december   only million was invested in mortgage loans as compared to at december  the increase is due to the inclusion of investors life s assets on fic s consolidated balance sheet for the year at december   ilco s balance sheets included a million investment in mortgage loans 
the company does not make new mortgage loans on commercial properties 
substantially all of the company s mortgage loans were made by its subsidiaries prior to their acquisition by the company 
at december   none of the mortgage loans held by the company had defaulted as to principal or interest for more than days  and none of the company s mortgage loans were in foreclosure 
policy loans 
policy loans totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase was attributable to the inclusion of ilco s assets on the consolidated balance sheets following the merger 
ilco s balance sheets at december  included million in policy loans 
management believes that the absence of high yield or non investment grade investments as defined above in the portfolios of fic s life insurance subsidiaries enhances the ability of the company to service its debt  provide security to its policyholders and to credit relatively consistent rates of return to its policyholders 
critical accounting policies the financial statements contain a summary of fic s critical accounting policies  including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
certain of these policies are considered to be important to the portrayal of fic s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies include valuation of investments  deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits  and future policy benefits 
for the year  the company s critical accounting policies also included the purchase accounting for ilco 
investments 
the company s investments primarily consist of fixed maturity securities  which include bonds  notes and redeemable preferred stocks 
fair values of investments in fixed securities are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes 
fixed maturities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value  with unrealized investment gains and losses  net of income taxes  credited or charged directly to shareholder s equity 
when an impairment of the value of an investment is considered other than temporary  the decrease in value is reported in net income as a realized investment loss and a new cost basis is established 
deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits 
costs of acquiring individual life insurance and annuities  principally commissions and certain expenses related to policy issuance  underwriting and marketing  all of which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business  are deferred 
acquisition costs relating to traditional life insurance  including term insurance  are amortized in relation to anticipated premiums 
universal life costs are amortized in relation to estimated gross profits  and annuity contracts employ a level yield method 
for life insurance  a to year amortization period is used  and a to year period is employed for annuities 
future policy benefits 
future policy benefits comprise of fic s total liabilities at december  these liabilities are estimated using actuarial methods based on assumptions about premiums  interest yields  investment returns  expenses  mortality  morbidity  and persistency 
these assumptions consider company experience and industry standards 
the assumptions vary by plan  age at issue  year of issue and duration 
purchase accounting for ilco 
the acquisition of ilco was accounted for as a purchase  accordingly  the results of ilco s operations since the may  merger are included in fic s consolidated results of operations at december  the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition were estimated based on an analysis  as of may   of the acquired book of business 
the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired resulted in excess of net assets acquired over cost  or negative goodwill 
upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  business combinations  during the first quarter of  the amount of any unamortized deferred credit related to the negative goodwill arising from the merger shall be recognized and reported as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
the effect of the accounting change and related income tax effects shall be presented in the income statement between the captions extraordinary items and net income 
for the period from january  to may   and for the years and  fic s net income includes its equity interest in the net income of ilco  with such equity interest being based on fic s percentage ownership of ilco 
for a further discussion of accounting standards  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f events of september  family life incurred and paid  of death benefits as a result of the september  events 
the company is not aware of any unreported losses or claims resulting of such events 
subsequent events merger of investors life and investors in 
on february   investors in was merged with and into investors life  whereby investors life was the surviving corporation 
the merger was approved by the washington department of insurance in january and by the indiana department of insurance in february investors life will assume all of the assets and liabilities of investors in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
fic s principal assets are financial instruments  which are subject to market risks 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates  principally interest rates on fixed rate investments 
for a discussion of the company s investment portfolio and the management of that portfolio to reflect the nature of the underlying insurance obligations of the company s insurance subsidiaries  please refer to the sections entitled acquisition of ilco and investment of assets in item of this report and the information set forth in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations investments 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk sensitive instruments 
it should be noted that this discussion has been developed using estimates and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those described below 
further  the following discussion does not take into account actions which could be taken by management in response to the assumed changes in market rates 
in addition  the discussion does not take into account other types of risks which may be involved in the business operations of the company  such as the reinsurance recoveries on reinsurance treaties with third party insurers 
the primary market risk to the company s investment portfolio is interest rate risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk the company manages the interest rate risk inherent in our assets relative to the interest rate risk inherent in our liabilities 
generally  we manage interest rate risk based on the application of a commonly used model 
the model projects the impact of interest rate changes on a range of factors  including duration and potential prepayment 
for example  assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the net hypothetical loss in fair market value related to the financial instruments segment of the company s balance sheet is estimated to be million at december  and million at december  for purposes of the foregoing estimate  fixed maturities  including fixed maturities available for sale  and short term investments were taken into account 
the market value of such assets was million at december  and million at december  the fixed income investments of the company include certain mortgage backed securities 
the market value of such securities was million at december  and million at december  assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the net hypothetical loss in the fair market value related to such mortgage backed securities is estimated to be million at december  and million at december  separate account assets have not been included  since gains and losses on those assets generally accrue to the policyholders 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manager our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the hypothetical effect of the interest rate risk on fair values was estimated by applying a commonly used model 
the model projects the impact of interest rate changes on a range of factors  including duration and potential prepayment
