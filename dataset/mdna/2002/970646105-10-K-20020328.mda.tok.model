item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
the company s core focus is providing operating leases of aftermarket commercial aircraft engines and other aircraft related equipment 
as of december   the company had a total portfolio including engines counted as discontinued operations of lessees in countries and its total lease portfolio consisted of engines  six commuter aircraft and four spare parts packages with an aggregate net book value of million 
the company actively manages its portfolio and structures its leases in order to enhance residual values of leased assets 
the company s leasing business focuses on popular stage iii commercial jet aircraft engines manufactured by cfm  general electric  pratt whitney  rolls royce and international aero engines 
these engines are the most widely used aircraft engines in the world  powering boeing  mcdonnell douglas and airbus aircraft 
on november   the company sold its parts subsidiary  wasi  and its interest in its engine repair joint venture  pgtc llc 
with the sale of these two businesses  the company no longer engages in the business of parts sales or in disassembly  repair  maintenance and overhaul of aircraft engines  and its core focus is its leasing portfolio  including sales of leased equipment and equipment acquired for resale 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to residual values  estimated asset lives  bad debts  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
leasing related activities 
revenue from leasing of aircraft equipment is recognized as operating lease or finance lease revenue over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
where collection cannot be reasonably assured  for example  upon a lessee bankruptcy  the company does not recognize revenue 
the company also estimates and charges to income a provision for bad debts based on its experience in the business and with each specific customer and the level of past due accounts 
the financial condition of the company s customers may deteriorate and result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
in addition  any deterioration in the financial condition of the company s customers may adversely effect future lease revenues 
the vast majority of the company s leases are accounted for as operating leases 
under an operating lease  the company retains title to the leased equipment  thereby retaining the potential benefit and assuming the risk of the residual value of the leased equipment 
the company generally depreciates engines on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
spare parts packages are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
aircraft are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
for assets that are leased with an intent to disassemble upon lease termination  the company depreciates the assets over their estimated lease term to a residual value based on an estimate of the wholesale value of the parts after disassembly 
if useful lives or residual values are lower than those estimated by the company  upon sale of the asset  a loss may be realized 
at the commencement of a lease  the company often collects security deposits normally equal to at least one month s lease payment and maintenance reserves normally equal to one month s estimated maintenance expenses from the lessee based on the creditworthiness of the lessee 
the security deposit is returned to the lessee after all lease conditions have been met 
maintenance reserves are accumulated in accounts maintained by the company or the company s lenders and are used when normal repair associated with engine use or maintenance is required 
in many cases  to the extent that cumulative maintenance reserves are inadequate to fund normal repairs required prior to return of the engine to the company  the lessee is obligated to cover the shortfall 
recovery is dependant on the financial condition of the lessee 
sales related activities 
for equipment sold out of the company s lease portfolio or which was acquired for resale  the company recognizes the gain or loss associated with the sale or the gross proceeds from equipment acquired for resale as revenue 
gain consists of sales proceeds less the net book value of the equipment sold and any costs directly associated with the sale 
additionally  to the extent that any deposits or reserves are not included in the sale and the purchaser of the equipment assumes any liabilities associated therewith  such deposits and reserves are included in the gain on sale 
asset valuation 
the company periodically reviews its portfolio of assets for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
such review necessitates estimates of current market values  residual values and component values 
the estimates are based on currently available market data and are subject to fluctuation from time to time 
the company initiates its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds it fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected undiscounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs may occur 
for further information on these and other accounting policies adopted by the company  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the statement will be effective on january  and the company is currently assessing the impact its adoption will have on the financial condition and operating results of the company 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its growth through borrowings secured by its equipment lease portfolio 
cash of approximately million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from this activity 
in these same time periods million  million and million  respectively  was used to pay down related debt or capital lease obligations 
on november   net proceeds from a private placement of common stock and options were approximately million 
cash flow from operating activities generated million  million and million in the years ended december   and respectively 
the company s primary use of funds is for the purchase of equipment for lease 
approximately million  million and million of funds were used for this purpose in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from operations are driven significantly by changes in revenue 
while the company has experienced some deterioration in lease rates  these have been offset by reductions in interest rates such that the spread between lease rates and interest rates has remained relatively constant throughout the period 
the lease revenue stream  in the short term  is at fixed rates while a substantial amount of the company s debt is at variable rates 
if interest rates increase it is unlikely the company could increase lease rates in the short term and this would cause a reduction in the company s earnings 
however  utilization has decreased with approximately  by book value  of the company s assets off lease at december   compared to approximately at december  increases in off lease rates as well as deterioration in lease rates that are not offset by reduction in interest rates  will have a negative impact in earnings and cash flows from operations 
it is likely in the short term that off lease rates may increase 
at december   the company had a million revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of aircraft engines  aircraft and spare parts for lease as well as for general working capital purposes 
as of december   million was available under this facility 
the facility matures in may the interest rate on this facility at december  is libor plus 
at december   the company had a million revolving credit facility with a financial institution 
borrowings under the facility accrue interest at a rate of libor plus per annum and are secured by specific engines and leases pledged to the lender 
the facility has a month revolving period which may be renewed annually by agreement between the company and the lender 
borrowings under the facility have maturities that coincide with the maturities of the individual leases serving as collateral 
at december   the company had million available under this facility 
at december   the company had a million debt warehouse facility 
the facility is available to a wholly owned special purpose finance subsidiary of the company  wlfc funding corporation  for the financing of jet aircraft engines acquired by or transferred to such finance subsidiary by the company 
the facility is renewable annually 
this facility s structure facilitates public or private securitized note issuances by the special purpose finance subsidiary 
the subsidiary is consolidated for financial statement presentation purposes 
the facility has an eight year initial term with a revolving period that originally expired on february  and has been extended to april followed by a seven year amortization period 
during the extension period the company is not permitted to borrow against this facility 
the company is currently in negotiations to renew this facility 
at december   the interest rate was a commercial paper based rate plus a spread of 
at december  the commercial paper rate was 
the company has guaranteed the obligations under the facility on a limited basis  up to an amount equal to the greater of i the lesser of million and of the outstanding obligations or ii of the outstanding obligations 
at december   million was available under this facility 
at december  the company had a million term loan facility available to a wholly owned consolidated special purpose subsidiary of the company  wlfc ac corporation  for the financing of jet aircraft engines transferred by the company to such subsidiary 
the facility is a five year term loan with final maturity of june  the interest rate is currently libor plus 
this facility is fully drawn 
approximately million of the company s debt is repayable during such repayments consist of scheduled installments due under term loans 
the table below summarizes the company s contractual commitments at december  contractual payments due in thousands contractual obligation thereafter total debt operating leases on company premises approximately million of the above debt is subject to the company continuing to comply with the covenants of each financing  including debt equity ratios  minimum tangible net worth and minimum interest coverage ratios  and other eligibility criteria including customer and geographic concentration restrictions 
in addition  the company can typically borrow between to of an engine purchase price and only between to of an aircraft or spare parts purchase price under these facilities  so the company must have other available funds for the balance of the purchase price of any new equipment to be purchased or it will not be permitted to draw on these facilities for a particular purchase 
the facilities are also cross defaulted 
if the company does not comply with the covenants or eligibility requirements  the company may not be permitted to borrow additional funds and accelerated payments may become necessary 
additionally  debt is secured by engines on lease to customers and to the extent that engines are returned from lease early or are sold  repayment of that portion of the debt could be accelerated 
as a result of the floating rate structure of the majority of the company s borrowings  the company s interest expense associated with borrowings will vary with market rates 
in addition  commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the facilities 
the company also holds a interest  accounted for under the cost method  in a joint venture in china  sichuan snecma aero engine maintenance co 
ltd 
the company has invested million to date and has a commitment to fund not more than an additional million over the next three years 
the company believes that its current equity base  internally generated funds and existing debt facilities are sufficient to maintain the company s current level of operations 
a decline in the level of internally generated funds such as could result if off lease rates continue to increase or the availability under the company s existing debt facilities would impair the company s ability to sustain its current level of operations 
the company is currently discussing additions to its debt base with its commercial and investment banks 
if the company is not able to access additional debt  its ability to continue to grow its asset base consistent with historical trends will be impaired and its future growth limited to that which can be funded from internally generated capital 
management of interest rate exposure to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements which have notional outstanding amounts of million  remaining terms of between and months and fixed rates of between and 
interest expense for the year ended december  has increased by approximately million due to the interest rate hedges 
as a result of the adoption of sfas the company recorded liabilities under derivative investments of million and a charge to other comprehensive loss of million net of tax see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company will be exposed to risk in the event of non performance of the interest rate hedge counter parties 
the company may hedge additional amounts of its floating rate debt during the next year 
related party and similar transactions the company continues to use pgtc llc s services to repair refurbish engines prior to sale or re lease 
the company also sold engines to avioserv during and has notified its intention in january  to exercise put options with respect to further engines and intends to close the puts during the second quarter 
the company entered into a business cooperation period with flightlease and srt ending on november  by which flightlease and srt have price discounts and lowest price guarantees on short term and long term engine leases from the company 
flightlease and srt in turn will provide the company with access to spare engines  will promote the company s engine leasing efforts and the development of other products  and will facilitate business opportunities among the company and flightlease s and srt s other business partners 
during the year ended december  there were no transactions initiated by either party under the cooperation agreement 
the company has also entered into put option arrangements regarding certain engines scheduled to be run to the end of their useful lives to sell them at the company s discretion  to srt at pre determined prices 
flightlease and srt are members of flighttechnics  llc an entity which owns of the company s common stock 
factors that may affect future results except for historical information contained herein  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of the company s plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
forward looking statements give the company s expectations about the future and are not guarantees 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and the company does not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report or in other written or oral statements by the company 
the businesses in which the company is engaged are capital intensive businesses 
accordingly  the company s ability to successfully execute its business strategy and to sustain its operations is dependent  in large part  on the availability of debt and equity capital 
there can be no assurance that the necessary amount of capital will continue to be available to the company on favorable terms or at all 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient capital  or to renew its credit facilities could result in increased funding costs and would limit the company s ability to i add new aircraft engines  aircraft and spare parts packages to its portfolio  ii fund its working capital needs  and iii finance possible future acquisitions 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient capital would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company retains title to the aircraft engines  aircraft and parts packages that it leases to third parties 
upon termination of a lease  the company will seek to re lease or sell the aircraft or aircraft equipment 
the company also engages in the selective purchase and resale of commercial aircraft engines 
on occasion  the company purchases engines without having a firm commitment for their sale 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may have an impact on the company s ability to re lease or sell aircraft equipment on a timely basis  including the following i general market conditions  ii the condition of the aircraft equipment upon termination of the lease  iii the maintenance services performed during the lease term and  as applicable  the number of hours remaining until the next major maintenance is required  iv regulatory changes particularly those imposing environmental  maintenance and other requirements on the operation of aircraft engines  v changes in the supply of  or demand for  or cost of aircraft engines  and vi technological developments 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to re lease or sell aircraft equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms 
the failure to re lease or sell aircraft equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company experiences fluctuations in its operating results 
such fluctuations may be due to a number of factors  including i general economic conditions  ii the timing of sales of engines  iii financial difficulties experienced by airlines  iv interest rates  v downturns in the air transportation industry  vi decreases in growth or decline of air traffic  vii unanticipated early lease termination or a default by a lessee  viii the timing of engine acquisitions  ix engine marketing activities  x fluctuations in market prices for the company s assets 
the company anticipates that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
as a result  the company believes that comparisons to results of operations for preceding periods are not necessarily meaningful and that results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the company s future operating results may be adversely impacted by the unparalleled challenges faced by the airline industry due to a combination of the terrorist attacks in new york and washington dc on september  and the current worldwide economic slowdown that has occurred both before and after the attacks 
airlines are facing various increased costs  including insurance premiums and security costs  while at the same time suffering from reduction in demand by air travelers 
financially weaker airlines are likely to be subject to the greatest negative impacts  and many airlines have taken some of their aircraft out of service in response to the fall or could be forced off in air travel 
older aircraft have been grounded since they usually have higher operating costs 
some airlines have been forced or could be forced to take more drastic measures that include debt rescheduling  deferral of lease payments or even filing for protection from creditors 
the airlines various cutbacks have had some trickle down effects on the company  and may have increasingly negative effects on the company 
the ultimate effects will  in part  depend upon the ability of individual airlines to meet their obligations when due 
some of the negative impacts on the company s business may include the following i financing sources may be less willing to lend additional money to the company because of the uncertainty currently surrounding the airline industry  ii the company s current decrease in equipment utilization levels may continue because it takes more time for the company to remarket off lease engines when airlines demand for spare engines decreases  iii the company may be subject to payment delays if the company grants airlines requests that the company allow payment deferrals and offer other forms of payment relief  iv prices that the company receives for sales of engines could be negatively impacted  or the company may be unable to sell engines at prices that it deems acceptable  as the demand for certain spare engines decreases and v values of engines retained in the portfolio may be negatively impacted 
because of the foregoing risks and the uncertainties surrounding the airline industry the company cannot forecast with any degree of accuracy what the future impacts on it will be 
sr technics  the company s largest customer  unlike its parent sairgroup and certain other sairgroup entities  is not presently under protection from creditors 
in addition  sr technics is for sale and presently attempting to locate additional investors to ensure its long term future through a new ownership structure 
if sr technics financial condition deteriorates  this will increase the likelihood of defaults by sr technics on its obligations to the company 
sr technics has leased five engines with a book value of approximately million from the company with lease terms expiring in up to nine years 
if sr technics becomes insolvent or otherwise stops making its rent payments  the company s leases allow the company to repossess the engines 
if such a situation were to occur  the company faces a variety of risks and uncertainties  including the following a the company may experience delays imposed by swiss bankruptcy courts as it seeks to repossess the engines  b the company s percentage of off lease engines may increase if the company attempts to re lease or remarket the sr technics engines  c the other risks discussed in this section with respect to off lease equipment and d the company may not be able to exercise its put options with sr technics affiliates 
all of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
on november   canada inc  a lessee that leased engines and parts packages with a total net book value of million and lease terms of up to years  was placed into bankruptcy and ceased operation 
the revenue since november from these leases has not been recognized by the company for all uncollectible amounts 
at december   the net amount of accounts receivable recorded on the balance sheet was the company has retained canadian counsel to assist in the recovery of its assets  and all engines and approximately two thirds of the parts package have been returned to date 
two engines with a book value of million were recovered during the fourth quarter and were successfully re leased to other customers  and the remaining engines were recovered in january for which the company is actively seeking re leasing opportunities 
approximately two thirds of the parts package has been recovered to date with the remainder expected to be returned in the coming months 
the company holds security deposits  prepaid rents and a letter of credit that may be used to partially recoup costs and expenses associated with the early termination of the leases with canada  subject to the final approval of the canadian bankruptcy court 
in connection with canada s bankruptcy  the company faces a variety of risks and uncertainties  including the following a the company may experience delays imposed by the canadian bankruptcy court as it seeks to repossess the remaining equipment  b the company s percentage of off lease equipment may increase while the company attempts to re lease or remarket the canada equipment  c the company could incur transportation and storage expenses in connection with retrieving the equipment and may not be able to lease the equipment at the same lease rates as were being paid by canada  and d the other risks discussed in this section with respect to off lease equipment 
a lessee may default in performance of its lease obligations and the company may be unable to enforce its remedies under a lease 
the company s inability to collect receivables due under a lease or to repossess aircraft equipment in the event of a default by a lessee could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
various airlines have experienced financial difficulties in the past  certain airlines have filed for bankruptcy and a number of such airlines have ceased operations 
in most cases where a debtor seeks protection under chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code  creditors are automatically stayed from enforcing their rights 
in the case of united states certified airlines  section of the bankruptcy code provides certain relief to lessors of aircraft equipment 
the scope of section has been the subject of significant litigation and there is no assurance that the provisions of section will protect the company s investment in an aircraft  aircraft engines or parts in the event of a lessee s bankruptcy 
in addition  section does not apply to lessees located outside of the united states and applicable foreign laws may not provide comparable protection 
leases of spare parts may involve additional risks 
for example  it is likely to be more difficult to recover parts in the event of a lessee default and the residual value of parts may be less ascertainable than an engine 
the company s leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms while many of the company s borrowings are at floating rates 
increases in interest rates could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue the company realizes under its leases and the interest rate the company pays under its borrowings  and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
in  of the company s lease revenue was generated by leases to foreign customers 
such international leases may present greater risks to the company because certain foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may not be as protective of lessor rights as those which apply in the united states 
all leases require payment in united states us currency 
if these lessees currency devalues against the us dollar  the lessees could potentially encounter difficulty in making the us dollar denominated payment 
the company is also subject to the timing and access to courts and the remedies local laws impose in order to collect its lease payments and recover its assets 
in addition  political instability abroad and changes in international policy also present risk of expropriation of the company s leased engines 
furthermore  many foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating the international transfer of currencies 
the company has experienced significant growth in lease revenues during the past year 
the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations  or that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations  in which event the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company may also acquire businesses that would complement or expand the company s existing businesses 
any acquisition or expansion made by the company may result in one or more of the following events i the incurrence of additional debt  ii future charges to earnings related to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  iii difficulties in the assimilation of operations  services  products and personnel  iv an inability to sustain or improve historical revenue levels  v diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations  and vi potential loss of key employees 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the markets for the company s products and services are extremely competitive  and the company faces competition from a number of sources 
these include aircraft  engine and aircraft parts manufacturers  aircraft and aircraft engine lessors and airline and aircraft service and repair companies 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources than the company  including greater name recognition  a broader range of material  complementary lines of business and greater financial  marketing and other resources 
in addition  equipment manufacturers  and other aviation aftermarket suppliers may vertically integrate into the markets that the company serves  thereby significantly increasing industry competition 
there can be no assurance that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company s leasing activities generate significant depreciation allowances that provide the company with substantial tax benefits on an ongoing basis 
in addition  the company s lessees currently enjoy favorable accounting and tax treatment by entering into operating leases 
any change to current tax laws or accounting principles that make operating lease financing less attractive or affect the company s recognition of revenue or expense would have a material impact on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company obtains a substantial portion of its inventories of aircraft and engines from airlines  overhaul facilities and other suppliers 
there is no organized market for aircraft and engines  and the company must rely on field representatives and personnel  advertisements and its reputation as a buyer of surplus inventory in order to generate opportunities to purchase such equipment 
the market for bulk sales of surplus aircraft and engines is highly competitive  in some instances involving a bidding process 
while the company has been able to purchase surplus inventory in this manner successfully in the past  there is no assurance that surplus aircraft and engines of the type required by the company s customers will be available on acceptable terms when needed in the future or that the company will continue to compete effectively in the purchase of such surplus equipment 
california continues to experience problems with the supply of power to its residents

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
a change in the us prime interest rate  libor rate  or cost of funds based on commercial paper market rates  would affect the rate at which the company could borrow funds under its various borrowing facilities 
increases in interest rates to the company  which may cause the company to raise the implicit rates charged to its customers  could result in a reduction in demand for the company s leases 
certain of the company s credit facilities are variable rate debt 
the company estimates a one percent increase or decrease in the company s variable rate debt net of hedges would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million per annum in  million per annum 
the company estimates a two percent increase or decrease in the company s variable rate debt net of hedges would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million per annum in  million per annum 
the foregoing effect of interest rate changes on per annum interest expense is estimated as constant due to the terms of the company s variable rate borrowings  which generally provide for the maintenance of borrowing levels given adequacy of collateral and compliance with other loan conditions 
the company hedges a portion of its borrowings  effectively fixing the rate of these borrowings 
the company is currently required to hedge a portion of debt of the wlfc funding corporation facility 
such hedging activities may limit the company s ability to participate in the benefits of any decrease in interest rates  but may also protect the company from increases in interest rates 
furthermore  since lease rates tend to vary with interest rate levels  it is likely that the company can adjust lease rates for the effect of change in interest rates at the termination of leases 
other financial assets and liabilities are at fixed rates 
the company is also exposed to currency devaluation risk 
during  of the company s total lease revenues came from non united states domiciled lessees 
all of the leases require payment in united states us currency 
if these lessees currency devalues against the us dollar  the lessees could potentially encounter difficulty in making the us dollar denominated lease payments
