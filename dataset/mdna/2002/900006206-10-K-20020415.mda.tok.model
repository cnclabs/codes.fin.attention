the company currently sells its c oven through a direct sales force in north america  the united kingdom  europe and asia 
until may  the company s c ovens were marketed in the united states through maytag and its subsidiary  blodgett  pursuant to the terms of a series of agreements in which the company granted them the exclusive right to sell its c ovens in north america 
under the agreements the company retained the right to sell directly outside of north america  with the exception of selling to us based customers overseas 
in the first quarter of  the company and maytag entered into arbitration with respect to certain disputes under the agreements which arbitration is pending 
see item legal proceeding 
in may  the company regained from maytag and blodgett the right to sell its c ovens products directly in the united states and began building its own sales force to make direct oven sales 
the company is currently expanding its direct marketing and sales efforts throughout north america  the united kingdom  europe and asia 
the company s primary sales office is located in dallas  texas 
in addition  the company has sales offices in new york  the united kingdom  and the netherlands 
in addition to its direct sales force  the company is in the process of seeking to develop multiple distribution channels through the use of third party distributors  manufactures representatives  agents and wholesale food distributors 
the company is also considering entering into strategic marketing alliances with third parties who have established relationships or synergies with mutual prospective customers 
in the second quarter of  turbochef established a manufacturing venture with xiaoya  in china in which xiaoya was granted the exclusive manufacturing rights for the c oven 
in march  turbochef signed a new agreement to purchase approximately million of c ovens from xiaoya over the next months 
the company has invested heavily in research  prototype development  strategic alliance development and sales and marketing personnel 
as a result of these investments  and the limited revenues generated to date from sales of ovens  the company has incurred substantial operating losses in each year of its operations including net losses applicable to common shareholders of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to revenues of  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the receipt of  in research and development revenues and minimum royalties recorded in  from maytag and the gas research institute 
research and development revenues from the maytag commercial license agreement ended in the second quarter of cost of sales for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  compared to  for cost of sales for the year ended december  the decrease is principally due to an accrued warranty charge of  in fiscal and a reduction in cost of sales on c oven sales 
no additional warranty charges were deemed necessary during fiscal the warranty charge is associated with a three year upgrade and service agreement with whitbread covering the company s earlier generation commercial ovens 
this extended warranty agreement was terminated in february gross profit on product sales for the year ended december  increased  to  when compared to gross profit loss on product sales of  during the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the improvement in gross margins as a result of the decrease in warranty costs  reduction in the unit costs of the c ovens and higher average selling prices during  as compared to research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased  to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expense principally relates to a reduction in payroll and related expenses of  and prototyping expenses of  in the first half of these expenses were reduced due to the completion of the company s c commercial oven  as well as a decrease in personnel and expenses relating to research and development 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased  to  from comparable expenses of  for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to a decrease in administrative expenses of  as a result of overhead reduction implemented in the first quarter of this was partially offset by increases in sales and marketing expenses of  net other income expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in other income was primarily the result of a one time gain of  which the company recorded when it liquidated its hedged investment in maytag common stock in the fourth quarter of this was partially offset by decreases in interest expense and amortization of  and  respectively  relating to liquidation of it long term debt agreement during fiscal the interest expense in principally relates to a  non cash charge relating to the conversion of a note receivable to preferred stock 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is due to an increase in royalty revenues of  received under the company s commercial license agreement with maytag in the last half of this was offset in part by a decrease in product sales of  which was primarily the result of initial replacement parts inventory sold to the company s oven manufacturer in cost of sales for the year ended december   was  compared to  for cost of sales in the prior year 
greater than expected warranty expense related to initial manufacturing problems associated with the production of the company s c and d series ovens is the primary contributor to an increase in costs 
in addition  the company has written down obsolete inventory by approximately  gross profit loss on product sales for the year ended december  and december  was  and  respectively 
the reduction in gross profit was principally due to the costs relating to the upgrade and extended warranty on products sold and the inventory write down adjustment  as noted above 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased  to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is the result of a decrease in engineering and technical personnel to support the company s commercial countertop product development requirements associated with the maytag commercial license and development agreement 
this decrease was offset by expenditures incurred in the development of the company s next generation residential cooking systems and the ongoing operating costs associated with the company s accelerated life cycle testing facility  established for the durability and reliability testing of the company s products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased  to  from  for the year ended december  the increase over is primarily due to an increase in operating costs of  related to the company s manufacturing joint venture in china 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease of  in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were lower because the company transferred its north american sales and marketing operations to maytag in under the commercial license agreement 
other income expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily the result of the gain of  the company recorded when it liquidated its hedged investment in maytag common stock in the fourth quarter of this gain was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of  which was the result of an increase in outstanding debt used to finance working capital 
liquidity and capital resources turbochef s capital requirements in connection with its product and technology development and marketing efforts have been and will continue to be significant 
additional capital will be required to operate and expand the company s operations 
since its inception  the company has incurred significant operating losses and has been substantially dependent on loans and capital contributions from its principal stockholders and proceeds from the sale of its securities 
furthermore  the company will continue to be dependent on outside sources of financing for the foreseeable future to fund its working capital needs 
the company anticipates that it may need to raise additional capital by the fourth quarter of no assurances can be made that the company will generate the necessary sales from its rapid cook systems or from the proceeds from the sales of its securities or other financing sources to generate the necessary working capital 
as a result of these conditions  the independent certified public accountant s report on the company s financial statements for the year ended december  contains an explanatory paragraph regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the company has  and will continue to hold inventory  due to its long manufacturing cycle

in march  the company agreed to purchase from xiaoya approximately million of c ovens over a seventeen month period 
in addition  in connection with the manufacturing agreement the company will be required to use working capital to purchase certain component parts that will be supplied to xiaoya for use in the ovens 
although the company entered into the agreement with xiaoya in anticipation that its sales of c ovens will increase from current levels  there can be no such assurance that any sales will materialize 
the company does not currently have a significant number of purchase orders or firm commitments to purchase ovens in the future 
the company is currently exploring alternative sources of financing for its inventory and receivables 
no assurances can be made that the company will be successful in developing any of these sources or that any terms that may be offered will be acceptable to the company

sfas prescribes financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and specifies when to test a long lived asset for recoverability 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management does not believe this statement will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states  the company uses statistical analyses  estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results 
the company considers the following accounting policy to be both important to the portrayal of its financial condition and the policy that requires the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on the company s financial statements 
product warranty the company s ovens are under warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year 
anticipated future warranty costs are estimated  based upon historical expenses  and are recorded in the period cooking systems are sold 
risk factors the company operates in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the company s operations 
the following highlights some of the factors that have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s operations 
risks relating to the company s financial condition and operating results the company s auditors expressed substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern in their audit report for the fiscal year ended december  the company s auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit opinion with respect to the company s consolidated financial statements at december  the paragraph states that the company s recurring losses from operations and resulting continued dependence on access to external financing sources and new sales raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
furthermore  the factors leading to and the existence of the explanatory paragraph may adversely affect the company s relationship with customers and suppliers and have an adverse effect on the company s ability to obtain additional financing 
because the company has not generated positive cash flow and its capital requirements are significant  if the company is unable to obtain financing when needed  the company may be required to curtail or cease its operations 
turbochef s capital requirements in connection with its proposed marketing efforts  continuing product development and purchases of inventory and parts are expected to be significant for the foreseeable future 
historically  cash generated from operations have not been sufficient to fund the company s capital requirements 
the company anticipates that it may need to raise additional capital by the fourth quarter of however  if the company s plans change  anticipated revenues do not materialize  or actual expenses exceed estimated expenses the company could be required to obtain additional financing sooner 
the company has been dependent upon sales of its securities to fund its operations 
if the company is unable to raise additional financing if needed  the company may be required to curtail its operations 
the company has historically relied upon sales of securities to fund its operations 
the company has no current arrangements with respect to  or sources of  additional financing 
even if additional funds are available  the company may not be able to obtain them on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to the company 
failure to obtain additional funds when required would result in inadequate capital to operate the company s business in accordance with its plans and require the company to cut back the company s operations  which could result in a further decline in revenues  or to cease its operations 
the company has incurred significant historical losses and expects to continue to incur losses in the future 
the company has incurred net losses applicable to shareholders of million  million and million during the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  the company expects its operating expenses to increase due to the expansion of the company s sales force 
in addition  in prior periods the company has incurred expenses to cover the unanticipated costs of extended warranties 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur significant warranty expense in the future 
moreover  if the company does not achieve significantly increased sales levels  losses will increase 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profitable operations in the future 
the company experienced a substantial decline in revenues from to due to the loss of product royalties and research and development revenues from maytag and gas research institute 
in fiscal year  research and development revenues and royalties from maytag and research and development revenues from gas research institute accounted for and of the company s revenues 
in the first quarter  maytag terminated its license agreement with the company and in fourth quarter its development activities for gas research institute ended 
the company was unable to replace these revenue sources in and  as a result  its revenues declined from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the loss of these revenue sources significantly impacted the company s operating results and cash flow for because of the company s long manufacturing cycle  the company holds significant levels of inventory prior to making sales  which requires the company to use cash in advance of sales and could adversely affect its operating results and cash flows if sales are generated at a slower rate than anticipated 
due to the long manufacturing cycle for its ovens  the company holds a significant level of inventory 
as of december   the company held  of finished goods inventory ovens and  of parts and demonstration inventory 
this process requires the company to use working capital early in the manufacturing cycle and without any certainty of corresponding sales being made 
in addition  the company recently entered into a contract with its manufacturer of ovens which requires the company to purchase million of ovens over a month period 
should sales of ovens fail to materialize  or materialize at slower than anticipated rates  additional working capital will be required to hold component parts and purchase completed ovens and the company s operating results will be adversely affected 
risks relating to the company s products because the market for turbochef s products is an emerging market  the company will be required to undertake significant marketing efforts to achieve market acceptance  the success of which can not be predicted 
the rapid cook commercial oven segment of the food service equipment industry is an emerging market 
as is typical with new products based on innovative technologies  demand for and market acceptance of the turbochef ovens are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
achieving market acceptance for the turbochef ovens will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds to increase the food service industry s familiarity with turbochef and to educate potential customers as to the distinctive characteristics and perceived benefits of the turbochef ovens and its technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company will have available the funds necessary to achieve such acceptance or that the company s efforts will result in significant commercial acceptance 
if the company s marketing strategy is not successful  the company will incur significant expenses and its operating results will be adversely affected 
historically  turbochef has engaged a limited direct sales force 
the company intends to incur significant expense to expand its direct sales force 
if the company s efforts are unsuccessful or its direct sales force is unable to generate significant additional revenue  the company will incur significant cash expenditures  without achieving a corresponding increase in revenues  which will adversely affect the company s operating results and future prospects 
the company is subject to risks associated with developing products based on innovative technologies  which could delay product introductions and result in significant capital expenditures 
the company continually seeks to refine and improve upon the physical attributes  utility and performance of the turbochef oven 
moreover  the company is subject to many risks associated with the development of new products based on innovative technologies  including unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of the funds allocated for the completion of such development  which could result in a substantial change in the design  delay in the development  or abandonment of new applications and products 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the company will develop or successfully commercialize ovens incorporating technology superior to that contained in its c oven technology or that additional products will be successfully developed or that if developed they will meet current price or performance objectives  be developed on a timely basis or prove to be as effective as products based on other technologies 
the inability to successfully complete development of a product or application or a determination by the company  for financial  technical or other reasons  not to complete development of any product or application  particularly in instances in which we have made significant capital expenditures  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and operations 
the nature of the company s business exposes the company to potential liability 
the company are engaged in a business which could expose it to possible liability claims from others  including from food service operators and their staffs  as well as from consumers  for personal injury or property damage due to design or manufacturing defects or otherwise 
there can be no assurance that the company s insurance or that of any third party manufacturer will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that an adequate level of coverage will be available in the future at reasonable cost 
a partially insured or a completely uninsured successful claim against the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and future operations and prospects 
there can be no assurance that future warranty expenses will not have an adverse effect on the company 
risks relating to the company s relationships with third parties the company has committed to purchase approximately million of c ovens from the company s sole manufacturing source  regardless of whether the company has customers for these ovens 
in march  the company entered into a manufacturing agreement with shandong xiaoya group xiaoya pursuant to which the company is committed to purchase million of c ovens over the next months 
the company is committed to purchase these ovens  regardless of whether the company has made corresponding sales 
if sales of ovens do not increase significantly  the company will be forced to acquire excess inventory and may not have the funds necessary to make the purchases required under the agreement 
if the company were to breach the agreement xiaoya could terminate the agreement and seek monetary damages 
moreover  xiaoya is the company s sole supplier of c ovens 
if xiaoya were unable to produce ovens  in accordance with the company s scheduled delivery requirements and its quality specifications  the company s ability to generate sales will be materially impacted 
the company is dependent upon third party suppliers and manufacturers and do not control their activities 
the company generally does not maintain supply agreements with such third parties but instead purchases components and electronic parts pursuant to purchase orders in the ordinary course of business 
some of the company s specially designed components used in the company s oven are sourced from a limited number of suppliers 
turbochef is and will continue to be substantially dependent on the ability of the company s suppliers to  among other things  meet the company s design  performance and quality specifications 
their failure to supply  or delay in supplying the company with ovens or components could adversely affect the company s profit margin and its ability to meet its delivery schedules on a timely and competitive basis 
the company is subject to the risks and uncertainties of foreign manufacturing which could interrupt the company s operations 
all of the company s products are manufactured in china 
the company is subject to various risks inherent in foreign manufacturing  including 
increased credit risks  
tariffs  duties and other trade barriers  
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  
shipping delays  and 
international political  regulatory and economic developments 
any of these developments could have a significant impact on the company s manufacturer s ability to deliver the company s products  increase the company s costs of goods and or interrupt its operations 
if these goods were destroyed or damaged during shipment  turbochef could lose sales opportunities and its operations and financial position could be adversely affected 
risks relating to the company s technologies and intellectual property if turbochef is unable to protect its patents  trademarks and other intellectual property  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance as to the breadth or degree of protection which existing or future patents  if any  may afford the company  that any patent applications will result in issued patents  that the company s patents  pending patents  registered trademark or registered servicemark will be upheld if challenged or that competitors will not develop similar or superior methods or products outside the protection of any patent issued to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will have all of the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary know how and employs various methods to protect the concepts  ideas and documentation of its proprietary technologies 
however  those methods may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar know how or obtain access to the company s know how  concepts  ideas and documentation 
furthermore  although the company has and expects to have confidentiality and non competition agreements with its employees and appropriate suppliers and manufacturers  there can be no assurance that these arrangements will adequately protect the company s trade secrets or that others will not independently develop products or technologies similar to the company s 
if turbochef s products or intellectual property violates the rights of others  the company may become liable for damages 
in the event the company s existing or any future products  trademarks  servicemarks  other proprietary rights infringe patents  trademarks  servicemarks or proprietary rights of others  the company could become liable for damages and may be required to modify the design of its products  change the name of its products or obtain a license 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions  or at all 
the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon the company s ability to manufacture and market its products 
if the company is unable to keep up with changing technology and evolving industry standards  the company s products may become obsolete 
the market for the company s products and technologies is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards 
the company will not be able to compete successfully unless it continually enhances and improves its existing products  completes development and introduces to the marketplace in a timely manner the company s proposed products  adapts its products to the needs of the company s customers and potential customers and evolving industry standards  and continues to improve operating efficiencies and lowers manufacturing costs 
moreover  competitors may develop technologies or products that render the company s products obsolete or less marketable 
other risks because of the intense competition in the market in which the company competes and the strength of some of its competitors  the company may not be able to compete effectively 
the rapid cook segment of the food service equipment market is characterized by intense competition 
the company competes with numerous well established manufacturers and suppliers of commercial ovens  grills and fryers including those which cook through the use of conduction  convection  induction  air impingement  infrared  and or microwave heating methods 
in addition  the company is aware of others who are developing  and in some cases have introduced  new ovens based on high speed heating methods and technologies 
there can be no assurance that other companies with the financial resources and expertise that would encourage them to attempt to develop competitive products  do not have or are not currently developing functionally equivalent products  or that functionally equivalent products will not become available in the near future 
most of the company s competitors possess substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than the company and have established reputations relating to product design  development  manufacture  marketing and service of cooking equipment 
turbochef s business subjects it to significant regulatory compliance burdens 
the company is subject to regulations administered by various federal  state  local and international authorities  including those limiting radiated emissions from oven products  which impose significant compliance burdens on us 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements may subject the company to civil and criminal sanctions and penalties 
while the company believes that the company and its products are in compliance in all material respects with all laws and regulations applicable to such models  including those administered by the united states food and drug administration  the federal communications commission  the european community council and the japanese government s ministry of international trade there can be no assurance of such compliance 
moreover  new legislation and regulations  as well as revisions to existing laws and regulations  at the federal  state  local and international levels may be proposed in the future affecting the foodservice equipment industry 
these proposals could affect the company s operations  result in material capital expenditures  affect the marketability of our existing products and technologies and or could limit opportunities for the company with respect to modifications of our existing products or with respect to the company s new or proposed products or technologies 
in addition  expansion of the company s operations into new markets may require it to comply with additional regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to comply with additional applicable laws and regulations without excessive cost or business interruption  and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is subject to the risk of financial loss from foreign currency fluctuations 
approximately of the company s revenues are derived from sales outside of the united states 
these sales  as well as salaries of employees located outside of the united states and approximately of the company s other expenses  are denominated in foreign currencies  including british pounds and the euro 
the company is subject to risk of financial loss resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates of these currencies against the us dollar 
the company is involved in an arbitration proceeding which  if the outcome were unfavorable  would adversely affect the company s operating results and future operations 
the company is a plaintiff in an arbitration proceeding commenced in against its former strategic partner  the maytag corporation
