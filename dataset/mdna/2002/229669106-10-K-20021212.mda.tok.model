fiscal compared to fiscal the company s net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of percent over fiscal  representing the highest sales in the company s history 
net income grew percent to million  or per share  also a record high for the company 
while some of this increase can be attributed to a change in accounting for goodwill of million  after taxes  and a one time tax benefit of million  operating profits increased in both major segments  most significantly in defense 
defense segment as depicted in the following chart  defense segment sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an percent increase 
this increase was from growth in the company s existing defense training and service businesses 
the most significant growth came from a percent increase in the service businesses as the company won new battlefield simulation and operation and maintenance contracts 
training systems sales increased percent for the year from new miles contracts and strong sales of both air and ground combat training systems 
sales of communications systems decreased by percent from last year due to certain products  which may be nearing the end of their life cycle 
however  the company has developed new or enhanced communications products in the past year which it believes will generate growth opportunities for this business in the coming years 
years ended september  in millions defense segment sales communications and electronics training systems government services defense segment operating profits communications and electronics training systems government services goodwill amortization as the foregoing operating profit analysis indicates  operating profits in the defense segment more than doubled from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the biggest improvements came from training systems  with the miles product line generating a profit for the first time due to new contract awards received in and and due to the combat training range business improving from an operating loss in to an operating profit in growth of the service businesses generated increased operating profits proportionate to the increase in sales 
operating profits in communications were down primarily due to lower profit margins in the company s surveillance receiver product line 
operating profits for the segment were also increased by the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
this year  which required the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
had this pronouncement been in effect last year  operating profits for the segment would have been higher by approximately million in fiscal transportation systems segment transportation segment sales increased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal like the defense business  this increase was the result of internally generated growth due to new contract awards in recent years 
the north american market generated significant new business for the company  while the european market has remained strong  especially in the united kingdom 
the company has turned its attention primarily to these markets as business in the far east has declined and opportunities there appear to be limited in the near term 
during the year the company acquired a new facility south of london  england  in order to gain greater efficiency by bringing administrative and engineering operations in the region together into one facility 
this new building is currently being outfitted and is expected to be occupied by january in connection with this consolidation of operations  the company recorded a provision of million in the first quarter of fiscal for severance costs related to the planned closing of a facility in western england 
the facility was closed and the total amount provided was expended by september  operating profits in the transportation systems segment improved primarily due to the growth in north american revenues and due to the discontinuance of goodwill amortization  as described above 
had the new accounting rules been in effect last year  operating profits for the segment would have been higher by approximately million in fiscal the growth in operating profits in fiscal was limited somewhat due to the severance costs mentioned above and by legal costs incurred in connection with the company s dispute of a contract tender in australia 
the prestige contract in london has progressed well during the year and the company has met all of its major milestones 
nearly all equipment has been installed and the system is functioning well 
certain less critical milestones have been moved to fiscal by mutual agreement with the customer 
these changes resulted from failure of a certain subcontractor to perform 
consequently  the company was forced to terminate this subcontractor and is completing the subcontractor s work 
the company will incur additional costs to complete this work and is in the process of preparing a claim against the subcontractor to recover the costs 
this situation has resulted in the company realizing lower profit margins to date than had previously been anticipated  and could limit increases in future profit margins and cash flows from the contract until the situation is resolved 
while the company believes the factual basis for its claim is very strong  recovery has not been anticipated in the calculation of operating profits  because the amount of ultimate claim recovery cannot be determined at this point and  in accordance with criteria set forth in aicpa statement of position  cannot be recorded as an asset 
general the growth in net income in fiscal was partially due to a tax benefit of million and a required change in accounting for goodwill  which added another million  after taxes 
partially offsetting these items in fiscal were charges related to facility closing costs in the united kingdom of million  after taxes 
in addition  fiscal had included a nonrecurring gain of million  after taxes  from the sale of marketable securities 
excluding these non recurring items in both years  earnings increased by approximately percent  as follows amounts are presented after the effects of income taxes in millions earnings before nonrecurring items tax benefit facility closing costs goodwill amortization gain on sale of securities net income cost of sales improved to percent of sales in fiscal from percent in fiscal due to improved margins in the defense segment 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses grew by million from to  increasing from percent of sales to percent of sales 
the increase in sg a spending occurred in both segments as selling activities in pursuit of new business opportunities increased 
the defense segment increase came from an increase in proposal activity for potential new contracts  while the transportation segment increased its marketing efforts in europe 
in addition  the transportation segment incurred legal costs in connection with the company s dispute of a contract tender in australia and provided for facility closing costs related to the facilities in england 
income tax expense for the year ended september  was unusually low  at about percent of pre tax income  due to a million tax benefit realized from the company s subsidiary in denmark 
the company was able to utilize a net operating loss carryforward through the sale of this business to another foreign subsidiary of the company 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the danish tax authorities approved the transaction and the liquidation of the subsidiary  resulting in the realization of the associated deferred tax asset 
without this nonrecurring item  income tax expense would have been approximately percent of pre tax income 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
as allowed by early adoption provisions  the company began applying the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets effective october  if the new rules had been in effect during the years ended september  and  net income would have been higher in those years by approximately million 
per share and million 
per share respectively 
as of september  and there was no impairment of the goodwill balance 
fluctuation in the goodwill balance between september  and reflects the effects of foreign currency translation on goodwill balances carried on the books of foreign subsidiaries 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas establishes a single model to account for impairment of assets to be held or disposed  incorporating guidelines for accounting and disclosure of discontinued operations 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally  its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
the company adopted this new standard effective october  and there was no impact on the financial statements of the company at that date 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
the principal effect of applying fas will be on the timing of recognition of these costs 
had the statement been in effect during fiscal  the impact on the company s financial statements would have been immaterial 
the new standard is effective as of december  and will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after that date 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal the company realized significant profit improvements in both major segments of the business  despite somewhat lower sales than in fiscal transportation segment sales were lower by about percent due to delays in new contract awards  customer requested production delays in san francisco  and anticipated revenue declines in london and new york 
in spite of the decreased transportation sales volume in fiscal  improved profit margins resulted in higher profits from this segment 
management s assessment was that margins in the segment had improved due to the maturity of its customer base and the substantial completion of several contracts with lower profit margins 
defense segment sales grew by nearly percent in fiscal  with the most significant growth coming from its data link product line  which increased sales to the united kingdom and us governments during in addition  acquisitions made in fiscal contributed to higher sales  as well as continued growth in defense related service activities  including the computerized battlefield simulation and operations and maintenance businesses 
the growth from these products and services more than offset a decrease in revenues from the miles contract with the us government  which was nearing completion 
the company was awarded contracts for additional miles work during operating profits in the defense segment improved significantly from the loss incurred in fiscal increased sales volume from data links and the computerized battlefield simulation business resulted in higher operating profits from those product lines 
however  the most significant improvement from to was due to the loss provision for the miles contract recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal not being repeated in fiscal competition for combat training systems contracts continued to be substantial  resulting in low profit margins from this business area in recent years 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the high ratio in was caused by the loss provision recorded on the miles contract 
the fiscal ratio also represents improvement from percent in fiscal  resulting from higher profit margins in the transportation segment during fiscal year  as described above 
sg a expenses were virtually unchanged from to  but increased to percent of sales in fiscal from percent of sales in fiscal sg a expenses increased in the defense segment in proportion to the increase in sales 
although the transportation segment reduced sg a spending slightly  the reductions were not as significant as the decrease in sales volume  primarily due to increased selling and proposal spending in pursuit of transportation systems opportunities 
financial position and liquidity cash flows from operations were positive for the fourth consecutive year as positive cash flows from the defense segment offset somewhat negative cash flows in the transportation segment 
one particular transportation systems contract generated negative cash flows of nearly million during the year  due to unfavorable contractual payment terms provided to the customer in a competitive situation 
this caused growth in the unbilled long term contract accounts receivable balance during the year  however  management expects that all of the equipment will be accepted by the customer in fiscal and that all outstanding amounts from this customer will be collected prior to september  cash was used to invest in the new building in the united kingdom  as described above  for normal replacement of capital equipment  and to pay dividends to shareholders 
the company s net deferred tax asset was million at september  compared to million at september  of these amounts  million and million at september  and respectively  resulted from the tax effect of recording the additional minimum pension liability  as described below 
it is expected that the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the company recorded a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million and million  net of applicable income taxes of million and million  in the years ended september  and  respectively  due to growth in the accumulated benefit obligation and the decline in market value of assets in its defined benefit pension plans 
pension accounting rules require that a minimum liability be recorded for the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation over the net assets of the plan  resulting in this charge to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the increase in accumulated benefit obligation can be attributed primarily to a drop in interest rates  which the company expects will be a short term situation 
in addition  the company believes that the decline in the value of pension plan assets is also temporary  as it resulted from the steep decline in the stock market during the past two years 
over the long term the company s pension assets have performed at or above the level of the assumed rate of return used for the calculation of pension expense and the company expects that this will continue in the future 
the current under funded situation will result in an increase to the minimum funding requirement for fiscal and  therefore  an increase in company contributions to the plans of million for the year 
at september  the company had working capital of million and a current ratio of to the company expects that cash on hand and its unused debt capacity will be adequate to meet its short and long term financing needs 
funded backlog at september  was  compared to  at september  total backlog  including un funded or un exercised customer orders  was  at september  compared to  at september  critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition  costs to complete contracts  pension costs  valuation of goodwill and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
eventual results may differ from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company invests in money market instruments and short term marketable debt and equity securities that are tied to floating interest rates being offered at the time the investment is made 
the company maintains a short term borrowing arrangement in the united kingdom uk  which is also tied to a floating interest rate the uk base rate 
the company also has senior unsecured notes payable to insurance companies that are due in annual installments 
these notes have fixed coupon interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest income earned on the company s short term investments is affected by changes in the general level of us and us interest rates 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
interest expense incurred under the short term borrowing arrangement is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the uk the expense related to these cost streams is usually not hedged since it is either revolving  payable within three months and or immediately callable by the lender at any time 
interest expense incurred under the long term notes payable is not affected by changes in any interest rate because it is fixed 
however  the company has in the past  and may in the future  use an interest rate swap to essentially convert this fixed rate into a floating rate for some or all of the long term debt outstanding 
the purpose of a swap is to tie the interest expense risk related to these borrowings to the interest income risk on the company s short term investments  thereby mitigating the company s net interest rate risk 
the company believes that it is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this point in time 
there was no interest rate swap outstanding at september  foreign currency exchange risk in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into firm sale and purchase commitments denominated in many foreign currencies 
the company has a policy to hedge those commitments greater than  by using foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary responsible for the commitment  typically the british pound  euro  singapore dollar and australian dollar 
these contracts are designed to be effective hedges regardless of the direction or magnitude of any foreign currency exchange rate change because they result in an equal and opposite income or cost stream that offsets the change in the value of the underlying commitment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s foreign currency translation and transaction accounting policies 
the company also uses balance sheet hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
this strategy involves incurring british pound denominated debt see interest rate risk above  and having the option of paying off the debt using us dollar or british pound funds 
the company believes that it is not significantly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk at this point in time 
the company s investments in its foreign subsidiaries in the uk  australia  new zealand and singapore are not hedged because they are considered to be invested indefinitely 
in addition  the company generally has control over the timing and amount of earnings repatriation and expects to use this control to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk
