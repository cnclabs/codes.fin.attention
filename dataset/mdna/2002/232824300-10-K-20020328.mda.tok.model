the company s capital and operating requirements may change depending upon various factors  including i whether the company and its strategic partners achieve success in manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of its products  ii the amount of resources which the company devotes to clinical evaluations and the expansion of marketing and sales capabilities  iii results of clinical trials and research and development activities  and iv competitive and technological developments  in particular  the company expects to incur significant costs for the development of its proteomics and psma technologies 
the company s financial objectives are to meet its capital and operating requirements through revenues from existing products and licensing arrangements

however  management believes that  if successful  such strategies may increase long term revenues 
there can be no assurance as to the success of such strategies or that resulting funds will be sufficient to meet cash requirements until product revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses  if ever

the company expects that it will have additional requirements for debt or equity capital  irrespective of whether and when it reaches profitability  for further product development costs  product and technology acquisition costs  and working capital 
the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including the successful commercialization of its products  the costs associated with the acquisition of complementary products and technologies  progress in its product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with clinical trials  progress with regulatory affairs activities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the expansion of strategic alliances for the sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of its products 
to the extent that the currently available funds and revenues are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
there can be no assurance that the financial sources described above will be available when needed or at terms commercially acceptable to the company 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  further scale back or eliminate certain aspects of its operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  financial reporting release no 
was recently released by the securities and exchange commission to require all companies to include a discussion to address  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment 
we do not grant price protection to customers 
quadramet royalties are recognized when earned 
the securities and exchange commission has issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the recognition of up front  non refundable license fees 
accordingly  we defer up front license fees and recognize them over the estimated performance period of the related agreement 
since the term of the performance periods is subject to management s estimates  future revenues to be recognized could be affected by changes in such estimates 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances are net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for uncollectibe accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts if our future bad debt expense exceeds our estimated reserve 
we are subject to concentration risks as a limited number of our customers provide a high percent of total revenues  and corresponding receivables 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  as determined using the first in  first out method  which most closely reflects the physical flow of our inventories 
our products and raw materials are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly review quantities on hand to determine the need for reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of our product sales 
our estimate of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
carrying value of fixed and intangible assets our fixed assets and certain of our acquired rights to market our products have been recorded at cost and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life those assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
adverse changes regarding future cash flows to be received from long lived assets could indicate that an impairment exists  and would require the write down of the carrying value of the impaired asset at that time 
commitments as outlined in note  and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  less than to to after contractual obligation year years years years total long term debt    capital lease obligations    facility leases     other operating leases    research and development contracts      minimum royalty payments      in addition to the above  we are obligated to make certain royalty payments based on sales of the related product
