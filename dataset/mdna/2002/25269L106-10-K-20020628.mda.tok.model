item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a premier global management consulting firm 
we help leading organizations worldwide develop and implement growth strategies  improve operations  and capitalize on technology 
we work collaboratively with our clients  utilizing teams of consultants with skills in strategy  technology and program management 
during fiscal year we generated million of net revenues before reimbursements of out of pocket expenses from clients 
as of march   we employed client serving professionals and had twelve offices in north america  europe and latin america 
we regularly review our fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that our services and compensation are competitive within the industry  and that our overhead costs are balanced with our revenue level 
in addition  we monitor the progress of client projects with client senior management 
we manage the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements for new engagements 
however  a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned 
in addition  because most of our client engagements are terminable by our clients without penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require us to maintain underutilized employees 
while professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements  we must also maintain a sufficient number of senior professionals to oversee existing client engagements and participate in our sales efforts to secure new client assignments 
in november  the fasb issued a staff announcement regarding the income statement classification of out of pocket expenses incurred and billed to clients for reimbursement 
this announcement requires that out of pocket expenses incurred and billed to clients for reimbursement be reflected in the income statement on a gross basis as both revenue and expense 
accordingly  we have adjusted revenue and project costs for all periods reported to include out of pocket expenses 
we have also adjusted revenue and project costs for all periods reported to include administrative charges billed to clients 
previously  these out of pocket expense reimbursements and administrative charges billed to clients were classified as a reduction of project personnel and related expenses 
this change in classification had no effect on current or previously reported net income loss or earnings loss per share 
forward looking statements statements contained anywhere in this report that are not historical facts contain forward looking statements including such statements identified by the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect and similar terminology used with respect to the company and its management

the forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update them to reflect events or circumstances that arise in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and 
table of contents assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we earn revenues from a range of consulting services  including helping organizations worldwide to develop and implement growth strategies  improve operations  and capitalize on technology 
our revenues are comprised of professional fees for services rendered to our clients plus reimbursement of out of pocket expenses 
prior to the commencement of a client engagement  we and our client agree on fees for services based upon the scope of the project  our staffing requirements and the level of client involvement 
we recognize revenue as services are performed in accordance with the terms of the client engagement 
service revenue recognition inherently involves a degree of estimation 
examples of important estimates in this area include determining the level of effort required to execute the project  calculating costs incurred and assessing our progress toward project completion on an ongoing basis 
we utilize a number of management processes to monitor project performance and revenue recognition including monthly reviews of the progress of each project against plan  staff and resource usage  service quality and client feedback 
from time to time  as part of our normal management process  circumstances are identified that require us to revise our estimates of the revenues to be realized on a project 
in most cases  these revisions relate to changes in the scope of the project  and do not significantly impact the expected fees on a contract 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects revenue previously recognized  we record the full effect of the revision in the period when the underlying facts become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred revenue we earn our revenues by providing consulting services to clients 
we bill our clients for these services on either a monthly or semi monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the client engagement 
accordingly  we recognize amounts due from our clients as the related services are rendered and revenue is earned even though we may not be able to bill for those services until a later date 
the terms of our client engagements also require us to assume the risk of non collection of amounts billed to clients 
management makes estimates of the amount of our billed and unbilled accounts receivable that may not be collected from clients 
in making these estimates  management specifically analyzes individual client balances  the composition of the aging of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends  and considers our overall experience with estimating uncollectible amounts 
we recognize the effect of changes in our estimates  assumptions and assessments of the factors impacting the collectibility of amounts due from customers on an ongoing basis 
as of march   our accounts receivable balance was million  including unbilled accounts receivable of million  and net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
unbilled receivables represent revenues earned for services performed that have not been billed 
unbilled receivables are typically billed the following month 
although we and our clients agree on the scope of projects  expected deliverables and related fees in advance  from time to time we have made revisions to the scope of work and deliverables without making a corresponding adjustment to the fees for the project 
we refer to this as project run on as these revisions generally cause a project to extend beyond its targeted completion 
we monitor our actual project run on experience on an ongoing basis and perform monthly reviews of projects in progress against plan 
we provide for project run on costs based on our analysis of historical experience 
these provisions  net of actual costs incurred on completed projects  are reflected in deferred revenue 
as of march   our deferred revenue balance was million 
while we have been required to make revisions to our clients estimated deliverables and to incur additional project costs in some instances  to date there have been no such revisions that have had a material adverse effect on our operating results 

table of contents operating expenses the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel expenses consist of payroll costs and related benefits associated with professional staff 
other direct costs include travel  subcontracting  third party vendor payments and unbillable costs associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
the amount of these other direct costs can vary substantially from period to period depending largely on revenue 
however  project personnel and related expenses are relatively fixed in nature  and declines in revenue will often result in reduced utilization of professional personnel and lower operating margins 
the remainder of our recurring operating expenses are comprised of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  and management and administrative support 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with our development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations  finance  information systems  facilities  including the rent of office space  and other administrative support for project personnel 
in december  we recorded a restructuring charge related to specific actions we took to better align our cost infrastructure with our near term revenue expectations 
the charge included estimates of costs related to severance and other personnel related expenses  as well as costs related to reductions in office space  the write off of associated leasehold improvements  and the establishment of accruals for other contractual commitments which are not expected to provide future benefit 
we estimated these costs based upon our restructuring plan 
although we do not expect there to be significant changes to our plan  changes may be necessary due to unanticipated events  and may result in revisions to previously recorded estimates 
such revisions will be reflected in the financial statements in the period they occur 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill in fiscal  we amortized goodwill over its estimated period of benefit and assessed the carrying value of our long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the recorded amount may not be recoverable  as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
our goodwill was recognized in connection with acquisitions we made in fiscal and the majority of our goodwill relates to our acquisition of cluster telecom bv  a pan european consulting firm specializing in wireless technology and digital strategies  which occurred in november all of the skills we acquired in these transactions continue to be important to our service delivery 
additionally  diversifying our business across geographies and expanding into new markets are key elements to our business strategy 
our ability to implement this portion of our strategy has been significantly enhanced by cluster s strong presence in europe and latin america 
in applying existing accounting literature related to the valuation and amortization of long lived assets including goodwill  management must make estimates of the period of benefit or use of the assets and judgments about whether particular events or developing circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we estimate the lives of our long term assets  including goodwill  at the time they are acquired based on their expected period of benefit or use 
factors we consider in establishing these lives include the nature of the asset  our prior experience with similar assets  and expected future cash flows from use of the asset 
we revise our estimates as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and to recognize the effects of obsolescence  competition and changes in economic conditions 

table of contents we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  including goodwill  whenever events or circumstances suggest the balance might not be recovered 
we use judgment to determine when such a review is necessary 
we base our judgments  about whether an impairment review is required  on factors such as our operating performance and our projections of future results  the importance of the acquired assets to our business strategy  industry or economic trends and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
based on our assessment of these factors  together with the recent timing of our acquisitions  and our judgment that the current downturn in our industry was not likely to be permanent  we concluded that no impairment review was required at march  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million as of march  if we had determined that an impairment review was required  we would have measured any impairment based on estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition as required by sfas in fiscal  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets will be effective for the company  and establishes new standards for accounting for and assessing the impairment of goodwill 
as a result  the company will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill beginning on april  approximately million of amortization related to goodwill was recognized during fiscal 
in lieu of amortization  sfas no 
requires us to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill as of april  thereafter  we will be required to perform an impairment review at least annually and upon the identification of certain indicators of possible impairment of value such as those outlined above 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level  using a discounted cash flow method 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
while we have not as yet completed the full evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill required by the new criteria under sfas no 
 we expect to record a non cash cumulative effect charge of between million and million during the first quarter of fiscal year to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
new accounting policies on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
business combinations accounted for as poolings of interests and initiated prior to june  are grandfathered 
sfas no 
replaces the requirement to amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill with a requirement for an impairment test 
sfas no 
also requires an evaluation of intangible assets and their useful lives and a transitional impairment test for goodwill and certain intangible assets upon adoption 
after transition  the impairment test will be performed annually 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective july  sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and must be applied as of the beginning of a fiscal year 
the company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s consolidated financial statements  and expects to record a non cash cumulative effect charge of between million and million during the first quarter of fiscal year related to the adoption of sfas no 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s consolidated financial statements  however  the company does not expect a material impact on the financial statements as a result of this adoption

in addition  we could consider seeking additional public or private debt or equity financing to fund future growth opportunities  although there is no assurance that such financing would be available to us on acceptable terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sensitive instruments 
foreign currency risk international revenues are generated primarily from our services in the respective countries by our foreign subsidiaries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country  most of which are tied to the euro 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the financial statements of our non us businesses are typically denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
as a result  we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates fluctuate  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected results and profitability 
the company has entered into transactions to reduce the effect of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses on recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  and to reduce the effect of foreign exchange translation gains and losses on the parent company s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries 
these transactions involve the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in certain european currencies 
a forward foreign exchange contract obligates the company to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
as a result  increases or decreases in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency transactions are partially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate the possibility of significant foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses 
the company does not use foreign currency contracts for trading purposes 
the company does not currently hedge anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses 
all foreign currency transactions and outstanding forward contracts are marked to market on a monthly basis 
interest rate risk the company invests its cash in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 
the interest rate risk associated with our investing activities at march  is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings
