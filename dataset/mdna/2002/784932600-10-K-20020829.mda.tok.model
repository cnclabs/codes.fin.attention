item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of human capital development and management infrastructure software and services 
our software solutions are designed to enable businesses and governments to increase performance by automating the processes necessary to develop and manage the people  or human capital  that comprise their extended enterprise of employees  customers  partners and suppliers 
our offerings are designed to increase the return to the organization on their investment in human capital by cost effectively meeting the learning and performance management needs of enterprises across geographies and industries 
our solutions provide information and business processes that empower managers to more tightly align organizational capabilities with desired business outcomes 
general we commenced operations in april and  through march  focused substantially all of our efforts on research activities  developing our products and building our business infrastructure 
we shipped our first saba learning products and began to generate revenues from software license fees  implementation and consulting services fees and support fees in april we began to operate saba exchange in december and our application service provider asp edition of saba learning in september  and first shipped our limited release version of saba performance in may to date  we have not generated significant revenues from saba exchange  saba learning asp edition or saba performance 
sources of revenues and revenue recognition to date  we have generated revenues primarily from licensing saba learning enterprise edition  and providing related services  including implementation  consulting  support  hosting and education 
our revenues reflect billed expenses as revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
previously we recorded billed expenses as a reduction to cost of services to offset the related cost incurred 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  as amended  we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of these fees is probable 
sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
revenue recognized from multiple element arrangements is allocated to undelivered elements of the arrangement  such as support services  based on the relative fair values of the elements 
our determination of fair value of each element in multi element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
prior to november   we had not established vsoe of fair value for our support services 
accordingly  we recognized the revenue generated from these multiple element arrangements ratably over the period during which the support services were provided  which was generally months 
a substantial majority of our licenses entered into from november  to august  included rights to unspecified additional platform versions of our software  extended payment terms and or services essential to the functionality of the software 
for licenses that included rights to unspecified additional platform versions  we recognized license revenues ratably over the period during which we were required to provide the additional platform versions beginning in the month when all other revenue recognition criteria had been met 
revenue from contracts with extended payment terms are recognized at the lesser of amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee otherwise recognizable 
for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services essential to the functionality of the software  the license and services revenues are recognized over the service delivery period using the percentage of completion method 
we use labor hours incurred as a percentage of total expected hours as the measure of progress towards completion 
a substantial majority of our licenses entered into after august  do not provide for unspecified additional platform versions  extended payment terms or service essential to the functionality of the software 
revenues derived from these licenses are recognized on delivery if the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
revenues from our application service provider offering and from our hosting services are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the support term  typically months  and revenue related to implementation  consulting  education and other services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
although we primarily provide implementation and consulting services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services has been provided on a fixed fee basis 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues includes cost of our license revenues and cost of our services revenues 
our cost of license revenues includes the cost of manuals and product documentation  production media  shipping costs and royalties to third parties 
our cost of services revenues includes salaries and related expenses for our professional services organization  as well as third party hosting costs 
because our cost of services revenues is greater than cost of license revenues  cost of total revenues as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate based on the mix of products and services sold 
operating expenses our operating expenses are classified into three general operational categories research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative 
in addition  our operating expenses include amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges  and amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we classify all charges  except stock compensation and other stock charges  to the research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of the expenses 
each of these three categories includes commonly recurring expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  and allocated communication  rent and depreciation costs 
we allocate these expenses to each of the functional areas that derive a benefit from such expenses based upon their respective headcounts 
the sales and marketing category of operating expenses also includes sales commissions and expenses related to public relations and advertising  trade shows and marketing collateral materials 
the general and administrative category of operating expenses also includes allowances for doubtful accounts and administrative and professional services fees 
in connection with the granting of stock options to  and restricted stock purchases by  our employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling approximately million 
these charges were recorded during fiscal and and reduced in fiscal and as a result of cancellation of stock options resulting from employee attrition and reductions in workforce 
this amount represents the difference between the exercise or purchase price  as applicable  and the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial accounting purposes on the date these stock options were granted or purchase agreements for restricted stock were signed 
during the year ended may   we also recorded deferred stock compensation of million for the intrinsic value of stock subject to repurchase assumed by us in connection with the acquisition of ultris inc these amounts are included as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period of the restricted stock using the graded vesting method 
the amortization of the remaining deferred stock compensation will result in additional charges to operations through fiscal our march acquisition of human performance technologies  inc resulted in purchased intangible assets of million 
these assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of six months to three years 
our june acquisition of ultris inc resulted in goodwill and purchased intangible assets of million 
the intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of six months to three years 
prior to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on june   goodwill was being amortized over its estimated useful life of three years 
the net value of goodwill on june  will cease to be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
history of losses we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
as of may   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will be able to realize sufficient revenues to achieve or  once achieved  sustain profitability 
while we have in the recent past and may from time to time in the future reduce operating expenses in response to the downturns in the united states or international economies  we generally expect to incur significantly greater operating expenses in the future 
we also expect to incur substantial non cash expenses relating to stock compensation  amortization of purchased intangible assets and any potential goodwill impairment 
we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to achieve profitability 
if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain it 
we had full time employees as of may  despite recent reductions in staffing  we have generally experienced periods of significant expansion of operations that have placed significant demands on our management and operational resources 
to manage the future growth of our operations and personnel  we must continue to invest in scalable operational systems  procedures and controls 
we must also be able to recruit qualified candidates to manage our expanding operations 
we expect future expansion to continue to challenge our ability to hire  train  manage and retain our employees 
limited operating history we have a limited operating history that makes it difficult to forecast our future operating results 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  such as human capital development and management  electronic commerce and internet software 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
although we have experienced significant growth in revenues in prior periods  we do not believe that these growth rates are indicative of our future operating results 
results of operations years ended may   and revenues total revenues in fiscal increased to million  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the modest increase in total revenues in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in license revenues 
the growth in revenues in fiscal over fiscal reflects our relatively early stage of development and is primarily attributable to our expanded sales force and international presence 
as a percentage of total revenues  revenues from customers outside the united states represented in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  and  no customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
license revenues in fiscal increased to million  or of total revenues  from million in fiscal  or of total revenues  and million in fiscal  or of total revenues 
in fiscal  fewer software licenses included provisions for future deliverables and  as a result  substantially more license revenues were recognized upon delivery in fiscal than in fiscal therefore  license revenues in fiscal increased over the prior fiscal year despite a decline in new software agreements 
we believe this decline in new software agreements was primarily attributable to the rapid and increasingly severe downturn in the united states economy  which was further stalled by terrorist attacks in september the increase in license revenues in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to increases in sales of licenses to new customers and  to a lesser extent  deferred revenue from existing contracts 
services revenues were million in fiscal  or of total revenues  million in fiscal  or of total revenues  and million in fiscal  or of total revenues 
the decrease in services revenues in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to decreased consulting revenues as a result of the decline in new software agreements  which was partially offset by an increase in support and hosting revenues 
the increase in services revenues in fiscal over fiscal is attributable to increased implementation services in connection with increased software agreements  support and education services provided to our new customers and support renewals sold to our increasing installed base 
billed expenses were million in fiscal  or of total revenues  million in fiscal  or of total revenues  and  in fiscal  or of total revenues 
the decrease in billed expenses in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to decreased consulting revenues as a result of the decline in new software agreements 
the increase in billed expenses in fiscal over fiscal is attributable to increased implementation services in connection with an increase in software license agreements with new customers 
the mix of license and services revenues as a percentage of total revenues has varied significantly due to our relatively early stage of development 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to a reduction in services personnel in response to decreased software sales 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal is attributable to the hiring of additional employees to support increased customer demand for our implementation  consulting and support services 
cost of services revenues represented of services revenues for fiscal  of services revenues for fiscal and of services revenues for fiscal the decreases in the cost of services as a percentage of services revenues are primarily attributable to increased utilization of our consultants billable hours as a percent of total hours  as well as an increased average billing rate of our consultants 
reimbursable expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to fewer billable implementation services projects in response to fewer new software agreements 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal is attributable to an increase in billable projects as a result of increased customer demand for our implementation services 
cost of revenues in fiscal includes million of amortization of acquired developed technology from the acquisitions of human performance technologies  inc and ultris inc 
the developed technology of million acquired from human performance technologies  inc is being amortized over a two year estimated useful life and the developed technology of million acquired from ultris inc is being amortized over a three year estimated useful life 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to reduced personnel costs associated with a decrease in research and development personnel in the us and a decrease in the use of third party consultants 
these decreases were partially offset by increased staffing in our lower cost development center in india 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to increases in the average number of employees engaged in research and development 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to reduced personnel costs associated with a decrease in sales and marketing personnel and a reduction in advertising  public relations and other marketing events 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to increases in the number of employees in our sales and marketing organizations and related costs  including increased sales commissions 
in addition  the increase in fiscal is attributable to our brand launch and marketing campaign 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to reduced personnel costs associated with a decrease in general and administrative personnel  as well as a decrease in bad debt expense 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of executive  finance and administrative employees  as well as increases in the bad debt expense due to significant growth in our receivable balances and the amount of administrative and professional services fees  including temporary staffing  legal and accounting fees 
amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges 
amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal included in amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges in fiscal is million related to the post acquisition amortization of the deferred stock compensation for the intrinsic value of common stock subject to repurchase assumed in connection with the acquisition of ultris inc the estimated intrinsic value of the  shares subject to repurchase was approximately million  which is being amortized over the four year repurchase period 
included in amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges in fiscal is million for the issuance of a warrant to a third party and  for stock options granted to non employees 
included in amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges in fiscal is million in other stock charges primarily attributable to the value of stock options granted to non employees 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets was million in fiscal and amortization of purchased intangible assets was  in fiscal the amortization resulted from our march acquisition of human performance technologies  inc and june acquisition of ultris inc 
purchased intangible assets consist of intellectual property  customer base  assembled workforce and noncompetition agreements 
the intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of six months to three years 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
on june   goodwill was being amortized over its estimated useful life of three years 
the net value of goodwill on june  will cease to be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
restructuring charges during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented restructuring programs to reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions 
included in operating expenses are restructuring charges of million for fiscal and million for fiscal the restructuring programs included a worldwide workforce reduction and consolidation of excess facilities 
workforce reduction charges  which consist primarily of severance and fringe benefits  were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the restructuring programs resulted in the reduction of employees in fiscal and employees in fiscal across all business functions and geographic regions 
included in the charges for excess facilities are million in fiscal and  in fiscal relating to non cancelable lease costs partially offset by estimated sub lease income 
also included in fiscal is a charge of  for leasehold improvements and office furniture and fixtures that were no longer used in operations 
amounts related to the lease termination charges will be paid over the respective lease terms through fiscal our estimated costs to exit these facilities are based on available commercial rates 
the actual loss incurred in exiting these facilities could be different from our estimates 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net consists of interest income  interest expense and other non operating expenses 
interest income and other  net was  in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to decreases in short term investments and the decline in short term interest rates during fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to interest income from higher average invested cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  partially offset by interest expense 
provision for income taxes from inception through may   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes 
we recorded income tax expense of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the income tax expense consists entirely of foreign income tax expense incurred as a result of local country profits 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended may  this information has been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of our management  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read this information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we incurred net losses in each quarter since inception and expect to continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future 
you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter  as quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full fiscal year or any other period

our results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if revenues fall below our expectations  we will not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall and operating losses will increase 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience long sales cycles 
therefore  the timing of future customer contracts could be difficult to predict  making it difficult to predict revenues between quarters 
we are subject to employer payroll taxes  both domestic and foreign  on employee exercises of non qualified stock options 
these taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees  measured by the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
we receive domestic tax deductions for gains realized by domestic employees on the exercise of non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recorded as additional paid in capital when realized 
our taxes and cash flows could vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of non qualified stock options exercised by employees in any quarter and  consequently  our results of operations 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include those described below and under the caption factors that may impact future operating results dependence of our revenues on a small number of large orders and the average order value  our ability to attract new customers  any changes in revenue recognition policies and provisions and interpretations of these provisions  our ability to license additional products to current customers  the announcement or introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  changes in the pricing of our products and services or those of our competitors  variability in the mix of our products and services revenues in any quarter  technical difficulties or service interruptions of our computer network systems or the internet generally  and the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business 
recent events in june  we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees 
under this program  employees were given the opportunity until june  to make an election to cancel their outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than per share under the stock incentive plan  as amended or stock incentive plan  in exchange for an equal number of shares to be granted at least six months and one day from the cancellation date at an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant 
those employees who elected to participate in the exchange program were required to exchange all options granted during the six month period prior to the cancellation date 
under this program  options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock were tendered by employees 
the vesting period of each new option will start on the date that the new options are granted and end months after the end of the vesting period stated in the cancelled options 
in no event  however  will the new vesting period exceed four years 
the new options will vest in equal quarterly installments over the vesting period of the new options proportionately adjusted for any partial quarter at the end of the new vesting period 
we will incur compensation expense of  relative to this program for our first quarter ending august  related to cancelled awards 
the exchange program is not expected to result in any additional compensation charges or variable plan accounting 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  through which we have raised net proceeds of million through may   equipment leases and other debt 
as of may   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and outstanding equipment capital leases and note payable of million 
cash used in operating activities was million during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during fiscal cash used in operating activities during fiscal was primarily attributable to a net loss of million  which was partially offset by million in amortization of deferred stock compensation  million in amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and a charge for acquired in process research and development of million

cash used in operating activities during fiscal was primarily attributable to a net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
this was partially offset by million in amortization of deferred stock compensation  an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase in accrued compensation and related expenses of million and an increase in accounts payable of million 
cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to net redemptions and maturities of short term investments of million

cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was mainly attributable to proceeds from the issuance of stock 
as of may   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenses 
our principal commitments consisted of obligations under capital and operating leases 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources  combined with cash flows generated from revenues  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital  capital expense and business expansion requirements for at least the next months 
however  should revenues fall  existing funds may be inadequate 
however  we may choose to raise additional funds within the next months to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the success of our existing and new product and service offerings and competing technological and market developments 
we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at may  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
total capital leases operating leases note payable in thousands fiscal year ending may  thereafter critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the allowance for doubtful accounts and the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are described at the beginning of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which includes the requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the nonamortization approach applies to previously recorded goodwill and to previously recognized intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives  as well as goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets arising from acquisitions completed after the application of sfas no 
in place of amortization  an impairment test must be performed at least annually at the reporting unit level 
any impairment charges on goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset would be presented as a separate line item within the operating section of the statement of operations 
we adopted sfas no 
during our fiscal year beginning june  as such  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of may  in addition  we evaluated our purchased intangible assets and determined that all such assets have determinable lives 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of three years and performed impairment analyses under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
total amortization of goodwill during fiscal was million and our remaining goodwill balance at may  was million 
sfas no 
prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill as of june  we consider saba to be a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
as of june   based on our market capitalization  there was no impairment of goodwill recorded upon implementation of sfas no 
accordingly  the second testing phase was not necessary 
during fiscal  we will also perform the required annual impairment analysis of goodwill  or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate 
any reduction of enterprise fair value below the carrying amount of goodwill could require us to write down the value of goodwill to its fair value and record an expense for the impairment loss 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
 which also includes the criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill  is effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after june  acquisitions subsequent to june  will be accounted for in accordance with this new standard 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires businesses to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
for our fiscal year beginning june  we are currently assessing the impact  if any  of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and accounting principles board no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
also amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
the statement also significantly changes the criteria required to classify an asset as held for sale 
additionally  sfas no 
expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
we adopted sfas no 
for our fiscal year beginning june  we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued staff announcement topic no 
d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which was subsequently incorporated in eitf no 
eitf no 
establishes that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses should be characterized as revenue in the statement of operations 
eitf no 
should be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after december   and comparative financial statements for prior periods should be reclassified 
previously we recorded the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses as a reduction to cost of services to offset the related cost incurred 
while the application of eitf no 
will not result in any impact to operating or net income in any past or future periods  it will reduce gross margins 
we adopted eitf no 
in the quarter ended may  the effect of this adoption was an increase in revenues and cost of revenues of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in eitf no 
was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and could result in us recognizing the cost of future restructuring activities  if any  over a period of time as opposed to as a single event 
factors that may impact future operating results we have a limited operating history and are subject to the risks encountered by early stage companies we were founded in april and shipped our first products in april because we have a limited operating history  you should consider and evaluate our operating prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies in rapidly evolving markets 
for us  these risks include risks that our revenue forecasts may be incorrect because of our limited sales to date and our long sales process  risks associated with our dependence on saba learning enterprise edition  and related services  for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future  risks that our new products  such as saba performance and saba content  will fail to achieve market acceptance  risks that our strategy of establishing saba exchange may not be successful  risks that fluctuations in our quarterly operating results will be significant relative to our revenues  and risks that the current economic downturn will continue to negatively impact the demand for our products and services 
these risks and other risks are described in more detail below 
our future growth will depend substantially on our ability to address these and the other risks described in this section 
if we do not successfully address these risks  our business would be significantly harmed 
we have a history of losses  expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability 
we expect to derive substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future from the licensing of our saba learning enterprise edition and providing related services 
over the longer term  we expect to derive revenues from saba exchange  which is based on an evolving and unproven business model  and new products such as saba learning asp edition  saba performance  which is in limited release  and saba content  and services related to these offerings 
in the future  we expect to continue to incur substantial non cash expenses relating to the amortization of deferred compensation and purchased intangible assets that will contribute to our net losses 
as of may   we had an aggregate of million of deferred stock compensation and million of purchased intangible assets to be amortized 
as a result of all of the foregoing  we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to achieve profitability 
if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain it 
fluctuations of our results could cause our stock price to experience significant fluctuations or declines our operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely fluctuate significantly in the future 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicators of future performance 
our operating expenses are based on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
during fiscal  we took actions to reduce our operating expenses and  while we may from time to time reduce operating expenses in response to downturns in the united states and or international economies  we generally expect to increase our operating expenses to expand our sales and marketing operations  fund greater levels of research and development  develop new alliances  increase our services and support capabilities and improve our operational and financial systems 
if our revenues do not increase along with these expenses  our business would be seriously harmed and net losses in a given quarter would be even larger than expected 
it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenues are especially subject to fluctuations because they depend on the sale of a small number of relatively large orders  principally orders for saba learning enterprise edition and related services 
as a result  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate if we are unable to complete a sufficient number of large orders in any particular quarter 
we have not fully developed our business model for saba exchange  including the structure and amount of the fees we intend to charge 
as this business model evolves  the potential for fluctuations in our quarterly results could increase 
furthermore  our quarterly revenues may be affected significantly by changes in revenue recognition policies and procedures based on changes to or new applicable accounting standards and how these standards are interpreted 
our lengthy sales cycle could cause delays in revenue growth the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the purchase of our products and services is often long 
a customer s decision to purchase our products and services requires the commitment to increase performance through human capital development and management  involves a significant allocation of resources  and is influenced by a customer s budgetary cycles 
to successfully sell our products and services  we generally must educate our potential customers regarding the use and benefits of our products and servies  which can require significant time and resources 
many of our potential customers are large enterprises that generally take longer to make significant business decisions 
our typical sales cycle has been approximately to months 
the delay or failure to complete sales in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general or for one or more large orders  it would adversely affect the timing of our revenues and our revenue growth 
if we were to experience a delay of several weeks on a large order  it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts for a given quarter 
a decline in the price of  or demand for  our main product saba learning enterprise edition or our related service offerings would seriously harm our revenues and operating margins to date  saba learning enterprise edition and related services have accounted for a substantial majority of our revenues 
we anticipate that revenues from our saba learning enterprise edition and related services will continue to constitute a substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
consequently  a decline in the price of  or demand for  saba learning enterprise edition or failure to achieve broad market acceptance would seriously harm our business 
we are exposed to recent unfavorable economic conditions we have seen a rapid and increasingly severe downturn in the united states economy since the first quarter of fiscal  which has been further stalled by terrorist attacks in september there can be no certainty as to the severity or duration of this downturn 
although we cannot predict the extent and timing  if any  of the impact of economic downturns in the united states on economies in other countries or geographic regions  we are seeing an economic slowdown in certain international markets in which we conduct business 
if the economic conditions in the united states continue or worsen or if a global economic slowdown intensifies  the demand for our products and services may be reduced 
not only may these economic slowdowns reduce our customers and prospects budgets for our products and services  but also they may adversely affect our customers ability to pay for our products and services 
accordingly  these economic slowdowns may have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our performance depends on a new market human capital development and management the market for software solutions that automate human capital development and management is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
substantially all of our revenues are attributable to the suite of products and services in this market 
if this market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect  or if we fail to identify the challenges and risks in this new market and successfully address these risks  our business would be harmed 
our strategy of establishing saba exchange is unproven and may not be successful we must more fully establish and enhance saba exchange  where organizations and learning providers can transact business and collaborate 
our success depends on a significant number of organizations implementing saba learning and conducting business with learning providers over the internet through saba exchange 
if this business strategy is flawed  or if we are unable to execute it effectively  our revenues may be seriously harmed 
we began operating saba exchange in december accordingly  we have limited experience developing and operating saba exchange 
to date  only a limited number of learning providers and organizations are connected to saba exchange 
it is possible that we  together with the organizations and learning providers who comprise this exchange  will not be able to effectively operate this exchange  both in terms of technical performance as well as commercial viability 
it is possible that an insufficient number of organizations and or learning providers will join and remain in saba exchange  and that we will be unable to generate significant revenues from saba exchange 
unless a critical mass of organizations and learning providers join saba exchange  our solutions may not achieve widespread market acceptance and our business would be seriously harmed 
to date  we have not generated significant revenues from saba exchange 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management personnel 
these employees are not subject to employment contracts 
we may not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining our key employees in the future 
our future success and our ability to expand our operations will also depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified technical  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals and the high demand for them  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located 
we have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
failure to attract  assimilate and retain personnel  particularly technical  sales and marketing personnel  would have a material adverse effect on our business and potential growth 
additionally  volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options or been sold restricted stock 
difficulties we may encounter managing our growth could adversely affect our results of operations we intend to grow our business significantly 
to support our growth plans  we may need to expand our existing management  operational  financial and human resources  customer service and management information systems and controls 
we may be unable to expand these systems and to manage our planned growth successfully  and this inability would adversely affect our business 
intense competition in our target market could impair our ability to grow and to achieve profitability the market for our products and services is intensely competitive  dynamic and subject to rapid technological change 
the intensity of the competition and the pace of change are expected to increase in the future 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
we encounter competition with respect to different aspects of our solution from a variety of sources including companies that market and license training  learning  performance  content  resource  talent and staffing management systems  enterprise software vendors that offer human resources information systems and employee relationship management systems with training and performance modules  and potential customers internal development efforts  companies that operate internet based marketplaces for the sale of on line learning  companies that operate internet based marketplaces for the sale of goods and services and could potentially decide to evolve their marketplaces to include content offerings  and internet portals that offer learning content  performance support tools or recruiting services 
because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the electronic commerce market  which comprises a portion of our business model  we expect competition from a variety of established and emerging companies many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products and services obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other learning solution providers  thereby increasing the availability of their services to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  and competitive pressures that we encounter may seriously harm our business 
if we are unable to manage the complexity of conducting business globally  our international revenues may suffer international revenues accounted for of our revenues in fiscal  of our revenues in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal we intend to expand our international presence in the future 
conducting business outside of the united states is subject to certain risks  including changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  language barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  potentially harmful tax consequences  fluctuating exchange rates  price controls and other restrictions on foreign currency  difficulties in obtaining import and export licenses  political and social unrest or disturbances  the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and political or economic constraints on international trade 
we might not successfully market  sell or distribute our products and services in foreign markets  and we cannot be certain that one or more of such factors will not materially adversely affect our future international operations  and consequently  our business and future growth 
we may become subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business  thereby adversely affecting our financial results we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any domestic or foreign governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  export control laws and laws or regulations directly applicable to internet commerce 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may become applicable to us or may be adopted in the future with respect to the internet covering issues such as user privacy  taxation  content  right to access personal data  copyrights  distribution  and characteristics and quality of services 
the applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  and other intellectual property issues  encryption  taxation  libel  export or import matters and personal privacy to the internet is uncertain 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the broad commercial use of the internet and related technologies 
as a result  they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to these laws  including some recently proposed changes  could create uncertainty in the internet marketplace 
such uncertainty could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased costs of litigation or increased service delivery costs 
in addition  we could be liable for the misuse of personal information 
the federal trade commission  the european union and certain state and local authorities have been investigating certain internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
we could incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if these authorities choose to investigate our privacy practices 
our market is subject to rapid technological change and to compete  we must continually enhance our products and services we must continue to enhance and improve the performance  functionality and reliability of our products and services 
the software and electronic commerce industries are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user requirements and preferences  frequent new product and services introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our products and services obsolete 
in the past  we have discovered that some of our customers desire additional performance and functionality not currently offered by our products 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to both internally develop and license leading technologies to enhance our existing products and services  develop new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
in addition  the development of our technology and other proprietary technology involves significant technical and business risks 
we may fail to use new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions  customer requirements or emerging industry standards  we may not be able to increase our revenues and expand our business 
delays in releasing new products or enhanced versions of our existing products could adversely affect our competitive position as part of our strategy  we expect to regularly release new products and new versions of our existing products 
even if our new products or new versions of our existing products contain the features and functionality our customers want  in the event we are unable to timely introduce these new products or product releases  our competitive position may be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the development of currently planned or future products or product releases in a timely and efficient manner 
due to the complexity of our products  internal quality assurance testing and customer testing of pre commercial releases may reveal product performance issues or desirable feature enhancements that could lead us to postpone the release of these products 
in addition  the reallocation of resources associated with any postponement would likely cause delays in the development and release of other future products or enhancements to our currently available products 
any delay in releasing future products or enhancements of our products could cause our stock price to decline 
if we release products containing defects  we may need to halt further shipments and our business and reputation would be harmed products as complex as ours often contain unknown and undetected errors or performance problems 
many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial shipment of new products or enhancements to existing products 
although we attempt to resolve all errors that we believe would be considered serious by our customers before shipment to them  our products are not error free 
these errors or performance problems could result in lost revenues or delays in customer acceptance and would be detrimental to our business and reputation 
as is typical in the software industry  with each release we have discovered errors in our products after introduction 
we will not be able to detect and correct all errors before releasing our products commercially and these undetected errors could be significant 
we cannot assure you that undetected errors or performance problems in our existing or future products will not be discovered in the future or that known errors considered minor by us will not be considered serious by our customers  resulting in a decrease in our revenues 
claims by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property rights  may result in costly litigation in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights  particularly in the software and internet related industries 
on may   ip learn  llc ip learn filed a lawsuit against us alleging that we infringed a number of patents assigned to ip learn  and asking the court for a preliminary and permanent injunction as well as unspecified damages 
we believe that ip learn s claims are without merit  and we intend to defend against them vigorously 
we could become subject to additional intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our products and services overlap with competitive offerings 
any of these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend and could divert management s attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial award of damages and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop noninfringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology  and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
in addition  we have filed nine patent applications in the us we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued or  if issued  such patents will protect our intellectual property or not be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products and services or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
we do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan or back up system  and a disaster could severely damage our operations we currently do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in effect and do not have fully redundant systems for our services at an alternate site 
a disaster could severely harm our business because our services could be interrupted for an indeterminate length of time 
our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect the computer systems needed for the day to day operation of saba exchange and saba learning asp edition 
a number of these computer systems are located on or near known earthquake fault zones 
although these systems are designed to be fault tolerant  they are vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and other events 
additionally  we do not carry sufficient business insurance to compensate us for all potential losses that could occur 
we outsource the management and maintenance of our hosted and asp solutions to third parties and will depend upon them to provide adequate management and maintenance services we rely on third parties to provide key components of our networks and systems 
for instance  we rely on third party internet service providers to host saba exchange and saba learning enterprise edition for customers who desire to have these solutions hosted 
we also rely on third party communications service providers for the high speed connections that link our and our internet service providers web servers and office systems to the internet 
any internet or communications systems failure or interruption could result in disruption of our service or loss or compromise of customer orders and data 
these failures  especially if they are prolonged or repeated  would make our services less attractive to customers and tarnish our reputation 
we depend upon continuing our relationship with third party integrators who support our solutions our success depends upon the acceptance and successful integration by customers of our products 
we often rely on third party systems integrators to assist with implementation of our products 
we will need to continue to rely on these systems integrators even as we increase the size of our professional services group 
if large systems integrators fail to continue to support our solution or commit resources to us  if any of our customers are not able to successfully integrate our solution or if we are unable to adequately train our existing systems integration partners  our business  operating results and financial condition could suffer 
in addition  we have only limited control over the level and quality of service provided by our current and future third party integrators 
we may not be able to secure necessary funding in the future  additional funding may result in dilution to our stockholders we require substantial working capital to fund our business 
we have had significant operating losses and negative cash flow from operations since inception and expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we expect to use our available cash resources and credit facilities primarily to fund sales and marketing activities  research and development  and continued operations  and possibly make future acquisitions 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the next twelve months 
however  if our capital requirements increase materially from those currently planned or if revenues fail to materialize  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
our past and future acquisitions may result in disruptions to our business if we fail to adequately integrate acquired businesses in march  we acquired human performance technologies  inc and in june  we acquired ultris inc as part of our overall business strategy  we expect to continue to acquire complementary businesses or technologies that will provide additional products or services offerings  additional industry expertise or an expanded geographic presence 
these acquisitions could result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  or the incurrence of debt 
in addition  any acquisition may increase the risk of future write offs for acquired in process research and development  write offs for the impairment of goodwill or long lived assets  or amortization of expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect our business and our operating results 
for example  as of may   we had an aggregate of million of purchased intangible assets to be amortized as a result of the acquisition of human performance technologies  inc and ultris inc in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including those described above and the following the announcement of new products and services or product and service enhancements by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts that may follow our stock  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market and industry trends may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company 
class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
sales of shares eligible for future sale could cause our stock price to decline if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
the anti takeover provisions in our charter documents could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquiror were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquiror would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms that make it difficult to remove all directors at once 
the acquiror would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to remove directors at an annual meeting 
the acquiror will not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting  which will require the acquiror to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted 
our board of directors also has the ability to issue preferred stock that would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law limits business combination transactions with stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our board of directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquiror that it did not feel was in our strategic interests 
if the acquiror was discouraged from offering to acquire us or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by the anti takeover measures  you could lose the opportunity to sell your shares at a favorable price 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we provide our services to customers primarily in the united states and  to a lesser extent  in europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by risks typical of an international business 
such factors include  but are not limited to  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  local regulations and restrictions and political climates  weak economic conditions in foreign markets  differing tax structures and foreign currency rate volatility 
sales are primarily made in us dollars  however  as we continue to expand our operations  more of our contracts may be denominated in australian dollars  british pounds  canadian dollars and euros 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises in part from the translation of the financial results of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
at may   the average maturity of our investment securities was approximately four months 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
due to the nature of our cash equivalents and investments  which are primarily money market funds  commercial paper  corporate bonds and us government agency bonds  we believe that there is no material market risk exposure 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
at may   all of our investments were considered available for sale securities and the majority had maturities of less than one year 
the weighted average interest rate of our portfolio was approximately at may
