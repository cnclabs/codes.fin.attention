accounting policies involving significant estimates financial reporting release no

see note to great lakes audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
general the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to inventories  special charges  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and contingencies related to litigation and environmental matters 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
inventories the company is required to state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  the company is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and pricing and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
great lakes recorded write downs of inventory totaling million in due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuing certain product lines  changes in market conditions  customer demand and unmarketable inventory 
if future market conditions are less favorable than those predicted by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
special charges the company recorded special charges before reversals of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these charges were in connection with detailed repositioning and restructuring plans that provided for a series of cost reduction initiatives to further streamline operations  strengthen the company s competitive position and provide a platform for future growth 
the charges associated with these plans included estimates for amounts related to asset impairments  employee severance costs  plant closures and related environmental costs  and the settlement of various contractual obligations resulting from repositioning and restructuring actions 
although the company does not anticipate significant changes to these estimates  the actual costs may differ 
when it is determinable that the actual costs differ from the original estimates  adjustments  either additional charges or reversals  are made to the remaining special charge reserves at that time 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets the company periodically evaluates long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of the company s businesses 
if impairment indicators are present  the company is required to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets 
based upon assessments performed during  the company recorded million of asset impairments including million of impairment losses related to goodwill 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million 
at december  and  management determined that it is more likely than not that million and million  respectively  of certain deferred tax assets will not be realized  requiring the company to establish a valuation allowance for those amounts 
each quarter  the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the likelihood of realization is assessed by using the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to support realization of certain deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  increased competition  general economic conditions  a decline in sales or earnings  loss of market share or delays in product availability 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time for resolution 
in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
pensions the company sponsors various defined benefit pension plans that have significant pension benefit costs developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rates of compensation increases 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
at december   appropriate changes were made in the interest rate and rate of compensation increase assumptions for all plans 
the company currently expects pension costs to increase in by approximately million to million compared to contingencies the company is subject to legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
at december   the company had accrued million and million related to litigation and environmental liabilities  respectively  that management considers probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made 
these accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy  in dealing with these matters

the euro effective january   member states of the european economic and monetary union converted to a common currency known as the euro 
from that date until january  the transition period  either the euro or a participating country s present currency was accepted as legal tender  with the country s existing currency to be completely removed from circulation between january   and july  the company has been preparing for the introduction of the euro since the company s plan for phase out of the existing currencies complied with legal requirements and also was coordinated with the phase out plans of the company s vendors  distributors and customers 
the phase out plan and introduction of the euro required the conversion of information technology systems  recalculation of currency risk  recalibration of derivatives and other financial instruments  evaluation and action  if needed  regarding the continuity of contracts  and modification of processes for preparing tax  accounting  payroll and customer records 
great lakes completed a full implementation of the euro in december new accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application encouraged 
the company will adopt fas as of january   and does not expect that the adoption of the statement will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and is adjusted to its present value each period 
in addition  a corresponding amount must be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset  which is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
a gain or loss may be incurred upon settlement of the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this statement 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the pooling of interest method is no longer permitted for business combinations initiated after june  the company will apply these new rules beginning in the first quarter of application of the non amortization provisions of the statement on goodwill balances at december   is expected to result in an annual increase in net income of approximately million or per share 
during  the company will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill as of january   and has not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which was required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the company adopted the new statement effective january  the statement required the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not afforded special hedge accounting treatment under fas must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is afforded special hedge accounting  depending on the nature of the hedge relationship  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
the effect of the adoption of the statement was immaterial to the results of operations and other comprehensive income loss 
because the statement allows certain foreign currency transactions to be accounted for as hedges for financial reporting purposes that were not previously treated as hedges  the company may change its policies toward the management of certain foreign currency exposures 
any changes that may occur would be to further reduce the company s exposure to foreign currency risks 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and natural gas prices that could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operations and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the derivative financial instruments generally used include swaps  forward contracts and options 
the derivative financial instruments utilized by the company in its hedging activities are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
in addition  derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to limit the exposure of nonperformance on such instruments 
international operations  including us export sales  constitute a significant portion of revenues and identifiable assets 
these operations result in a large volume of foreign currency commitment and transaction exposures and foreign currency net asset exposures 
at december  and  the company s primary net foreign currency market exposures were dispersed through various countries and primarily included the euro and its legacy currencies  the british pound and the japanese yen 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated  when possible  through the use of natural hedges  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another 
the amount of hedging activity and management of commitment and transaction exposures is coordinated at the corporate level 
hedges are set to mature concurrently with the estimated timing of settlement of the underlying transactions 
considering the company s operating profile  at december   the result of a uniform change in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would result in a change in operating income of approximately million 
a similar change in would have had approximately a million effect on operating income 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar  and does not factor in any potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices that may result from changes in exchange rates 
the company uses commercial paper as a source of financing  which exposes the company to changes in short term interest rates 
the company manages its ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  the company  from time to time  enters into interest rate swap agreements in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts that are supported by the company s current debt position 
at december   the company had no interest rate swap agreements in effect 
based on the company s debt position at december   a hypothetical percentage point change in interest rates for a one year period would change income before income taxes by approximately million 
this analysis does not consider any effect that a change in interest rates would have on overall economic activity or management actions to mitigate interest rate changes 
as of december   the company had short term time investments of million representing investment securities with maturities of three months or less 
a hypothetical percentage point change in interest rates earned on these deposits for a one year period would change income before income taxes by million 
during the second quarter of  as part of its risk management strategy  the company entered into fixed price swap and option contracts  including caps and floors  to manage its exposure to changes in natural gas prices 
these natural gas contracts obligate the company to make or receive a payment equal to the net change in the value of the contracts at their maturity 
such contracts are designated as hedges of the company s forecasted purchases through and are effective in hedging the company s exposure to changes in natural gas prices during this period 
the natural gas contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses deferred through other comprehensive income loss and recognized in earnings when realized as an adjustment to cost of products sold 
the fair value of contracts no longer effective as hedges are recognized in cost of products sold from the date that the contracts become ineffective until their expiration 
historically  the company has not closed any natural gas contracts prior to the execution of the underlying purchase transactions  nor have any of the underlying purchase transactions failed to occur 
the fair value of these contracts at december   was immaterial to the company s consolidated financial position 
based on the company s natural gas exposure at december   a hypothetical change in natural gas prices for a one year period would change income before income taxes by approximately million
