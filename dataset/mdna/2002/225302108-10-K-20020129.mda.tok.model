the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form k 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in risk factors and elsewhere herein 
revenue has declined in fiscal in the test and assembly sector of the semiconductor equipment industry during what we believe is a severe cyclical downturn in the industry 
there is uncertainty as to if and when the next cyclical growth phase will occur 
until such time as we return to a growth period  we expect a continuing decline in orders and therefore expect that the january  fiscal quarter s revenue will be flat or down from those recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter of and may continue to decline throughout fiscal our sales  gross margins and operating results have in the past fluctuated significantly and will  in the future  fluctuate significantly depending upon a variety of factors 
the factors that have caused and will continue to cause our results to fluctuate include cyclicality or downturns in the semiconductor market and the markets served by our customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of our products  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start up of new products  changes in pricing by us  our competitors  customers or suppliers  the ability to volume produce systems and meet customer requirements  inventory obsolescence  patterns of capital spending by customers  delays  cancellations or reschedulings of orders due to customer financial difficulties or otherwise  expenses associated with acquisitions and alliances  product discounts  product reliability  the proportion of direct sales and sales through third parties  including distributors and original equipment manufacturers  the mix of products sold  the length of manufacturing and sales cycles  natural disasters  political and economic instability  regulatory changes and outbreaks of hostilities 
due to these and additional factors  historical results and percentage relationships discussed in this annual report on form k will not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
for a further discussion of our business  and risk factors affecting our results of operations  please refer to the section entitled risk factors included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates we historically recognized revenue on the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment upon shipment 
we changed our revenue recognition policy based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
in august  we acquired ims using the pooling of interests accounting method see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
because ims had already adopted sab in the ims fiscal year ended december   we elected to conform our revenue recognition practices to ims 
accordingly  we elected to adopt sab effective november   ie  fiscal 
in accordance with guidance provided in sab  we recorded a non cash charge of million after reduction for income taxes of million  or per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal as a result of the adoption of sab  the increase to net income for fiscal year was million or per basic share and per diluted share 
this amount is comprised of equipment that was shipped to certain customers and previously recorded as revenue  but had not been accepted as of october  under sab  we recognize revenue on the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment when the product is classified as mature and the customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
revenue related to the fair value of the installation obligation is recognized upon completion of the installation 
products are classified as mature after several different customers have accepted similar systems 
for sales of new products or when the customer acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue and the related cost of goods sold are deferred until customer acceptance 
under the new sab revenue recognition policy  we will be deferring revenue for transactions that involve newly introduced products or when customers specify acceptance criteria that cannot be demonstrated prior to the shipment 
we currently anticipate introducing several new systems in fiscal in the past  we experienced significant delays in the introduction of new testers as well as certain enhancements to our existing testers 
as a result  some customers have experienced significant delays in receiving and accepting our testers in production 
delays in introducing a product or delays in our ability to obtain customer acceptance  if they occur in the future  will delay the recognition of revenue and gross profit by us 
with the dramatic decline in revenue during fiscal  we continue to monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and expectations of an eventual market upturn 
we recorded a charge of million in the second fiscal quarter of and a charge of million in the fourth fiscal quarter of for the write down of excess inventories 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory if the industry downturn causes further reductions to our current inventory valuations or changes our current product development plans 
we evaluate our inventory levels and valuations based on our estimates and forecasts of the next cyclical industry upturn 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to sell current and future products in the next industry upturn and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need to adjust our assessment of the inventory valuations 
at october   approximately and of the inventory balances are for the quartet mixed signal and kalos memory product families  respectively 
during industry downturns  certain of our customers have difficulty with their cash flows 
for certain customers  typically those with whom we have long term relationships  we may grant extended payment terms 
we review  with assistance from our sales distribution partners  the ability of our customers to pay the indebtedness they incur with us 
certain of our receivables have due dates in excess of days and we have a history of successfully collecting these extended payment term receivables 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for all specific receivables that we judge to be unlikely for collection 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against which we have not established a specific reserves 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding customer s credit worthiness known to us 
realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately  of future taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized  based on forecasted income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future income 
management will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assess the need for additional valuation allowances 
results of operations in august  we completed a merger with ims  issuing approximately million shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of ims 
in addition  outstanding options to purchase ims common stock were converted into options to purchase approximately million shares of credence common stock 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  therefore  all prior period consolidated financial statements presented  and the consolidated financial statements as of october  and for the year then ended  were restated as if the merger took place at the beginning of such periods 
ims had a calendar fiscal year and  accordingly  the ims statement of operations for the years ended december  and have been combined with the our statement of operations for the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively 
in order to conform ims s year end to our fiscal year end  the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal includes the results of operations of ims for two months may and june in the consolidated results of operations in each of the quarters ended april  and july  accordingly  our fiscal first quarter includes the ims results of operations for the three month period ended march   the second fiscal quarter includes the ims results of operations for the three month period ended june   the third fiscal quarter includes the ims results of operations for the three month period ended july   and the fourth fiscal quarter includes the ims results of operations for the three months period ended october  the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated fiscal years ended october  net sales cost of goods sold on net sales cost of goods sold special charges gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets in process research and development special charges total operating expenses operating income loss cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss vs 
net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from the sale of systems  upgrades  spare parts  maintenance contracts and software 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our net sales decreased from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  our net sales have declined due to what we believe is a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry that is in sharp contrast to the quarterly increases in fiscal international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for our products in capital markets in korea and other areas of asia have been highly volatile  resulting in economic instabilities 
these instabilities may reoccur which could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of mixed signal logic memory service and software total the increase in the memory percentage of net sales is attributable principally to sales of the kalos product line 
revenues from software were not material to our operations in fiscal and  representing less than of our net sales in each respective period 
gross margin 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in is principally the result of the million write down of excess inventories recorded during the year 
these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in excluding the write down of excess inventories  our gross margin as a percentage of sales would have been in fiscal the lower gross margin excluding the effect of the write down is primarily attributed to lower manufacturing absorption resulting from the lower business levels in as well as lower average selling prices during fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
r d expenses increased in absolute dollars to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting higher investments in the development of new products  and enhancements of existing product lines 
the higher level of spending in fiscal reflects the acquisitions of tmt and mi in fiscal as well as increases in internal r d project expenses 
we currently intend to continue to invest significant resources in the development of new products and enhancements for the foreseeable future and would expect r d expenses to be higher in absolute dollars in fiscal than those recorded in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the lower spending in in absolute dollars was primarily due to lower headcount and commission expenses  salary reductions  and periodic company shutdowns during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were in compared to in fiscal  reflecting the decrease in business levels 
we expect sg a expenses for fiscal to be flat or higher in absolute dollars than those recorded in fiscal amortization of purchased intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible asset expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
in january and february  we purchased dci and the assets of the rabkin group for approximately million 
these acquisitions have resulted in approximately million in quarterly charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets 
in may  we purchased tmt for approximately million  in august we purchased mi for approximately million and credence europa for approximately million  and in october we purchased nms for approximately million 
these acquisitions have resulted in approximately million  million  million  and million  respectively  in quarterly charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets 
our management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets to be used in the business as well as research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
the purchased intangibles consist of developed technology  assembled workforce  customer relationships  trade names and trademarks  patents  and goodwill and they typically have estimated useful lives of three to ten years 
intangible purchased assets are generally evaluated on a market by market basis in making a determination as to whether such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are still appropriate 
in conjunction with an independent consultant we periodically review our long lived assets including goodwill for impairment based on estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to the assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
special charges 
in the second quarter of fiscal we recorded a charge of approximately million for severance payments and asset disposals associated with headcount reductions we implemented in february these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in in the third quarter of fiscal we recorded a further million for severance payments and asset disposals associated with headcount reductions we implemented in may and august in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded an additional million for headcount reductions 
we have reduced headcount by more than people during the fiscal year across all functional areas 
severance payments have been distributed during the year and the remaining accruals at october  are not significant 
in the second and third quarters of fiscal we recorded charges of approximately million related to fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of ims 
an additional million was recorded in the fourth quarter for the closing of the ims transaction and the integration of its operations with credence and our subsidiary  fluence 
this charge included the write down of million of goodwill and purchased technology intangible assets of opmaxx 
the impairment was recorded based on product decisions for the newly combined operations of fluence and ims 
the elements of the ims acquisition charges are as follows in thousands fees and expenses investment banking  legal  accounting  d o insurance  travel  etc 
 write down of tangible and intangible assets  lease and liability accruals  employee termination benefits  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge for the impairment of the remaining intangible assets associated with the acquisition of nms in october this impairment was based on significant nms employee turnover in fiscal as well as a change in the technological direction of the remaining research and development project that originated in nms 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge for the abandonment of the former tmt facility in sunnyvale  california as these operations were integrated into our fremont  california facilities 
this charge consisted of in estimated future rental payments to be paid through february and million for asset and leasehold improvement write downs 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the slight decline in fiscal was primarily due to lower average interest rates in fiscal when compared to fiscal interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses decreased to million from million in fiscal from fiscal  primarily due to lower interest expenses on the convertible subordinated notes that were redeemed in september income tax 
our effective tax benefit rate was for fiscal the effective tax benefit rate was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to non deductible goodwill amortization 
the effective tax rate for fiscal of was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate due to benefits of our foreign sales subsidiary  partially offset by non deductible in process research and development expenses and non deductible goodwill amortization 
realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately  of future taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized  based on forecasted income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future income 
management will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assess the need for additional valuation allowances 
at october  the net deferred tax assets were million 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
at october  and  the goodwill and other intangible assets represented and of total assets  respectively  and and of stockholders equity  respectively 
these assets principally arose from the acquisition of dci and asset purchase of rabkin in fiscal and the acquisitions of tmt  mi  nms  and credence europa in fiscal the estimated useful lives of these assets range from three to ten years 
goodwill and intangible assets are generally evaluated on an individual acquisition  market  or product basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are no longer appropriate 
periodically  the company reviews its long lived assets including goodwill for impairment based on estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to the assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded a million charge for the impairment of the remaining intangible assets associated with the acquisition of nms in october this impairment was based on significant nms employee turnover in fiscal as well as a change in the technological direction of the remaining research and development project that originated in nms 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ims in august  the company s subsidiary  fluence was merged with ims 
the integration of fluence with ims resulted in the write down of million of the goodwill and purchased technology intangible assets of opmaxx 
this impairment was based on product decisions for the newly combined operations of fluence and ims 
vs 
net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our net sales increased from million in the first quarter of fiscal  reaching million in the fourth fiscal quarter of and then rose to million for the fourth fiscal quarter of during fiscal  our net sales improved each sequential quarter because of three principal factors 
a significant increase in the worldwide demand for semiconductor ate  
improved business and economic conditions in asia and particularly in taiwan  and 
the increased sales of two major products that were recently launched the quartet high performance mixed signal tester and the kalos memory tester 
these factors plus the acquisition of the tmt product lines in may resulted in our experiencing increasing net sales activity through fiscal and the improved worldwide demand for semiconductor ate has led to customers purchasing for increased capacity and the launch of our new products has led to some customers purchasing products with new features or capabilities 
international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for our products in capital markets in korea and other areas of asia have been highly volatile  resulting in economic instabilities 
these instabilities may reoccur which could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of mixed signal logic memory service and software total the increase in the memory percentage of net sales is attributable principally to sales derived from the kalos product line 
the increase in the mixed signal percentage of net sales is principally derived from the sales of the quartet product and the acquired tmt product lines 
revenues from software were not material to our operations in fiscal and  representing less than of net sales in each respective period 
gross margin 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in was due primarily to higher average selling prices during the latter half of fiscal and into fiscal as well as efficiencies caused by the higher manufacturing volumes in research and development 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and  respectively 
r d expenses increased in absolute dollars to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting higher investments in the development of new products  and enhancements of existing product lines 
we experienced higher business activity levels in fiscal and these resulted in significant internal headcount growth as well as the acquisitions of tmt  mi  nms  and credence europa during fiscal year selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal resulted primarily from much higher business activity levels 
these higher activity levels resulted in significant internal headcount growth as well as the acquisitions of tmt  mi  nms  and credence europa during fiscal year during early fiscal  we undertook a project to replace a majority of our financial  manufacturing  distribution  planning and control systems with the r system from sap america  inc this system became operational in june in september  we relocated our oregon operations to a newly constructed facility in hillsboro  oregon 
amortization of purchased intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible asset expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
in may  we purchased tmt for approximately million  in august we purchased mi for approximately million and credence europa for approximately million  and in october we purchased nms for approximately million 
these acquisitions resulted in approximately million  million  million  and million  respectively  in quarterly charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets in fiscal year in september  we purchased opmaxx for million 
this acquisition resulted in quarterly charges for amortization of purchased intangibles of million 
our management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets to be used in the business as well as research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
the purchased intangibles consist of developed technology  assembled workforce  customer relationships  trade names and trademarks  patents  and goodwill and they typically have estimated useful lives of three to ten years 
intangible purchased assets are generally evaluated on a market by market basis in making a determination as to whether such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are still appropriate 
periodically  we reviews our long lived assets including goodwill for impairment based on estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to the assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
in process research and development 
in may  we purchased tmt for approximately million 
in connection with this acquisition  we recognized million of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d 
in august  we purchased mi for approximately million 
in connection with this acquisition  we recognized million of ipr d 
in october  we purchased nms for approximately million 
in connection with this acquisition  we recognized million of acquired ipr d 
in september  we purchased opmaxx for million 
in connection with this acquisition  we recognized million of ipr d 
we worked with an independent consultant to perform an allocation of the purchase price for the tmt  mi  and nms acquisitions to their respective individual assets using the income approach 
our income approach utilized a discounted future earnings methodology 
our management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets resulting from  or to be used in  research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
our review indicated that the ipr d had not reached a state of technological feasibility and the underlying technology had no alternative future use to us in other research and development projects or otherwise 
in the case of ipr d  fair values of the corresponding technologies were determined using an income approach  which included a discounted future earnings methodology 
under this methodology  the value of the in process technology is comprised of the total present value of the anticipated after tax cash flows attributable to the in process project  discounted to net present value  taking into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased ipr d 
the ipr d acquired from tmt consists of products and projects related to analog and radio frequency test products 
these products and projects are aimed at the development of the asl product as well as further versions of the rfx product 
we estimated that these projects varied in terms of completion from to completed based on research and development complexity  costs  and time expended to date relative to the expected remaining costs and time to reach technological feasibility 
the expected completion dates of these projects range from completed to the third quarter of fiscal the tmt products and projects are integrated into our industrial  communications and entertainment test division 
the ipr d acquired from mi consists of products and projects related to radio frequency test products 
these products and projects are aimed at the development of the modulated vector network analyzer instrument in various forms 
we estimated that these projects varied in terms of completion from to completed based on research and development complexity  costs  and time expended to date relative to the expected remaining costs and time to reach technological feasibility 
the expected completion dates of these projects range from completed to late fiscal the mi products and projects are integrated into our industrial  communications and entertainment test division 
the ipr d acquired from nms consists of products and projects related to application specific testing products asts 
these products and projects are aimed at the development of an asts tester 
we estimated that these projects were approximately completed based on research and development complexity  costs  and time expended to date relative to the expected remaining costs and time to reach technological feasibility 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge for the impairment of the remaining goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of nms 
this impairment was based on significant nms employee turnover in fiscal as well as a change in the technological direction of the remaining research and development project that originated in nms 
the ipr d acquired from opmaxx consists of products and projects related to analog and mixed signal self test 
these products and projects are aimed at the development of design verification and sensitivity analysis  design fault coverage  test evaluation and optimization 
we estimated that approximately of the research and development effort  based on time spent and complexity  had been completed at the date of the acquisition 
these projects were completed in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a write down of million of goodwill and purchased technology intangible assets from opmaxx 
the impairment was recorded based on product decisions for the newly combined operations of fluence and ims 
special charges 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million  of which million was for employee severance and million was for abandoned facilities 
these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries at that time as well as the decision to relocate our oregon operations from a facility in beaverton to a newly constructed facility in hillsboro  oregon 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million 
this charge included expenses related to the opmaxx acquisition of million as well as the million write down of certain intangible assets from another acquisition in the integration of opmaxx with fluence 
extraordinary gain extinguishment of debt 
in fiscal  we recorded a pre tax extraordinary gain of million for the retirement of million of our convertible subordinated notes in exchange for  shares of our common stock held in treasury 
interest income 
we generated interest and other income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was due to higher average cash and investment balances in as compared to these higher average balances were the result of cash received in our secondary public offering in february offset by cash outlays for acquisitions in the year and the purchase of our oregon facility 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to lower interest expense on a lower average outstanding balance of our convertible subordinated notes 
income tax 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal  and the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was reduced by benefits of the company s foreign sales subsidiary  partially offset by non deductible in process research and development expenses and non deductible goodwill amortization 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was reduced by research and development credits 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  net cash used by operating activities was million 
this use of cash was primarily attributable to the earnings before depreciation and amortization and non cash special charges of million offset by an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of million 
this increase in net operating assets was made up of declines in accounts receivable offset by increases in inventories and decreases in the current liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million 
this cash was primarily used for net purchases of property and equipment of million and the acquisition of the intangible assets of rabkin and dci of million 
this was offset by the net sale of million in our available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to common stock and treasury stock issued in accordance with our employee stock option and stock purchase plans offset by the repurchase of  shares of common stock at a cost of million 
as of october   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities  compared with million at october  additionally  as of october   we have operating leases for facilities and test and other equipment totaling approximately million due through we expect that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investment balances and anticipated cash flow from operations will satisfy our financing requirements in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months 
we have an agreement with a captive leasing company whereby we issued a guaranty in favor of a bank with respect to certain obligations of the leasing company to the bank 
under this agreement  the leasing company agreed to grant to us a security interest to secure the obligations of the leasing company as a result of any payments by us pursuant to the guaranty 
at october   the maximum allowable debt of the leasing company subject to this guaranty of  was outstanding 
we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycles of many of our testers and the new products we have introduced and plan to continue to introduce  investments in inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
significant investments in accounts receivable and inventories subject us to increased risks  and could continue to materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and has experienced downturns  which have had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for automatic test equipment  including equipment manufactured and marketed by us 
in addition  the automatic test equipment industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
it is reasonably possible that events related to the above factors may occur in the near term which would cause a change to our estimate of the net realizable value of receivables  inventories or other assets  and the adequacy of costs accrued for warranty and other liabilities

 or sfas  business combinations 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  in addition  sfas further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
specifically  sfas requires that an intangible asset may be separately recognized only if such an asset meets the contractual legal criterion or the separability criterion 
the requirements of sfas are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after june  ie  the acquisition date is july  or after 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas and have not yet determined the impact that adopting sfas will have on our financial statements 
on adoption  we will be required to reassess the goodwill and intangible assets previously recorded in acquisitions prior to july  to determine if the new recognition criteria for an intangible asset to be recognized apart from goodwill are met 
in july  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  the impairment review will involve a comparison of fair value to carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recorded as an impairment loss 
for goodwill  the impairment test shall be a two step process  consisting of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
separable intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be reviewed for impairment in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the amortization provisions of sfas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   we will apply the new accounting rules beginning november  and will reassess the useful lives of our separately recognized intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal we will review for impairment previously recognized intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives upon the completion of this analysis in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  upon the adoption of sfas  we will perform a transitional impairment review related to the carrying value of goodwill as of november  by the end of the second quarter of fiscal because of the different transition dates for goodwill and intangible assets acquired on or before june  and those acquired after that date  pre existing goodwill and intangibles will be amortized during this transition period until adoption whereas new goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets acquired after june  will not

foreign exchange we generate a significant portion of our sales from sales to customers located outside the united states  principally in asia and to a lesser extent europe 
international sales are made mostly to foreign distributors and some foreign subsidiaries and are typically denominated in us dollars and occasionally are denominated in the local currency for european and japanese customers 
the subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  some of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency
