balance sheet data at december  in thousands assets total capitalization notes payable shareholders equity total item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company has one reportable operating segment with two primary lines of business  individual annuities and individual life insurance 
operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
premiums shown on the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap consist of premiums received for whole or term life insurance products  as well as that portion of the company s single premium immediate annuities which have life contingencies 
with respect to that portion of single premium annuity contracts without life contingencies  as well as single premium deferred annuities and universal life insurance products  premiums collected by the company are not reported as premium revenues  but rather are reported as additions to policyholders account balances 
with respect to prod ucts that are accounted for as policyholders account balances  revenues are recognized over time in the form of policy fee income  surrender charges and mortality and other charges deducted from the policyholders account balances 
the company s operating earnings are derived primarily from these revenues  plus the company s investment results  including realized gains losses  less interest credited  benefits to policyholders and expenses 
certain costs related to the sale of new business are deferred as deferred policy acquisition costs dac and amortized into expenses in proportion to the recognition of earned revenues 
costs deferred include principally commissions  certain expenses of the policy issue and underwriting departments and certain variable sales expenses 
under certain circumstances  dac will be expensed earlier than originally estimated  including those circumstances where the policy terminations are higher than originally estimated with respect to certain annuity products 
most of the company s annuity products have surrender charges which are designed to discourage and mitigate the effect of early terminations 
the insurance company is rated a excellent by am best 
results of operations comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year and fiscal year to fiscal year revenues annuity considerations and life insurance premiums total annuity considerations and life insurance premiums increased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  an increase of approximately 
of this amount  annuity considerations increased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  an increase of approximately million 
in accordance with gaap  sales of single premium deferred annuities are not reported as annuity considerations  but rather as additions to policyholder account balances 
sales of single premium annuities were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
management believes that the increase in annuity considerations is due to the successful expansion of our marketing department 
beginning in  the company added regional sales directors in various states 
these regional sales directors have added new general agents  which have generated s ales 
total annuity considerations and life insurance premiums increased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  an increase of approximately

policy fee income universal life and investment type policy fee income was approximately 
million in fiscal  as compared to approximately 
million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the increase in is attributed to a rise in the number of life policies surrendered during that were within the surrender charge period 
policy fee income consists principally of amounts assessed during the period against policyholders account balances for mortality charges and surrender charges 
net investment income net investment income totaled approximately million in fiscal  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal this represents approximately a increase comparing fiscal to fiscal and approximately an increase comparing fiscal to fiscal investment income from other invested assets totaled approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  and  the insurance company participated in dollar roll transactions ie  the sale of a mortgage backed security and a simultaneous agreement to purchase a similar security at a later date at a lower price to enhance investment income 
the proceeds from the sale are invested in short term securities at a positive spread until the settlement date of the similar security 
during this period  the holding institution receives all income and prepayme nts for the security 
the company s ratio of net investment income to average cash and invested assets less net investment income for the years ended december   and was approximately  and  respectively 
for additional information  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
realized investment gains and losses realized investment losses amounted to approximately million in fiscal  as compared to approximately million of losses in fiscal and gains of approximately million in fiscal realized investment losses for years ended december  and and gains for the year ended december  include realized investment losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  attributable to writedowns of certain securities contained in the company s investment portfolio 
realized investment gains losses result from sales of certain equities and convertible securities  and calls and sales of fixed maturity investments in the company s investment portfolio 
there can be no assurance that the company s investment portfolio will yield comparable investment results in future periods 
total benefits and expenses total benefits and expenses for fiscal aggregated approximately million  as compared to approximately million for fiscal and approximately million for fiscal this represents an increase of approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal and an increase of approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal the reasons for these changes will be discussed under the respective components below 
interest credited and benefits to policyholders interest credited and benefits to policyholders amounted to approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal this represents an increase of approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal and approximately a increase comparing fiscal to fiscal these increases principally are attributable to a higher level of policyholder account balances as a result of the increase in annuity considerations received during the respective years 
the insurance company s average credited rates for reserves and account balances for the months ended december   and were less than the company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets for the same periods as noted above under net investment income 
although management does not currently expect material declines in the spread between the company s average credited rate for reserves and account balances and the company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets the spread  there can be no assurance that the spread will not decline in future periods or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
depending  in part  upon competitive factors affecting the industry in general  and the company in particular  the company may  from time to time  adjust the average credited rates on certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will reduce such rates or that any such reductions will broaden the spread 
interest expense on notes payable the interest expense on the company s notes payable amounted to approximately million in fiscal  approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense in fiscal is attributable to the reclassification of the company s rate lock loss in connection with the issuance of the senior notes due general expenses  taxes and commissions general expenses  taxes and commissions to agents totaled approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal this represents an increase of approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal and an increase of approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to  principally is attributable to higher costs associated with higher commissions and selling expenses incurred associated with the higher level of sales of single premium annuities 
deferred policy acquisition costs the change in the net dac for fiscal resulted in a credit of approximately million  as compared to a credit of approximately million in fiscal and a credit of approximately million in fiscal such changes are due i to the increase in costs associated with recent new product sales which have been deferred and are amortized in proportion to the recognition of earned revenue and ii to the effect of revisions to estimated gross profits on unamortized deferred acquisition costs which are reflected in the year such estimated gross profits are revised 
income before income taxes for the reasons discussed above  income loss before income taxes amounted to approximately million in fiscal  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal income taxes income tax expense benefit was approximately million for fiscal  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the decrease in income taxes in fiscal is primarily attributable to realized capital losses during fiscal the company s strategy was to utilize a carryback of its net capital gains reported in the company s consolidated tax return in and net income for the reasons discussed above  the company had net loss income of approximately million in fiscal  net income of approximately million in fiscal and net income of approximately million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company is an insurance holding company and its primary uses of cash are debt service obligations  operating expenses and dividend payments 
the company s principal sources of cash are dividends from the insurance company  sales of and interest on the company s investments and rent from its real estate 
during  the company s board of directors maintained the quarterly dividend rate of 
per share 
during and  the company purchased and retired  and  shares of common stock  respectively 
at december   the company was authorized to purchase approximately an additional  shares of common stock 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances  that it may make to the company without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under the new york insurance law  the insurance company is permitted without prior insurance regulatory clearance to pay a stockholder dividend to the company as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its surplus as of the immediately preceding calendar year and ii its net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year excluding realized capital gains 
the insurance company will be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend to the company in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the superintendent and the superintendent does not disapprove the distribution 
under the new york insurance law  the superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders 
the nysdi has established informal guidelines for such determinations 
the guidelines  among other things  focus on the insurer s overall financial condition and profitability under statutory accounting practices 
management of the company cannot provide assurance that the insurance company will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the company in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
the company s other insurance subsidiary is also subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends to their respective parent companies 
during fiscal  and  the insurance company paid dividends of million  million and million  respectively  to the company 
principal sources of funds at the insurance company are premiums and other considerations paid  net investment income received and proceeds from investments called  redeemed or sold 
the principal uses of these funds are the payment of benefits on annuity contracts and life insurance policies  including withdrawals and surrender payments  the payment of policy acquisition costs  operating expenses and the purchase of investments 
net cash provided by the company s operating activities reflecting principally i premiums and contract charges collected less ii benefits paid on life insurance and annuity products plus iii income collected on invested assets less iv commissions and other general expenses paid was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used in the company s investing activities principally reflecting investments purchased less investments called  redeemed or sold was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
for purposes of the company s consolidated statements of cash flows  financing activities relate primarily to dollar roll repurchase transactions  and to sales and surrenders of the company s annuity and universal life insurance products 
the payment of dividends by the company to its stockholders also is considered to be a financing activity 
net cash provided by used in the company s financing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these fluctuations primarily are attributable to the new line of credit established in  higher policyholder account balances as a result of increased sales  partially offset by the payment of dividends to the company s shareholders during fiscal year during the first quarter of  the company sold million of its senior notes due the net proceeds were used to retire all of the outstanding million  senior notes and to repay the amounts outstanding on the bank line of credit 
the repayment of the senior notes resulted in an extraordinary loss of thousand  after income taxes of thousand 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants relating to limitations on liens and sale or issuance of capital stock of the insurance company 
in the event the company violates such covenants as defined in the indenture  the company may be obligated to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding principal amount of such notes 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all of the covenants 
given the insurance company s historic cash flow and current financial results  management believes that  for the next twelve months and for the reasonably foreseeable future  the insurance company s cash flow from operating activities will provide sufficient liquidity for the operations of the insurance company  as well as provide sufficient funds to the company  so that the company will be able to make dividend payments  as described in item market for the registrant s common equity and related shareholder matters  satisfy its debt service obligations and pay its other operating expenses 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  the primary market risk to the company s investment portfolio is interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to equity price risk and foreign exchange risk is not significant 
the company has no direct commodity risk 
the company believes that its fixed rate liabilities should be backed by a portfolio principally composed of fixed rate investments that generate predictable rates of return 
the company does not have a specific target rate of return 
instead  its rates of return vary over time depending on the current interest rate environment  the slope of the yield curve  the spread at which fixed rate investments are priced over the yield curve  and general economic conditions 
its portfolio strategy is constructed with a view to achieve adequate risk adjusted returns consistent with its investment objectives of effective asset liability matching  liquidity and safety 
the company s deferred annuity products are designed to encourage persistency by incorporating surrender charges 
an annuitant may not terminate or withdraw substantial funds for a period of generally seven years without incurring significant penalties in the form of surrender charges 
approximately  and of the company s deferred annuity contracts in force measured by reserves as of december    and are surrenderable without charge 
the decrease since december  is attributable to the increase in deferred annuity contracts inforce as a result of the increase in annuity considerations received 
the market value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio changes as interest rates change 
in general  rate decreases cause asset prices to rise  while rate increases cause asset prices to fall 
interest rate sensitivity can be modeled using the fixed maturity s effective duration and convexity to estimate price change for a given rate change 
to model such changes  both spreads and yield curve slope are held constant while the portfolio is subjected to a hypothetical instantaneous rate change 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure since the model does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical loss in market value 
based on market values and prevailing interest rates as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous increase of basis points would produce a loss in fair value of fixed maturity assets of approximately million 
since the company is able to hold its fixed maturity securities to maturity  it does not expect to realize significant losses under such a hypothetical scenario 
to meet its anticipated liquidity requirements  the company purchases investments taking into account the anticipated future cash flow requirements of its underlying liabilities 
in managing the relationship between assets and liabilities  the company analyzes the cash flows necessary to correspond with the expected cash needs on the underlying liabilities under various interest rate scenarios 
in addition  the company invests a portion of its total assets in short term investments approximately  and as of december   and  respectively 
the weighted average duration of the company s bond portfolio was approximately five and three quarter years as of december  the company s fixed maturity investments are all classified as available for sale and include those securities available to be sold in response to  among other things  changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  the company s need for liquidity and other similar factors 
these investments are carried at estimated market value  and unrealized gains losses  net of federal income taxes and deferred policy acquisition costs  if any  are charged directly to shareholders equity  unless a decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary  in which event the company recognizes a loss 
equity securities include common stocks and non redeemable preferred stocks and are carried at market  with the related unrealized gains and losses  net of federal income taxes  if any  charged or credited directly to shareholders equity  unless a decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary  in which event the company recognizes a loss 
capital expenditures during fiscal were approximately  as of december   the company had no outstanding commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the insurance company is subject to regulation adopted and promulgated by the nysdi 
under this regulation  the insurance company s ownership of below investment grade debt securities is limited to of total admitted assets  as calculated under statutory accounting practices 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the insurance company s total admitted assets were invested in below investment grade debt securities 
the company maintains a portfolio which includes below investment grade securities which were purchased to achieve a more favorable investment yield  all of which are classified as available for sale and reported at estimated market value 
as of december  and  the carrying value of these securities was approximately million and million  respectively representing approximately and  respectively  of the company s total assets and and  respectively  of shareholders equity 
investments in below investment grade debt securities have different risks than investments in corporate debt securities rated investment grade 
risk of loss upon default by the borrower is significantly greater with respect to below investment grade debt securities than with respect to other corporate debt securities because below investment grade debt securities generally are unsecured and often are subordinated to other creditors of the issuer 
also  issuers of below investment grade debt securities usually have high levels of indebtedness and often are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  such as recession or increasing interest rates  than are investment grade issuers 
typically  there is only a thinly traded market for such securities and recent market quotations may not be available for some of these securities 
market quotes generally are available only from a limited number of dealers and may not represent firm bids of such dealers or prices for actual sales 
the com pany attempts to reduce the overall risk in its below investment grade portfolio  as in all of its investments  through careful credit analysis  investment policy limitations  and diversification by company and by industry 
below investment grade debt investments  as well as other investments  are being monitored on an ongoing basis 
in certain situations  the terms of some fixed maturity assets are restructured or modified 
there were no restructured fixed maturities at december  as of december   approximately of the company s total invested assets were invested in limited partnerships 
pursuant to nysdi regulations  the company s investments in equity securities  including limited partnership interests  may not exceed of the insurance company s invested assets 
investments in limited partnerships are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet under the heading other invested assets 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is committed  if called upon during a specified period  to contribute an aggregate of approximately million of additional capital to certain of these limited partnerships 
however  management does not expect this entire amount to be called because certain of these limited partnerships are nearing the end of the period during which investors are required to make contributions 
the company may make selective investments in additional limited partnerships as opportunities arise 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which is mitigated by the ability of the company to take annual distributions of partnership earnings 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships as it has historically or that the company will achieve any returns on such investments at all 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of return on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
as previously discussed  in fiscal and the company participated in dollar roll repurchase agreement transactions 
amounts outstanding to repurchase securities under such agreements were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company may engage in selected dollar roll transactions as market opportunities arise 
all states of the united states  the district of columbia and puerto rico have insurance guaranty fund laws requiring all life insurance companies doing business within the jurisdictions to participate in guaranty associations  which are organized to pay contractual obligations under insurance policies and certificates issued under group insurance policies issued by impaired or insolvent life insurance companies 
these associations levy assessments up to prescribed limits on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer is engaged 
some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets 
these assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s solvency 
the amount of these assessments in prior years has not been material  however  the amount and timing of any future assessment on the insurance company under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond the control of the company and the insurance company 
recent failures of substantially larger insurance companies could result in future assessments in material amounts 
see item business insurance regulation for a description of certain naic initiatives that also may impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes the company seeks to manage its investment portfolio in part to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  and the company s net investment income increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
for example  if interest rates decline  the company s fixed maturity investments generally will increase in market value  while net investment income will decrease as fixed income investments mature or are sold and proceeds are reinvested at the declining rates  and vice versa 
management is aware that prevailing market interest rates frequently shift and  accordingly  the company has adopted strategies which are designed to address either an increase or decrease in prevailing rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  the company s average cost of funds would be expected to increase over t ime as it prices its new and renewing annuities to maintain a generally competitive market rate 
in addition  the market value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio decreases resulting in a decline in shareholders equity 
concurrently  the company would attempt to place new funds in investments which were matched in duration to  and higher yielding than  the liabilities associated with such annuities 
management believes that liquidity necessary in such an interest rate environment to fund withdrawals  including surrenders  would be available through income  cash flow  the company s cash reserves or from the sale of short term investments 
in a declining interest rate environment  the company s cost of funds would be expected to decrease over time  reflecting lower interest crediting rates on its fixed annuities 
should increased liquidity be required for withdrawals in such an interest rate environment  management believes that the portion of the company s investments which are designated as available for sale in the company s consolidated balance sheet could be sold without materially adverse consequences in light of the general strengthening in market prices which would be expected in the fixed maturity security market 
interest rate changes also may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of the universal life and annuity products offered by the company 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as annuity or life insurance products offered by the company s competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds and similar instruments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of the company s products until the company increases the rates credited to holders of its universal life and annuity products 
in contrast  as interest rates fall  the company attempts to lower its credited rates to compensate for the corresponding decline in its net investment income 
as a result  changes in interest rates could materially adversely effect the financial condition and results of operations of the company depending on the attractiveness of alternative investments available to the company s customers 
in that regard  in the current interest rate environment  the company has attempted to maintain its credited rates at competitive levels which are designed to discourage surrenders and which may be considered attractive to purchasers of new annuity products 
in addition  because the level of prevailing interest rates impacts the company as well as its competition  management does not believe that the current interest rate environment has materially affected the company s competitive position vis a vis other life insurance companies that emphasize the sale of annuity products 
notwithstanding the foregoing  if interest rates continue at current levels or decline  there can be no assurance that this segment of the life insurance industry  including the company  would not experience increased levels of surrenders and reduced sales and thereby be materially adversely affected 
forward looking information the company cautions readers regarding certain forward looking statements contained in this report and in any other statements made by  or on behalf of  the company  whether or not in future filings with the sec 
forward looking statements are statements not based n historical information and which relate to future operations  strategies  financial results  or other developments 
statements using verbs such as expect  anticipate  believe or words of similar import generally involve forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  forward looking statements include statements which represent the company s beliefs concerning future levels of sales and redemptions of the company s products  investment spreads and yields  or the earnings and profitability of the company s activities 
forward looking statements are necessarily based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control and many of which are subject to change 
these uncertainties and contingencies could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
whether or not actual results differ materially from forward looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable developments 
some may be national in scope  such as general economic conditions  changes in tax law and changes in interest rates 
some may be related to the insurance industry generally  such as pricing competition  regulatory developments and industry consolidation 
others may relate to the company specifically  such as credit  volatility and other risks associated with the company s investment portfolio 
the company disclaims any obligation to update forward looking information
