item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from its estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required by the policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  the company has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies that are described below 
merchandise inventory 
the company s merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
market development accruals 
the company estimates reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
long lived assets  excluding goodwill 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the company reduces the carrying value to its fair value 
goodwill 
goodwill is continually reviewed for impairment 
the carrying value of goodwill would be impaired if the estimate of future discounted cash flows is less than carrying value 
if goodwill is impaired  the loss is measured using estimated fair value 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
the company believes at this time that the long lived asset s carrying values and useful lives continues to be appropriate 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
deferred taxes 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to interest rate change market risk 
since our borrowing patterns are cyclical  the company is not dependent on borrowing throughout the year 
never the less  a sudden increase in interest rates which under the line of credit is at the prime rate or lower may  especially during peak borrowing  potentially have a significant negative impact on the company s results of operations 
we have not used  and currently do not anticipate using  any derivative financial instruments 
in addition  we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in  and is expected to continue to be transacted in  us dollar based currencies
