item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
in addition  financial reporting release no 
was recently released by the sec to require all companies to include a discussion to address  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
general ampex s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon ampex s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires ampex to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of receivables and inventories and the adequacy of allowances for returns and doubtful accounts 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from days to one year 
the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we can not guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivables and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as a result of continuing sales declines  data systems further wrote down it inventory by million in the fourth quarter of additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
deferred taxes ampex records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
warranty our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
pension and other postretirement benefits the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
the company s domestic employees participate in a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
in early  the company amended the plan to terminate benefit service and compensation credit accruals as of february  to the extent that there is an increase or decrease to the company s pension liabilities based on its annual actuarial valuation  ampex records the change directly to the minimum pension liability account  which is part of stockholders deficit 
the company remains the plan sponsor of a pension plan media plan although it disposed of the company media in november media is contractually required to provide funding for its obligations 
the company includes a nominal reserve in its liabilities for the media plan s unfunded status 
certain of the company s former employees of a closed foreign subsidiary were covered by a contributory pension plan 
the company includes a reserve in its liabilities for the plan s unfunded status based on an actuarial valuation 
valuation of long lived assets and investments we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets and investments for continued appropriateness 
this review is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
contingencies we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be over or understated 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this report 
licensing revenue and product groups the company s principal product groups are data systems mass data storage and instrumentation recorder products 
data systems mass data storage and instrumentation products group includes i millimeter scanning recorders and library systems dst and dis products and related tape and aftermarket parts  and ii data acquisition and instrumentation products primarily dcrsi instrumentation recorders and related tape and aftermarket parts 
other products consist principally of television aftermarket products that the company previously manufactured but still supports 
no other class of similar products accounted for more than of net sales during the comparison periods discussed below 
the following table shows licensing revenue and sales of data system s products by product group for the past three years 
in millions ampex corporation licensing revenue ampex data systems corporation mass data storage tape drives and library systems data acquisition and instrumentation recorders other total net product sales results of operations for the three years ended december  net product sales 
net sales decreased by to million in from million in  compared to million in in  the sales decline was experienced across all of data systems product lines 
in  the sales decline was primarily due to lower sales of instrumentation products  offset in part by greater data systems dst products 
in and  the majority of data systems sales of millimeter mass data storage libraries and tape drives were to government customers who use the product for imaging and intelligence gathering 
these sales fluctuate as a result of changes in government spending programs including defense programs  and seasonal procurement practices of government agencies 
data systems commercial customer base consists primarily of television broadcasters and production companies as well as the oil and gas industry 
the television market has declined in due to capital budget restrictions that have been imposed due to a depressed advertising market 
however  the company believes this market may represent its largest commercial opportunity for the sale of its dst product line for the next several years as broadcasters install digital archives for their content in order to achieve greater operational flexibility and efficiency 
in each of the past three years  government agencies and defense contractors have been the largest market for data systems mass data storage and instrumentation recorders 
this market has recently experienced an increase in activity as additional funding has been granted for intelligence gathering programs 
however  the company has no reason to believe that the increase in spending will continue beyond and future periods may well experience significant pressure to reduce spending 
the company s backlog of firm orders increased to million at december  from million at december  the company typically operates with low levels of backlog  requiring it to obtain the vast majority of each period s orders in the same period that they must be shipped to the customer 
historically  a small number of large orders has significantly impacted sales levels and often orders are received late in the quarter making it difficult to predict sales levels in future periods 
see business fluctuations in operating results  seasonality  backlog 
royalties 
royalty income was million in  million in and million in the company s royalty income derives from patent licenses 
the company receives most of its royalty income from licenses with companies that manufacture consumer video products such as vcrs and camcorders and  in certain cases  professional video tape recorders 
certain license agreements are scheduled to expire during and there can be no assurance that licensees will renew their license agreements 
also  in prior years  the company negotiated paid up license agreements with certain consumer product manufacturers 
in recent years  a significant portion of the company s royalty income stream has been based on patents covering analog and digital vcrs 
sales of analog vcrs are declining rapidly and several patents covering them are scheduled to expire in in order for the company to attain levels of royalty income realized in prior years  it will be necessary for it to successfully conclude licensing negotiations with manufacturers of digital camcorders  digital still cameras  dvds and or other consumer products 
the company s patents have historically not been licensed for use in many of these products and there can be no assurance that negotiations will be successful 
the company may be required to pursue litigation if its negotiations are not successful 
management believes that the expected increase in royalties from new digital products will not be sufficient to offset the expected decline in analog vcr royalties during at least the first six months of the company is assessing whether manufacturers of digital cameras  computer video games and dvd recorders are using its patented technology and has entered into preliminary discussions with certain manufacturers to license the company s patents for such use 
there can be no assurance that the manufacturers of these products are utilizing the company s technology or  if used  whether the company will be able to negotiate license agreements with the manufacturers 
royalty income has historically fluctuated widely due to a number of factors that the company cannot predict or control such as the extent of use of the company s patented technology by third parties  the materiality of any nonrecurring royalties received as the result of negotiated settlements for products sold by manufacturers prior to entering into licensing agreements with the company  the extent to which the company must pursue litigation in order to enforce its patents  and the ultimate success of its licensing and litigation activities 
in the fourth quarter of  the company received million of royalties for past use of its technology from a manufacturer of millimeter digital camcorders and will also receive ongoing payments 
the company is in licensing discussions with additional manufacturers of digital camcorders which the company believes use the same technology 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in negotiating additional licenses 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales were in  in and in the decline in gross profit percentage in was due to a greater percentage of sales represented by data systems sales of lower margin mass data storage systems versus higher margin instrumentation product sales and an overall decline in sales volume that resulted in lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
in addition  in the company provided a million reserve to write down the carrying value of inventory that its current sales forecast indicates may not be utilized during the next months 
further consolidation of manufacturing operations in colorado springs and certain restructuring actions in the second half of are expected to result in improved gross profit margins during however  the company has been notified that it may receive a substantial government order that provides for future tape and service revenue in exchange for a reduced equipment purchase price 
shipments against this order would result in depressed gross margins in to be recovered in tape and service margins in future years 
intellectual property costs 
intellectual property costs relate to those expenditures incurred by the company s in house patent department in procuring royalty income and expenditures associated with patent enforcement litigation 
the costs of patent litigation can be material  and the institution of patent enforcement litigation may also increase the risk of counterclaims alleging infringement by the company of patents held by third parties or seeking to invalidate patents held by the company 
see legal proceedings  below 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased to million of total revenue in from million of total revenue in and million of total revenue in selling and administrative costs declined in compared to and as a result of savings realized due to a reduction in headcount and relocation of certain administrative functions from redwood city  ca to colorado springs  co 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses represented  and of total revenue in  and  respectively 
the company does not capitalize any rd e expenditures 
the majority of rd e expenses in each of these years was incurred in completing the third generation dst product line and sustaining engineering on other products to enhance their price performance levels 
in recent years  the company has decreased the amount spent in research  development and engineering programs due to declining sales levels 
the company may be required to make additional cuts in r d spending if data system s sales continue to decline 
if this trend were to continue  the company s ability to develop new competitive products and renew its portfolio of licensable technology in future years would be adversely affected 
restructuring charges credits 
the company recorded a net restructuring charge with respect to its continuing operations of million in and million in the charge in included million in connection with the company s elimination of positions in engineering  manufacturing and administration in redwood city  ca and colorado springs  co all of whom were terminated as of year end 
in the fourth quarter of  the company consolidated its activities in redwood city  ca and vacated one administrative building 
the restructuring reserve at december  includes future rentals  net of estimated sublet income  associated with this property and the write off of leasehold improvements for million 
in  data systems relocated substantially all of its dcrsi manufacturing operations from redwood city to colorado springs  and eliminated positions in manufacturing and engineering 
during  the company paid million related to employee termination benefits and lease costs of abandoned facilities 
the remaining balance of accrued restructuring costs at december  will substantially be paid in the company evaluates the amount of accrued restructuring costs  including projected sublet income  on a quarterly basis  and may make additional adjustments in future periods if it determines that its actual obligations will differ significantly from remaining amounts accrued 
operating income loss 
the company reported an operating loss of million in in and  the company reported operating income of million and million  respectively 
the operating loss in was primarily due to the decline in sales of data systems products  a write down in inventory carrying values for potentially surplus material and a charge of million for restructuring of continuing operations 
interest expense 
interest expense increased between the comparison periods due to the issuance of senior discount notes in november that raised million of net proceeds and that has accreted in value to million at december  the company is seeking to refinance up to million of the senior discount notes from a conventional mortgage or sale and leaseback of its colorado springs  co facility  but no commitments or agreements from any lender have been received at the date of this report 
the company anticipates that interest expense may increase in fiscal reflecting increases in the outstanding amount of notes and additional borrowing from hillside 
amortization of debt financing costs 
these amounts reflect periodic amortization of financing costs over the remaining terms of the debt 
financing costs associated with the january issuance of the senior notes are being charged to expense over five years 
interest income 
interest income is earned on cash balances and short and long term investments 
lower interest income in and from levels realized in resulted from lower rates and significantly lower investment balances in those periods 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from the company s foreign operations 
in  other income included the value of the settlement of certain litigation between the company and a shareholder of a former internet investment 
provision for income taxes 
the provisions for income taxes in  and consisted primarily of foreign income taxes and withholding taxes on royalty income 
the company was not required to include any material provision for us federal income tax in any of the last three fiscal years due to the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and timing differences 
at december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes of million  expiring in the years through as a result of financing transactions that were completed in and  the company is limited in the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that can offset consolidated federal taxable income in a given year 
the company derives pretax foreign income from its international operations  which are conducted principally by its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  the company s royalty income is subject  in certain cases  to foreign tax withholding 
such income is taxed by foreign taxing authorities  and the company s domestic interest and amortization expenses and operating loss carry forwards are not deductible in computing such foreign taxes 
loss from discontinued operations and loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
in february  the board of directors of the company authorized management to close micronet  its wholly owned subsidiary that made high performance disk arrays and storage area networks  and to establish a reserve of million for the costs of closure and to write off its investment of million as of december  ampex transferred micronet assets to an entity that distributed the asset sale proceeds to micronet creditors 
through december   the company paid and charged million against the restructuring reserve 
during  the company entered into sublease agreements that reduced its estimated future lease costs by million which was recognized as income from discontinued operations 
the remaining balance of the micronet reserve totals million which represents estimated lease payments in excess of sublease income expected to be paid out over the lease term which expires in  and is included in its net liabilities of discontinued operations 
this obligation has not been discounted to present value 
a summary of the operating results of micronet are as follows years ended december  in thousands revenues   costs and operating expenses excluding amortization   goodwill amortization   operating loss   income loss from discontinued operations   in july  the board of directors of the company authorized management to close inextv s operations in new york city and to cease future funding its other internet based affiliates  aentv in los angeles and tvde in munich  germany 
the company established a reserve to write down its investment to net realizable value and to provide for the costs of closure at the end of the quarter ended june  a summary of the loss on disposal of inextv are as follows years ended december  in thousands impairment charge  provision for closure  loss on disposal of discontinued operations  the impairment charge represents the write down of the company s investment in its internet video businesses  including an additional investment in tv during the first quarter of of million  to estimated net realizable value 
the net liabilities of inextv reflected on its balance sheet after the impairment charge  together with the provision for closure costs  are included in the net liabilities of discontinued operations 
the provision for closure costs includes future payments to be made over a seven year period for facility rental commitments and related costs of million  employee and contractor severance costs of million and other costs of million 
in addition to the reserve for closure  the net liabilities of discontinued operations for inextv included the reclass of certain liabilities at the time of closure of million 
during  the company paid and recorded charges of million against the net liabilities of discontinued operations 
the unamortized balance in the net liabilities of discontinued operations totaled million at december  a summary of the operating results of inextv are as follows years ended december  in thousands revenues   costs and operating expenses excluding amortization    goodwill amortization and writedown of assets   operating loss    equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary loss from discontinued operations    internet revenues in were principally from webcasting  video production and event marketing services  substantially all of which were provided by the company s subsidiary  tv onthe web  which the company ceased funding in october in and  tv onthe web reported a net loss of million and million  respectively 
net loss 
the company reported a net loss of million in  million in and million in  primarily as a result of the factors discussed above under loss from discontinued operations and loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
benefit from extinguishment of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
the company issued shares of common stock valued at per share to satisfy its redemption obligation on the redeemable and convertible preferred stock  which was higher than fair value per share of common stock 
as a result  the company recorded a benefit available to common stockholders in the year ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively  representing the difference between the fair value and per share for the number of shares issued  on the consolidated statements of operations 
liquidity and capital resources 
general 
as a result of continuing losses  the company s liquidity has declined materially in recent years 
in response  the company has been required to restructure and extend the maturity date of its long term senior debt  to discontinue unprofitable internet video operations and to borrow funds from a former affiliate in order to make required contributions to its employee retirement pension plans 
the company has also significantly restructured and down sized the operations of data systems and borrowed funds for working capital purposes 
management believes that these actions  coupled with anticipated royalty collections under licensing agreements presently in effect  should be sufficient to satisfy all projected cash obligations for at least the next months 
recent senior debt restructurings 
in the first quarter of  the company completed certain previously announced restructurings of its outstanding senior notes due and data systems senior discount notes due march   which are the company s principal senior debt obligations 
the senior notes were exchanged for new notes due and the due date of the senior discount notes was extended to the restructured notes are secured by liens on the company s royalty stream that may be generated from existing and future patent licenses and  in addition  the senior discount notes are secured by a deed of trust on data systems manufacturing facility in colorado springs  co 
and are guaranteed by the company 
the new securities provide for the payment of accrued interest and principal out of available cash flow of the company  which includes all future royalty proceeds received by the company  net of withholding taxes  pension payments and specified operating expenses  as well as the proceeds of certain potential asset sales  less a working capital reserve of up to million 
the company is required to generate a minimum of million of available cash flow during the three years ending december  or an event of default will occur under the senior note indenture 
prior to maturity  the new notes are payable as to accrued interest and principal solely to the extent of available cash flow including certain potential asset sales received by the company  and unpaid accrued interest will be payable through the issuance of additional notes or capitalized 
the security interest in royalty payments granted to the new senior noteholders is subordinated to the security for the senior discount notes and no cash payments on the senior notes may be made until all payments of interest and principal have been made on the senior discount notes 
all payments due at maturity on the notes must be made in cash 
management believes that these restructurings have improved the company s financial position by deferring significant debt repayments which would otherwise have been due in and and by limiting the amount of cash payments required to be made on the restructured note prior to maturity to the actual amount of available cash flow received by the company 
however  application of available cash flow to debt service will substantially restrict the amount of cash flow available for investment in the company s operations and facilities or other corporate purposes 
the indentures under which the senior notes and the senior discount notes were issued contain customary affirmative and negative restrictive covenants that limit the payment of dividends  the incurrence of additional indebtedness or liens  certain sales of assets and other actions by the company and restricted subsidiaries 
in the event of default  the holders of the notes would be entitled to enforce the liens granted by the company on its future patent royalty stream and the colorado springs facility and to apply amounts collected to repayment of the notes 
cash flow 
the decline in cash and short term investments in and from levels at december  resulted primarily from operating losses of the company s internet video businesses and operations of the internet technology group that have been closed as of june  data systems used cash in its operating activities totaling million in and million in and generated cash from operating activities totaling million in discontinued operations used cash totaling million in  million in and million in pursuant to an agreement between the company  hillside capital incorporated  hillside and certain other parties  dated november   hillside is obligated to fund pension contributions in the event the company is unable to do so 
at the company s request  hillside has made three pension contributions totaling million through december   and has been issued notes by the company in the amount of the pension contributions 
under the terms of the notes  accrued interest is payable quarterly  a principal payment of  is due on the first anniversary of each note  wtih the remainder due on the fourth anniversary of the notes 
the notes are secured by a lien on data systems inventories 
the company anticipates that additional pension payments to be funded by hillside in fiscal may total approximately million  but this amount may vary based on future actuarial valuations 
ampex has reduced headcount and overhead expenses during in order to operate at a cash breakeven level at current sales levels  and recorded a restructuring reserve of million in connection with its cost reduction initiatives 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reserved for the cost of future lease commitments  less estimated sublet income  for an administrative building that has been vacated 
in october  data systems entered into a revolving credit agreement providing for borrowings of up to million  secured principally by the borrower s inventories 
the company has guaranteed all borrowings 
the facility is expected to be repaid in full on march  and it is not expected that it will be renewed or replaced 
management s current projections indicate that data systems should generate sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations over at least the next twelve months 
the company has available  through a subsidiary  a working capital facility that allows it to borrow or obtain letters of credit totaling million  based on eligible accounts receivable  through may at december   the company had borrowings outstanding of million and had letters of credit issued against the facility totaling million 
at december   the company had borrowings outstanding of million and had letters of credit issued against the facility totaling million 
the facility is scheduled to expire in may the company is seeking to obtain a new million accounts receivable line of credit that it believes will be adequate to deal with its currently foreseen seasonal cash flows 
if the accounts receivable facility is not replaced or extended  data systems will be required to implement alternative cash conservation strategies 
an aggregate listing of the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is as follows payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years senior debt a    other debt b  capital lease obligations operating leases c      other long term obligations d      a the maturity date of the senior discount notes is january and the maturity date of the senior notes is august pursuant to these agreements  substantially all available cash flow is to be applied first to the senior discount notes in full repayment of principal and accrued interest and second to the senior notes in full repayment of principal and accrued interest 
accordingly  payments due on these obligations could vary from the amounts shown in the table 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
b other debt includes hillside notes payable 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
c operating leases include facility rentals of discontinued operations or abandoned leaseholds which the company is attempting to sublease 
amounts shown above  exclude projected sublease rental income which the company has included in establishing reserves for the closure of discontinued operations or reserve for restructuring 
d other long term obligations include estimated pension contributions for the ampex corporation employees retirement plan based on actuarial assumptions presently in effect and an assumed rate of return on pension assets of per annum 
if interest rates decline  if the return on assets is less than projected or the actuarial assumptions change  future pension contributions could increase over amounts shown above 
hillside is contractually obligated to advance the company funds sufficient to make its pension contributions if the company does not have the ability to do so 
contributions due to the media plan are excluded from the above schedule since media is primarily obligated to make such contributions 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the other long term obligations also includes a foreign defined benefit plan  a foreign retirement allowance and domestic supplementary retirement plans which are included in the company s liabilities at million 
amount of commitment expiration per period less than after total year years years years lines of credit a   standby letters of credit b   a the company has a million line of credit collateralized by accounts receivable 
borrowings at december  totaled million and the largest outstanding amount during was million 
the facility is scheduled to expire in may the company is seeking to replace this facility with a million line of credit collateralized by accounts receivable but has not received any commitments regarding this facility to date 
data systems has a million short term inventory line of credit which is scheduled to expire by march   and is not expected to be renewed 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
b the company has obtained standby letters of credit from a bank to support its obligations under various building leases

in april  the staff of the american stock exchange amex notified the company that it would conduct a review of the company s eligibility for continued listing on the amex  and requested certain additional information and financial data concerning the company s business and financial condition 
the company submitted this information and in july the exchange informed the company that it would continue the company s listing pending a review of the september  form q  subject to continued monitoring of the company s public disclosures 
subsequently  the amex notified the company that it would continue its listing pending a review of the company s form k for recent pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
fas  business combinations  and no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supercedes apb  business combinations 
the provisions of fas are required to be adopted july  the most significant changes made by fas are requiring that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   establishing specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill  and requiring unallocated negative goodwill to be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain 
fas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition and supercedes apb  intangible assets 
the provisions of fas are required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning after december  the most significant changes made by fas are goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
the company has adopted fas effective july  which will result in the company accounting for any business combination consummated on or after that date under the purchase method of accounting 
the company will also apply the non amortization provisions of fas for any business combination consummated on or after july  the company will adopt fas effective january  at december  there was no goodwill and goodwill amortization on the company s financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
the standard is effective for the company is currently reviewing the requirements of this new standard and has not yet determined its impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes statement no 
fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and certain provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business 
fas requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations  be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
as a result  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
fas also broadens the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity that can be distinguished and eliminated from the rest of the entity s ongoing operations 
the provisions of fas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently reviewing the requirements of this new standard and has not yet determined its impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in february  the emerging issues task force eitf issued statement d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
this standard requires entities to record out of pocket expenses recharged to their customers as revenue 
the standard is effective for  with reclassification of prior periods 
the company is currently reviewing the requirements of this new standard and has not yet determined its impact in the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio generally has been comprised of us treasury bills 
these securities mature within one year and are classified as available for sale in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
at december  the company did not hold any investments 
the company did have a number of cash and cash equivalent accounts whose return varied directly proportionally to us interest rates 
a decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the current year financial condition or results of operations 
the company has a revolving credit line with a domestic financial institution to finance data systems working capital requirements 
the company s domestic revolving credit agreement permits borrowings up to million  based on eligible accounts receivable as defined in the agreement  less a standby letter of credit facility in the amount of million 
average borrowings under these agreements during both and were less than million at an average interest rate of and  respectively 
maximum borrowings outstanding at any time during and were million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had borrowings outstanding of million and had letters of credit issued against the facility totaling million 
if a increase in interest rates were to occur at january  and remain in effect throughout  and the balance remained the same  interest expense and cash outflow would increase by less than  foreign currency exchange rate risk 
certain of the company s licensing agreements are denominated in foreign currencies
