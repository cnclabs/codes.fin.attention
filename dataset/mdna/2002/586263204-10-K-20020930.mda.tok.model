item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations years ended june  and june  revenues 
in the past several years  the company has focused on increasing the amount of value added products it provides to the marketplace  ie  products where additional processing is performed on basic nitinol wire  strip  or tube before it is shipped to the customer 
currently  medical device applications represent some of the best opportunities for increasing the amount of value added business 
the kink resistant and self expanding properties of nitinol have made peripheral stenting an area of special interest  and stent components manufactured for abdominal aortic aneurysms aaa in particular have become a significant driver of the company s revenue 
however  because the market for stent components is very dynamic and rapidly changing  the company has found it difficult to accurately forecast demand for its stent components 
delays in product launches  uncertain timing on regulatory approvals  inventory adjustments by our customers  market share shifts between competing stent platforms and the introduction of next generation products have all contributed to the variability in revenue generated by shipments of medical stent components 
revenues increased for the fiscal year ended june   to  from  for the fiscal year ended june   a net increase of  this increase is primarily due to a significant increase in sales of superelastic tube  utilized for medical applications 
superelastic tube sales increased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal this higher level of tube sales was primarily due to increased demand in several medical device procedural areas  particularly embolic protection  neurological  and orthopedic 
as noted above  the kink resistant and self expanding properties of nitinol have made peripheral stenting an attractive market for the company at this time

in looking forward to fiscal year  notwithstanding the difficulties in forecasting stent component revenue noted above  the company anticipates that sales of wire based medical stent components will be a significant source of potential revenue growth during fiscal the company s agreement with united states surgical uss expires by its terms on september   but the company anticipates continuing to supply uss with products pending the execution of a three year extension of the agreement that is currently being negotiated

the company intends to use available cash from operations and authorized but unissued common stock to finance any such acquisitions 
the company does not currently  however  contemplate any material acquisitions for fiscal the company has substantial requirements to fund plant and equipment projects to support the expected increased sales volume of sma and superelastic materials during the fiscal year ending june  and beyond 
the company expects that it will be able to pay for these expenditures through a combination of existing working capital surplus  cash flow generated through operations and increased borrowings 
the largest risk to the liquidity of the company would be an event that caused an interruption of cash flow generated through operations  because such an event could also have a negative impact on the company s ability to access credit 
the company s current dependence on a limited number of products and customers represents the greatest risk to regular operations 
in connection with a december subordinated debt financing  the company granted connecticut innovations  incorporated cii  at the time the holder of both common stock and warrants of the company  a put right if at any time before the earlier of june  and the date on which cii ceases to hold at least of the common stock underlying the convertible securities originally issued to it  the company ceases to a maintain its corporate headquarters and all of its product business operations in the state of connecticut including the assembly of all products to be sold to us surgical corporation  excluding the company s components and sub assembly business acquired from raychem  b base its president and chief executive officer  a majority of its senior executives  and all of its administrative  financial  research and development  marketing and customer service staff relating to its product business subject to the same inclusions and exclusions as clause a in the state of connecticut  c conduct all of its operations relating to its product business directly or through subcontractors and through licensed operations in the state of connecticut subject to the same inclusions and exclusions as clause a  and d maintain its principal bank accounts with banks located in the state of connecticut provided  however  that assets  revenues  employees  operations and bank accounts attributable to any entity acquired by the company shall not be considered when determining if the company has satisfied such requirements so long as such entity was acquired in an arm s length transaction  was not an affiliate of the company and was not controlled by an affiliate of the company prior to such acquisition  and had been in existence and operating as a business for at least one year at the time of the acquisition 
upon cii s exercise of its put  the company shall be obligated to purchase from cii all the company s common stock then owned by cii and underlying warrants then owned by cii at a price equal to the greater of the then current market price of the company s common stock or per share  less  in either event  the aggregate amount of unpaid exercise prices of all warrants put to the company by cii 
using as the put price per share  which exceeds the market price for the company s common stock on june   the aggregate put price that would have to be paid by the company if the put were exercised would be approximately million 
to the extent that the current market value of the company s common stock exceeds per share at any time  the put price would be greater 
if cii were to have the right to put its securities and were to choose to exercise that right  it would have a serious adverse effect on the company s liquidity and the company would most likely have to seek equity financing to be able to meet its obligations to cii 
however  the company believes that it has the ability to ensure that its operations do not move from connecticut in a manner that would trigger cii s put 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  the company relocated to a facility located at berkshire blvd  bethel  ct  to house the company s corporate headquarters and east coast manufacturing and assembly operation 
the leased facility consists of 
table of contents approximately  square feet of manufacturing and office space located in a suburban industrial park 
the total cost of leasehold improvements  furnishings  and moving expenses associated with the new facility was approximately  the annual rent for the facility is approximately  versus the rent at the prior brookfield location of approximately  for  square feet 
on november   the company amended its lease for its manufacturing and office facility located at campbell avenue  menlo park  ca 
the lease  originally scheduled to end in march  was extended until september  under the terms of the amended lease  the company will continue to pay a monthly base rent of approximately  through march  and subsequent to that date  the monthly base rental shall be modified to reflect changes in the consumer price index 
the other major provisions of the lease remain unchanged 
in addition to funding normal operations  the company may be required to secure new facilities to house its west coast operations during the next two fiscal years 
the cost of this move and associated relocation expenses would be substantial  however the company believes that the combination of its borrowing facility and cash flow generated through operations will be sufficient to meet the company s total capital requirements 
if funds available through these sources were not sufficient  then the company would likely be forced to raise equity capital which could have a material adverse effect on the per share market price of the company s common stock
