the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  manufacture  sell and support a broad line of products for plastic card personalization and data encoding 
in february  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of  before offering expenses 
we used the proceeds of the offering to repay debt and redeem our redeemable preferred stock 
for more information about the use of proceeds from the offering  see note to our financial statements beginning on page f results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain selected financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative acquisition related costs total operating expenses operating income comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in the mix of net sales continued to change with sales of plastic card personalization products increasing to million in from million in sales of products not related to plastic card personalization decreased to  in from  in of the million in sales attributable to plastic card personalization products in  sales of equipment increased to million from million in  and sales of supplies increased to million from million in the increase in sales of equipment is largely attributable to shipment of printers for the department of defense common access identification card project 
the increase in sales of supplies was the result of increased unit volume of ribbons 
international sales increased to million in from million in and accounted for of net sales in compared to of net sales in the decrease in international sales as a percent of total sales was principally due to the increase in sales in the united states from the shipment of printers to the department of defense for the year ended december  we experienced increased international sales in canada  primarily the result of increased sales of equipment 
this increase in international sales was partially offset by decreased sales in asia pacific 
asia pacific sales were lower mainly due a decrease in sales of equipment 
our now terminated agreement to be acquired by zebra technologies corporation was announced on july  we believe that the announcement of the acquisition and the delay in the consummation of the transaction  which was terminated on march   due to the hart scott rodino antitrust review has had  and will likely continue to have  an adverse effect on our distributorship and reseller arrangements and  consequently  our sales 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for from million in several factors  however  led to a decline in the gross profit margin percent to in from in  notably  increases in manufacturing start up costs associated with our new products  increased discounts and increased sales of lower margin printers in lower material costs on supplies partially offset these negative factors

selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in  compared to in the dollar increase is principally attributable to additional legal and professional fees  which include fees paid to outside consultants to improve our manufacturing processes 
these increases in fees were partially offset by lower marketing trade show and marketing program expenses

gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease was primarily due to manufacturing start up costs related to our new products  an unfavorable change in the exchange rate on the japanese yen versus the us dollar which increased our purchasing costs  increased discounts and increased sales of lower margin printers as a percentage of the total printers sold in the yen impacts our gross margin since we purchase our ribbons from japanese suppliers 
in  we began purchasing ribbons from our japanese supplier in us dollars 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were for compared to for the increase in was primarily due to the continued development of our new high definition printing hdp and direct to card dtc product lines and other new plastic card personalization technologies  and increased payroll expense

selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in  compared to in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was principally attributable to additional marketing expenses to promote our new products and increases in personnel expenses for payroll and benefits

interest expense totaled million in compared to million in upon completion of the initial public offering of our common stock in february  million of the offering proceeds were used to reduce our outstanding debt 
this reduction in our debt contributed to the lower interest expense  although the decrease was partially offset by higher interest rates 
we also refinanced our then outstanding senior bank debt with a revolving credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was in as compared to in extraordinary loss 
in connection with our initial offering of common stock in february of  we recorded an extraordinary loss  net of tax  of  for the write off of deferred financing costs related to the pay down of senior bank debt

income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in  which results in an effective tax rate of  compared to income tax expense of million and an effective tax rate of in liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations  debt service and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations 
working capital was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
our current ratio was   and  at december    and  respectively 
our working capital and current ratio declined in from because a significant portion of long term debt became current debt in cash generated from operating activities in totaled million due to net income of million and non cash charges of million primarily for deferred income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
decreases in inventories of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million also contributed to an increase in cash provided by operating activities 
the decrease in inventories is primarily due to management initiatives in focused on inventory reduction and also due to increased product shipments 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is mainly due to the timing of purchases and increased revenue activity relative to the fourth quarter of these cash flows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million primarily related to the timing of sales 
cash used by investing activities was  exclusively for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash used in financing activities was million primarily due to payments on our credit facility 
cash generated from operating activities in totaled million due to net income of million and non cash charges of million for deferred income taxes  extraordinary items  depreciation and amortization and the provision for obsolete inventories 
these cash flows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventories of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily related to the timing of sales and the increase in inventories is primarily related to decreased product shipments in relation to forecasted product shipments 
cash used by investing activities was million primarily for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash used in financing activities was million primarily due to our initial public offering of common stock and payment on our notes payable bank and our revolving credit facility 
as of december   our borrowings consisted of million owed under the credit agreement with lasalle bank and harris bank 
in april  we amended our credit facility  which under the terms of the amendment  was converted to a million term loan  of which million was outstanding at december   and a million revolving credit facility  of which there was no outstanding balance at december  we have made debt payments of million for the year ended december  in february  we further amended our credit facility to extend the maturity date from april  to april  in addition  under the terms of the amended agreement  the interest rates charged on the balance outstanding under the credit facility were increased to the prime rate of interest plus a margin of 
to 
or libor plus a margin of to  based upon the maintenance of certain financial coverage ratios 
interest is payable within to days  as defined by the agreement 
the agreement calls for principal repayments of million per quarter  with the remaining balance due at maturity on april  the credit facility requires  among other things  the maintenance of specified financial ratios including fixed charge coverage and total debt to ebitda  as defined in the agreement  and restrictions on capital expenditures and the payment of dividends 
in connection with our now terminated acquisition by zebra technologies corporation  we incurred legal  professional  and investment banking expenses of million for the year ended december  we expect to incur additional legal  professional and investment banking expenses in as a result of the termination of this transaction in march  we may incur additional costs to rebuild our distribution channel  which may have a negative impact on our cash generated from operating activities 
we believe that funds generated from operations and funds available to us under our revolving credit facility agreement will be sufficient to finance our current operations and planned capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
recently issued accounting standards effective april   the company adopted financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for certain sales incentives 
in accordance with the eitf  the company has reclassified certain sales incentive expenses totaling  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  from selling  general and administrative expenses and shown them as a reduction of net sales 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and we adopted these standards effective january  all business combinations under sfas no 
are to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets upon their acquisition and how they should be accounted for after initial recognition 
sfas no 
states that an intangible asset with a finite useful life be amortized over the period the asset is expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the entity 
an intangible asset with an indefinite life is not to be amortized 
all intangible assets are subject to periodic impairment tests 
we have reviewed the requirements of these standards and determined that there is no impact on our financials statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation  an entity shall capitalize an asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for the fiscal years beginning after june  in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
deals with the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we are reviewing the requirements of sfas no 
and no 
 and we do not expect these standards to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
accounting policies we have disclosed the accounting policies that we consider to be significant in determining the amounts to be utilized for communicating our financial position  results of operations and cash flows in note to our financial statements included elsewhere herein 
in applying our accounting principles  management must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
as one would expect  the actual results or outcomes are generally different than the estimated or assumed amounts 
these differences are usually minor and are included in the financial statements by management as soon as they are known 
the individual estimates and assumptions generally do not involve a level of risk or uncertainty that would be material to the financial statements as a whole because  they generally are relatively immaterial in amount 
many of these estimates and assumptions relate to current assets and liabilities and  accordingly  given the relatively short operating cycle of the company  they are reviewed and updated frequently by our management 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that the company s financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  achievement of corporate growth objectives  changes in material costs  could not adversely impact the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
market risk is attributed to all market sensitive financial instruments  including long term debt 
interest rate risk under procedures and controls established by management  we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to hedge our exposure to interest rate risks 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions 
although we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties  this exposure is managed through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures and  to the extent possible  by restricting the period over which unpaid balances are allowed to accumulate 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by counterparties to these contracts  and no material loss would be expected from such nonperformance 
we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed  floating and variable rate debt 
to help manage borrowing costs  we may enter into interest rate swaps 
under these arrangements  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
we had no interest rate derivatives outstanding at december  and the fair value of interest rate derivatives outstanding at december   was not material 
a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates  upon which these contracts are based  would not cause these instruments to have a material impact on future earnings 
foreign currency risk we denominate all foreign sales in us dollars and do not hedge against currency fluctuations 
we purchase components and supplies from several japanese suppliers 
the strengthening of the yen versus the us dollar in caused the cost of these supplies to increase 
to date  currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition  but could in the future by causing our products to become less affordable or less price competitive than those of foreign manufacturers or by causing the costs of our material supplies to increase 
with the implementation of the agreement we made in february of with our supplier to purchase dye sublimation ribbons in dollars rather than in yen  we believe that we have reduced the risks of increased purchasing costs that would otherwise occur if the dollar weakens relative to the yen 
we have foregone the opportunity  however  to benefit from the full potential cost savings if the dollar strengthens relative to the yen 
equity price risk we do not generally invest in marketable equity securities 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  comprising approximately of our total assets 
accordingly  a sustained decrease in the rate of interest earned would not have a material adverse effect on our business
