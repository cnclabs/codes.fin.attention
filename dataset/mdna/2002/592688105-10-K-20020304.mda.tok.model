item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements 
overview we operate a global business  with net sales that are diversified by geographic region  product range and customer 
we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors  including the strength of our brand name and reputation  our comprehensive solution offering  the quality of our global sales and service network  our continued investment in product development  our pursuit of technology leadership and our focus on capitalizing on opportunities in developed and emerging markets 
while all of our businesses have significant strategic links in terms of technology or customer base  we have a geographically diverse business that serves customers in relatively healthy and stable end markets  including the pharmaceutical  biotech and food industries 
our financial information is presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
net sales in local currency increased in  in  and in the strengthening of the us dollar versus our major trading currencies reduced us dollar reported sales growth in each year 
net sales in us dollars increased in  in  and in in  we had local currency sales growth of in europe  in the americas and in asia and other markets 
we believe our sales growth over the next several years will come primarily from our solutions approach to the principal challenges facing our customer base 
these include the need for increased efficiency for example  in accelerating time to market for new products  achieving better yields  improving work processes and outsourcing non core activities  the desire to integrate information captured by instruments into management information systems  the drive for ever higher quality of our customers products and services  including the need to adhere to stringent regulatory and industry standards  and the move towards globalization in all major customer groups 
acquisitions are also an integral part of our growth strategy 
our acquisitions leverage our global sales and service network  respected brand  extensive distribution channels and technological leadership 
we are particularly attracted to acquisitions that leverage these attributes or increase our solutions capability for example  software acquisitions 
in addition  we continue to focus on the following end markets drug discovery  process analytics  food and drug packaging and transportation and logistics 
we increased our adjusted operating income gross profit less research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses before amortization and non recurring costs as a percentage of net sales from in to in this improved performance was achieved while we continued to invest in product development and in our distribution and manufacturing infrastructure 
we believe that a significant portion of the increase in our adjusted operating income resulted from our strategy to reduce costs  re engineer our operations and focus on the highest value added segments of the markets in which we compete 
we believe that adjusted operating income provides important financial information in measuring and comparing our operating performance 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our performance 
recent acquisitions we have completed several acquisitions in the last few years  including the following in november  we acquired rainin instrument  llc  based in california  usa 
rainin is the leading manufacturer of pipetting solutions used in pharmaceutical  biotech and medical research applications 
rainin has a market leadership position in north america  a truly differentiating technology and a broad patent portfolio in areas like electronic pipetting  ergonomic designs for pipettes and tip designs 
this acquisition further broadens our offering of instruments and solutions to the life sciences market and positions us to bring greater value to our customers 
assuming we acquired rainin as of the beginning of  the acquisition would have added additional sales of approximately million  adjusted operating income of approximately million  and diluted earnings per share of negative per share on a pro forma basis 
in  we acquired thornton inc based in massachusetts  usa 
thornton is the leader in pure and ultra pure industrial water monitoring instrumentation used in semi conductor  micro electronics  pharmaceutical  and biotech applications 
we believe the acquisition of thornton is an excellent strategic move to expand our process analytics business and gain access to new markets 
its conductivity technology and know how are complementary to our strength in ph and oxygen measurements 
with a broader technology offering  we are better able to serve our expanded customer base 
in  we acquired the testut lutrana group  a leading manufacturer and marketer of industrial and retail weighing instruments in france with annual sales of approximately million 
we believe this acquisition is an excellent strategic fit given testut lutrana s extensive sales and service network in france and excellent brand recognition 
by virtue of this acquisition  we assumed the leading position in food retail weighing in europe and are well positioned to meet the rapidly changing demands of our european customer base 
in  we also signed an agreement to convert our subsidiary in changzhou  china  into a legal structure that provides us with full control 
through this change in ownership  we are able to fully leverage this low cost manufacturing base for international markets 
this move underscores our strategic commitment to asia and our belief in the fundamental growth factors for the region 
since the time of its buy out in  the company has recorded charges in  and for purchased research and development for products that were being developed that had not established technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition and  if unsuccessful  had no alternative future use in research and development activities or otherwise 
these research and development projects related to several projects at the company at the time of its buy out  safeline metal detection projects and bohdan automation 
these purchased research and development projects have been completed  and there have been no material differences between actual and projected results 
assumptions taken at the time of these acquisitions continue to appear reasonable based upon actual results  and in no cases have there been significant shortfalls to the company s original projections 
cost reduction programs as further described in note to our consolidated financial statements  as part of our efforts to reduce costs  we recorded a charge in of million associated primarily with headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers 
in  we recorded a charge of million related to the close down and consolidation of operations 
in light of our intention to continue to develop china as a low cost manufacturing resource and to seek other manufacturing cost saving opportunities  we also recorded a charge of million in associated with the transfer of production lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities 
these charges relate primarily to severance and other related benefits and costs of exiting facilities  including lease termination costs and the write down of impaired assets  and are expected to be completed during the first quarter of during  we also exited our glass batching business based in belgium 
in this respect  we incurred losses of million during primarily for severance and other costs of exiting this business 
we completed our exit of the glass batching business by the end of as part of our ongoing cost saving programs  we have launched an initiative to improve our procurement of materials and services 
the initiative is intended to eliminate price differences between units  leverage potential opportunities to increase buying power  and establish worldwide sourcing arrangements 
we estimate that we are currently receiving annualized savings of between to million from this project 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands 
a net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    research and development    selling  general and administrative    amortization    interest expense    other charges  net b    earnings before taxes and minority interest    adjusted operating income c    a in connection with acquisitions in  including the acquisition of the testut lutrana group  we allocated of the purchase price to revalue certain inventories principally work in progress and finished goods to fair value net realizable value 
substantially all such inventories were sold during the second quarter of b other charges  net generally includes interest income  foreign currency transactions  gains losses from sales of assets and other items 
the amount also includes a charge of  related primarily to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers 
the amount includes a charge of  related to the close down and consolidation of operations 
the amount includes a gain on an asset sale of approximately  a charge of  to transfer production lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities and losses of approximately  in connection with the exit from our glass batching business based in belgium 
for the year ended december   the amount shown also includes of expenses incurred on behalf of certain selling shareholders in connection with our secondary offering in c adjusted operating income is defined as operating income gross profit less research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses before amortization and non recurring costs 
non recurring costs that have been excluded are the costs set forth in note a above 
we believe that adjusted operating income provides important financial information in measuring and comparing our operating performance 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our operating performance 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales were  million for the year ended december   compared to  million in the prior year 
this reflected an increase of in local currencies during results for were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies 
net sales in us dollars during increased 
net sales by geographic customer location were as follows net sales in europe increased in local currencies during versus the prior year principally due to strong results in our retail product lines related to the introduction of the euro currency  offset in part by a weakening in our industrial product lines during the second half of the year 
net sales in local currencies during in the americas increased 
net sales in asia and other markets increased in local currencies during the results of our business in asia and other markets during reflect particularly strong sales performance in china and japan 
net sales growth in the americas was lower than europe and asia and other markets primarily due to a deterioration in economic conditions 
to the extent that economic conditions significantly deteriorate in the americas or other parts of the world  our sales growth and profitability may be adversely affected 
as previously mentioned  we acquired rainin instrument in november assuming we had acquired rainin at the beginning of  the acquisition would have added approximately million of sales to both and on a pro forma basis 
in total  acquisitions added approximately to sales growth 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for and for this increase is primarily related to benefits from various cost saving initiatives 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were for  compared to for the prior year 
we continue to make significant investments in research and development  which increased in local currencies in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for  compared to for the prior year  in part due to lower distribution costs associated with changes in our sales mix 
adjusted operating income increased to million  or of net sales  for  compared to million  or of net sales  for the prior year 
the increased operating profit reflected the benefits of higher sales levels and our continuous efforts to improve productivity 
we believe that adjusted operating income provides important financial information in measuring and comparing our operating performance 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our performance 
interest expense decreased to million for  compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease was principally due to reduced debt levels throughout the year 
other charges  net were million for  compared to other charges  net of million for the prior year 
the amount includes a charge of million million after tax primarily associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers 
the amount includes a charge of million related to the close down and consolidation of operations 
our effective tax rate of before non recurring items in was consistent with the previous year 
net earnings were million in  compared to million in  before the previously mentioned charges associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers of million in and million in this represents an increase in net earnings of 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales were  million for the year ended december   compared to  million in the prior year 
this reflected an increase of in local currencies during results for were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies 
net sales in us dollars during increased 
net sales by geographic customer location were as follows net sales in europe increased in local currencies during  versus the prior year 
the increase reflected organic growth in our business and the effect of the testut lutrana acquisition 
net sales in local currencies during in the americas increased 
net sales in asia and other markets increased in local currencies during the results of our business in asia and other markets during reflect strong sales performance in china and japan 
the operating results for testut lutrana which were included in our results from may  would have had the effect of increasing our net sales by an additional million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for and  before non recurring acquisition costs in during  we experienced an increase in certain raw material costs  including electronics 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were for  compared to for the prior year 
this decrease is the result of exchange rate movements 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for  compared to for the prior year 
adjusted operating income increased to million  or of net sales  for  compared to million  or of net sales  for the prior year 
the period excludes the previously noted non recurring acquisition charge of million for the revaluation of inventories to fair value 
the increased operating profit reflected the benefits of higher sales levels and our continuous efforts to improve productivity 
we believe that adjusted operating income provides important financial information in measuring and comparing our operating performance 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our performance 
interest expense decreased to million for  compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease was principally due to reduced debt levels 
other charges  net were million for  compared to other charges  net of million for the prior year 
the amount includes a charge of million related to the close down and consolidation of operations 
the amount also included a gain on an asset sale of million  charges of million regarding the transfer of production lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities  losses of million to exit our glass batching business based in belgium and a charge of million relating to the secondary offering completed in our effective tax rate of before non recurring items in was consistent with the previous year 
net earnings were million in  compared to million in  before the million charge to close down and consolidate operations in  and expenses for the secondary offering  acquisition charges and the million charge to transfer production lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities in this represents an increase of 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities totalled million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in resulted principally from increased adjusted operating income and improved working capital management 
the decrease in from resulted principally from a one time payment of million associated with an early retirement plan from previous years  as well as an increase in inventory levels associated with product introductions  production transfers and increased safety stocks of electronics 
in  we also increased our accounts payable terms with many suppliers to improve our working capital efficiency 
this resulted in an increase in cash provided by operating activities of million in we maintained these payment terms in  and therefore  accounts payables were not a source of cash in cash provided by operating activities includes payments for restructuring  certain acquisition integration activities and a one time payment in associated with an early retirement plan from previous years 
these amounts totalled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
excluding these amounts  cash provided by operating activities totalled million in  compared to million in and million in during  we spent approximately million on acquisitions  including the issuance of shares of million and additional consideration related to earn out periods associated with acquisitions consummated in prior years 
the cash portion of these purchases were funded from cash generated from operations and additional borrowings 
we continue to explore potential acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition  we may incur additional indebtedness 
in addition  we may make additional earn out payments relating to certain of these and previous year acquisitions in the future  including up to million for rainin 
up to half of any additional contingent payment for rainin may be paid in shares of our common stock and the remainder will be paid in cash 
capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made primarily for machinery  equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities 
our capital expenditures totalled million in  million in and million in we expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows  and fluctuate as currency exchange rates change 
we also expect capital expenditures to increase between to million in principally due to spending associated with rainin s new facility in california  usa 
at december   our consolidated debt  net of cash  was million 
we had borrowings of million under our credit agreement and million under various other arrangements as of december  of our credit agreement borrowings  approximately million was borrowed as term loans scheduled to mature in and million was borrowed under a multi currency revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million of availability remaining under the revolving credit facility 
at december   approximately million of the borrowings under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated in us dollars 
the balance of the borrowings under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated in certain of our other principal trading currencies amounting to approximately million at december  changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity 
in addition  because we borrow in a variety of currencies  our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 
under the credit agreement  amounts outstanding under the term loans are payable in quarterly installments 
in addition  the credit agreement obligates us to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances with the proceeds of asset sales or issuance of capital stock or indebtedness and with certain excess cash flow 
the credit agreement imposes certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries  including restrictions and limitations on the ability to pay dividends to our shareholders  incur indebtedness  make investments  grant liens  sell financial assets and engage in certain other activities 
we must also comply with several financial and other covenants  including requirements that we maintain the following criteria as specifically defined in our credit agreement o a fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda less capital expenditures to interest expense of at december   this ratio was more than  o a debt to ebitda ratio of no more than at december   this ratio was less than  and o a minimum net worth as specifically defined in the credit agreement of at least million at december   we exceeded the minimum by more than times a deterioration in our financial performance could result in a breach of these covenants and trigger the lenders right to require immediate repayment of all or part of the indebtedness 
however at december   the company is in compliance with all covenants set forth in its credit facility and other indentures 
in addition  the company does not have any downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its debt 
the interest rates for our borrowings under the credit agreement are based in part on our credit rating 
for so long as standard poor s ratings services  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  inc  rates our debt at bbb or above and moody s investors service inc rates our debt at baa or above  the applicable interest rates are determined from a grid that sets out the interest rates for each rating grade 
however  if our credit rating falls below bbb or baa then the applicable interest rates are set by reference to a separate grid in which interest rate levels are determined by our debt to ebitda ratio 
we estimate that if our credit rating was reduced to below investment grade our interest expense would increase by approximately million per year 
the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 
during the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture 
in general these commitments do not extend for more than a few months 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt a    non cancelable operating leases b      total      a as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities  together with borrowings available under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities  will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements as well as debt service requirements for at least several years  but there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
effect of currency on results of operations because we conduct operations in many countries  our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
swiss franc denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss franc denominated sales represent of our net sales 
in part  this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland 
moreover  a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland 
therefore  if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg  the eg dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the japanese yen  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies 
therefore  when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc  it also decreases our operating profits 
in recent years  the swiss franc and other european currencies have generally moved in a consistent manner versus the us dollar 
therefore  because the two effects previously described have offset each other  our operating profits have not been materially affected by movements in the us dollar exchange rate versus european currencies 
however  there can be no assurance that these currencies will continue to move in a consistent manner in the future 
we estimate that a one percent strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of million to million on an annual basis 
in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits  our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
taxes we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world 
our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors  such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions  the tax rates in such jurisdictions  tax treaties between jurisdictions  the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and repatriate income  and changes in law 
generally  the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a non consolidated non combined basis or ii on a consolidated combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction  in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non consolidated non combined affiliated legal entities 
as a result  we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period 
environmental matters we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 
we incur capital and operating expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and abroad 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in facilities both in the united states and abroad 
in addition  some of these facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future 
such sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation 
accordingly  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 
inflation inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use 
the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 
moreover  there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products  which may limit our ability to recover increased costs 
we remain committed to operations in china  latin america and eastern europe  which have experienced inflationary conditions 
to date  inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results 
however  if our presence in china  latin america and eastern europe increases  these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 
seasonality our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation  with sales in the first quarter slightly lower than  and sales in the fourth quarter slightly higher than  sales in the second and third quarters 
this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge short term intercompany balances with our foreign businesses 
such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar and swiss franc on these foreign currency denominated contracts indicates that if the us dollar and swiss franc uniformly worsened by against all of our currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million at december   as compared with million at december  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
we also have other currency risks as described under effect of currency on results of operations 
we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates 
these contracts are more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
based on our agreements outstanding at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of million  as compared with million at december  conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a million net reduction in the net aggregate market value of these instruments  as compared with million at december  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the variable rate debt they hedge were prematurely settled 
we have designated certain of our swiss franc debt as a hedge of our net investments 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar on such debt at december  indicates that if the us dollar weakened by against the swiss franc  the fair value of such debt would increase by million  as compared with million at december  any changes in fair value of the debt are recorded in comprehensive income and offset the impact on comprehensive income of foreign exchange changes on the net investments they hedge 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  pensions and other post retirement benefits  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivables 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  reductions in the value of inventory may be required 
acquired intangibles 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas prospectively prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and also provides new criteria for recognizing acquired intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment under sfas upon initial adoption of the statement and on an annual basis going forward 
in addition  any goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed after june  is not amortized 
we estimate the adoption of these statements will increase our net earnings by million and our diluted earnings per share by per share on an annual basis  or per share adjusting for additional shares issued in connection with our acquisition of rainin 
we estimate the adoption of these statements would have had the following effects on our quarterly financial results for the year ended december  first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter total net earnings reported      goodwill amortization      adjusted      diluted earnings per share reported goodwill amortization adjusted sfas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step 
we expect to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of the company s fiscal year 
intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment using a one step process which compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year  and pursuant to the requirements of sfas will be completed during the first quarter of any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter we have not yet determined what effect these impairment tests will have on our earnings and financial position 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and amends accounting principles bulletin opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are disposed of by sales  based on the model previously developed in sfas this statement also makes changes to the manner in which amounts from discontinued operations are measured and expands the scope of the components of an entity that qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not fully evaluated the impact of adopting this statement on our consolidated financial statements
