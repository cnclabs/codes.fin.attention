item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design and sell amplifiers based on our proprietary digital power processing technology 
we currently supply amplifiers for audio electronics applications  and we have begun offering amplifiers for dsl applications 
we were incorporated in july  and we began shipping products in the first quarter of accordingly  we have limited historical financial information and operating history for use in evaluating our company and our future prospects 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million in  and million in we expect to continue to incur net losses in  and possibly beyond 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers and distributors 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to original equipment manufacturers and end users  net of sales returns and allowances 
our sales to distributors are made under arrangements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances and we defer recognition on sales to distributors until products are resold by the distributor to the end user 
all of our sales are made in us dollars 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we contract with third party semiconductor fabricators to manufacture the silicon wafers based on our ic designs 
each wafer contains numerous die  which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an ic 
we also contract with third party assembly and test houses to assemble and package our die and conduct final product testing 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers and die manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly and final product testing  as well as salaries and overhead costs associated with employees engaged in activities related to manufacturing 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related overhead costs associated with employees engaged in research  design and development activities  as well as the cost of wafers and other materials and related services used in the development process 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related overhead expenses and advertising and marketing expenses 
stock based compensation expense relates both to stock based employee and consultant compensation arrangements 
employee related stock based compensation expense is based on the difference between the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock and is being recognized on an accelerated basis over the vesting periods of the related options  usually four years  or in the case of fully vested options  in the period of grant 
consultant stock based compensation expense is based on the black scholes option pricing model 
future compensation charges will be reduced if any employee or consultant terminates employment or consultation prior to the expiration of the option vesting period 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  accruals  stock options  warrants  income taxes and restructuring costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
material differences may occur in our results of operations for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
revenue for was million  an increase of million or from revenue of million for this increase in revenue resulted primarily from increased shipments of our new watt channel ta product 
revenue for increased million or  from revenue of  in the increase in revenue from to resulted from increased shipments of our tab watt channel and ta watt channel products 
our top five customers accounted for of revenue in versus in our primary customers in were sony and apple  representing and of revenue  respectively 
sony and apple were also our top two customers in  representing and of revenue  respectively 
in we were able to offset the decline in revenue from sony with increased shipments related to design wins with existing and new customers 
the percentage of revenue to customers located outside of the united states was in and in gross profit loss 
gross profit for was million including stock based compensation benefit of  compared to a gross loss of million including stock based compensation expense of  for and a gross loss of million including stock based compensation expense of  for the increase in gross profit in was due to better product mix  including increased shipments of higher power higher margin products related to new design wins  as well as ongoing cost reduction efforts 
the gross loss in was due to the impact of price concessions made to komatsu for sales to sony corporation in order to accelerate the acceptance and introduction of one product in a new market segment 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses for were million including stock based compensation benefit of  a decrease of million or from r d expenses of million including stock based compensation expense of million in r d expenses for increased million or from r d expenses of million including stock based compensation expense of million in excluding stock based compensation expense  r d expenses increased million from to  driven by higher headcount related costs  as well as higher depreciation  rent  and insurance expenses 
the increase in r d expenses from to was primarily a result of increased staffing  increased product development expenses  and increased facility costs and expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for were million including stock based compensation expense of  a decrease of million or from sg a expenses of million including stock based compensation expense of million in sg a expenses for increased million or from sg a expenses of million in including stock based compensation expense of million 
excluding stock based compensation expense  sg a expenses were flat from to included a one time charge for forgiveness of stockholder notes receivable  which was offset in by higher headcount related costs and professional services expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses from to was due to increased headcount and salaries and due to the forgiveness of stockholder notes receivable 
restructuring and other charges 
on august   we announced a restructuring and cost reduction plan which included a workforce reduction and write off of abandoned assets 
as a result of the restructuring and cost reduction plan  we recorded restructuring and other charges of  during the quarter ended september  under the restructuring and cost reduction plan  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees across all functions and mostly located at our headquarters facility in santa clara  california 
the workforce reduction resulted in a  charge relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits 
we also abandoned assets for a charge of  a summary of the restructuring and other charges is as follows total charges non cash charges cash payments work force reduction   write off of abandoned assets   interest and other income  net 
interest income for was  a decrease of  or from interest income of million in interest income for increased  or from interest income of million in in  the decrease resulted from decreases in our average cash equivalents and short term investment balances to fund operations  together with lower interest rates 
in  the increase in interest income resulted from increases in our average cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from our initial public offering 
income taxes 
we have incurred no income tax expense to date 
as of december   we had available federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal and million for state purposes 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various times through as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  research and development tax credit carryforwards and nondeductible reserves and accruals 
we have recorded no tax benefit in our financial statements for these deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets will be recognized in future periods as any taxable income is realized and consistent profits are reported 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through the private sale of our equity securities  primarily the sale of preferred stock  including our most recent financing in january  and through our initial public offering on august  net cash used for operating activities during the years ended december    and  was million million  and million  respectively 
during these periods  cash used for operating activities consisted primarily of cash utilized to fund operating losses and for working capital 
our investing activities provided cash in the amount of million in from the net sale of short term investments  offset by the purchase of capital equipment 
in our investing activities used cash in the amount of million  for the purchase of short term investments and capital equipment 
in our investing activities produced cash in the amount of million  from the net sale of short term investments  offset by the purchase of capital equipment 
in our financing activities provided cash in the amount of million  derived from stock option exercises 
in our financing activities provided cash in the amount of million  the majority of which was derived from our initial public offering 
in our financing activities provided cash in the amount of million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock  exercise of stock options and from payment of a note receivable from a stockholder 
on january   we completed a financing in which we raised million in gross proceeds through a private placement of non voting series a preferred stock and warrants  at per unit to a group of institutional investors 
upon stockholder approval  each share of series a preferred stock will convert into shares of common stock or an effective common stock price of per share  subject to adjustment for stock splits  dividends and the like 
investors also received warrants to purchase up to an additional percent of shares of series a preferred stock 
the warrants have a term of three years and an exercise price equal to per share or an effective common stock exercise price of per share 
if the common stock trades at per share or greater for a period of out of trading days we can require the holders to exercise the warrants 
as a result of the favorable conversion price of the shares and related warrants at the date of issuance  we will have to record accretion relating to the beneficial conversion feature at the date of conversion which will result in a reduction of earnings available to common stockholders 
if we do not obtain stockholder approval for the conversion into common stock of the securities issued in the financing within days of the closing  the investors will have the right to require us to redeem the series a preferred stock at the original purchase price plus annual interest 
if investors elected to redeem their shares and we are unable to find additional financing to fund the redemption  we will have insufficient capital to continue to fund our operations 
without sufficient capital to fund our operations  we will no longer be able to continue as a going concern 
as a result of these circumstances  our independent accountants opinion on our consolidated financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we expect our future liquidity and capital requirements will fluctuate depending on numerous factors  including the cost and timing of future product development efforts  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  market acceptance of our existing and new products and the cost and timing of sales and marketing activities 
we believe that taking into account our recent financing in january  cost cutting measures and anticipated future burn rate  our existing cash and cash equivalent balances together with cash generated by our operations  if any  will be sufficient to take us to profitability 
however  we may need to raise additional capital in future periods through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements in order to grow our business 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
however  we cannot be certain that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed and on acceptable terms  we may not be able to achieve our business objectives and continue as a going concern 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb statements nos 
and fas and fas  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas replaces apb and eliminates pooling of interests accounting prospectively 
it also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill 
fas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under fas  goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
companies are required to adopt fas for fiscal years beginning after december   but early adoption is permitted 
the company will adopt fas on january  the company has not yet determined the impact these standards will have on its financial position and results of operations  although we do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be realized in the period which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
companies are required to adopt fas for fiscal years beginning after june   but early adoption is encouraged 
the company has not yet determined the impact this standard will have on its financial position and results of operations  although we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
fas 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas supercedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
this statement also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
companies are required to adopt fas for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  but early adoption is encouraged 
the company has not yet determined the impact this standard will have on its financial position and results of operations  although we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors risks related to our business if we do not obtain stockholder approval for the conversion into common stock of the securities issued in the financing we closed in january  the investors will be able to redeem their investment and we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
our stockholders are required to approve the conversion into common stock of the securities issued in the financing we closed on january  if they do not approve the conversion within days of the closing  the investors will have the right to redeem the shares they purchased for their purchase price plus three percent interest per annum 
if investors elected to redeem their shares and we are unable to find additional financing to fund the redemption  we will have insufficient capital to continue to fund our operations 
without sufficient capital to fund our operations we will no longer be able to continue as a going concern 
as a result of these circumstances  our independent accountants opinion on our consolidated financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our limited operating history and dependence on new technologies make it difficult to evaluate our future products 
we were incorporated in july but did not begin shipping products until many of our products have only recently been introduced 
accordingly  we have limited historical financial information and operating history upon which you may evaluate us and our products 
our prospects must be considered in the light of the risks  challenges and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in intensely competitive and rapidly evolving markets such as the semiconductor industry 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in addressing these risks and challenges 
we have a history of losses  expect future losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for year ended december  and million in and million in we expect to continue to incur net losses and these losses may be substantial 
furthermore  we expect to generate significant negative cash flow in the future 
we will need to generate substantially higher revenue to achieve and sustain profitability and positive cash flow 
our ability to generate future revenue and achieve profitability will depend on a number of factors  many of which are described throughout this section 
if we are unable to achieve or maintain profitability  we will be unable to build a sustainable business 
in this event  our share price and the value of your investment would likely decline 
we will likely need to raise additional capital to continue to grow our business 
because we have had losses we have funded our operating activities to date from the sale of securities  including our most recent financing in january we believe that  taking into account our recent financing and cost cutting measures and anticipated future burn rate  our existing cash and cash equivalent balances  together with cash generated by our operations  if any  will be sufficient to take us to profitability 
however  in order to grow our business significantly  we will likely need additional capital 
we cannot be certain that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
moreover  additional equity financing  if available  would likely be dilutive to the holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  would likely involve restrictive covenants 
if we cannot raise sufficient additional capital  it would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives and to continue as a going concern 
we must continue to reduce our costs and improve our margins in order to reach profitability 
the market for our products is extremely competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing 
as a result  margins in our market are often low 
traditionally  we have experienced low or even negative margins 
in order to reach profitability we must continue to increase our margins by reducing the cost of our products 
our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which may cause our share price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
the many factors that could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate include level of sales  mix of high and low margin products  availability and pricing of wafers  timing of introducing new products  including lower cost versions of existing products  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of products  and rate of development of target markets 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including salaries  rent and capital lease expenses  are fixed 
if we experience a shortfall in revenues relative to our expenses  we may be unable to reduce our expenses quickly enough to off set the reduction in revenues during that accounting period  which would adversely affect our operating results 
fluctuations in our operating results may also result in fluctuations in our common stock price 
if the market price of our stock is adversely affected  we may experience difficulty in raising capital or making acquisitions 
in addition  we may become the object of securities class action litigation 
as a result  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of future performance 
our customers may cancel or defer product orders  which could result in excess inventory 
our sales are generally made pursuant to individual purchase orders that may be canceled or deferred by customers on short notice without significant penalty 
thus  orders in backlog may not result in future revenue 
in the past we have had cancellations and deferrals by customers 
any cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in us holding excess inventory  which could seriously harm our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the end customer 
although we have not experienced customer refusals to accept shipped products or material difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  such refusals or collection difficulties could result in significant charges against income  which could seriously harm our revenues and our cash flow 
industry wide overcapacity has caused and may continue to cause our results to fluctuate and such shifts could result in significant inventory write downs and adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers 
we must build inventory well in advance of product shipments 
because the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and in light of the current downturn  which has resulted in excess capacity and overproduction  there is a risk that we will forecast inaccurately and produce excess inventories of our products 
as a result of such inventory imbalances  future inventory write downs may occur due to lower of cost or market accounting  excess inventory or inventory obsolescence 
in addition  any adjustment in our ordering patterns resulting from increased inventory may adversely affect our suppliers willingness to meet our demand  if our demand increases in the future 
our product shipment patterns make it difficult to predict our quarterly revenues 
as is common in our industry  we frequently ship more product in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  and shipments in the third month are higher at the end of that month 
this pattern is likely to continue 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter may cause our quarterly results of operations to be more difficult to predict 
moreover  if sufficient business does not materialize or a disruption in our production or shipping occurs near the end of a quarter  our revenues for that quarter could be materially reduced 
we rely on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue and a decrease in revenue from these customers could seriously harm our business 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues to date 
any reduction or delay in sales of our products to one or more of these key customers could seriously reduce our sales volume and revenue 
in particular  sales to solectron technology formerly natsteel electronics corp  a subcontractor for apple computer and komatsu semiconductor corporation  the purchasing agent for sony corporation and aiwa  accounted for and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december  and and  respectively  of total revenue in moreover  sales to our five largest customers represented approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december   of our revenue in and of our revenue in we expect that we will continue to rely on the success of our largest customers and on our success in selling our existing and future products to those customers in significant quantities 
we cannot be sure that we will retain our largest customers or that we will be able to obtain additional key customers 
we currently rely on sales of three products for a significant portion of our revenue  and the failure of these products to be successful in the future could substantially reduce our sales 
we currently rely on sales of our ta  ta and ta digital audio amplifiers to generate a significant portion of our revenue 
sales of these products amounted to of our revenue for the year ended december   of our revenue in and of our revenue in we have developed additional products and plan to introduce more products in the future but there can be no assurance that these products will be commercially successful 
consequently  if our existing products are not successful  our sales could decline substantially 
our lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if or when a sale will be made and to forecast our revenue and budget expenses  which may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results 
because of our lengthy sales cycles  we may experience a delay between increasing expenses for research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative efforts  as well as increasing investments in inventory  and the generation of revenue  if any  from such expenditures 
in addition  the delays inherent in such lengthy sales cycle raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product plans  which could result in the loss of anticipated sales by us 
our new products are generally incorporated into our customers products or systems at the design stage 
to endeavor to have our products selected for design into new products of current and potential customers  commonly referred to as design wins  often requires significant expenditures by us without any assurance of success 
once we have achieved a design win  our sales cycle will start with the test and evaluation of our products by the potential customer and design of the customer s equipment to incorporate our products 
generally  different parts have to be redesigned in order to incorporate our devices successfully into our customers products 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our products can range from a minimum of three to six months  and it can take a minimum of an additional six to nine months before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
achieving a design win provides no assurance that such customer will ultimately ship products incorporating our products or that such products will be commercially successful 
our revenue or prospective revenue would be reduced if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle  or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
the current downturn in the semiconductor industry has lead and may continue to lead to decreased revenue 
during  slowing worldwide demand for semiconductors has resulted in significant inventory buildups for semiconductor companies 
presently  we have no visibility regarding how long the semiconductor industry downturn will last or how severe the downturn will be 
if the downturn continues or worsens  we may experience greater levels of cancellations and or pushouts of orders for our products in the future 
we may experience difficulties in the introduction of new or enhanced products that could result in significant  unexpected expenses or delay their launch  which would harm our business 
our failure or our customers failure to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner would seriously harm our ability to generate revenues 
consequently  our success depends on our ability to develop new products for existing and new markets  introduce such products in a timely and cost effective manner and to achieve design wins 
the development of these new devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
the successful introduction of a new product may currently take up to months 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards  accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  achieving acceptable manufacturing yields  and market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  we might not be able to operate our business successfully 
we may not be successful in retaining executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
the competition for such employees is intense  particularly in silicon valley and particularly for experienced mixed signal circuit designers  systems applications engineers and experienced executive personnel 
a high level of technical expertise is required to support the implementation of our technology in our existing and new customers products 
in addition  the loss of the management and technical expertise of dr 
adya tripathi  our founder  president and chief executive officer  could seriously harm us 
we do not have any employment contracts with our employees 
our headquarters  as well as the facilities of our principal manufacturers and customers are located in geographic regions with increased risks of power supply failure  natural disasters  labor strikes and political unrest 
our headquarters is located in santa clara  california  an area on or near a known earthquake fault within the state 
in addition  businesses within the state of california are currently experiencing a shortage of available electrical power which has resulted in electrical blackouts 
in the event these blackouts continue or increase in severity  they could disrupt the operations of our facilities within the state 
our principal manufacturers and customers are located in the pacific rim region 
the risk of earthquakes in this region  particularly in taiwan  is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines 
earthquakes  fire  flooding and other natural disasters in the pacific rim region likely would result in the disruption of our foundry partners assembly and testing capacity and the ability of our customers to purchase our products 
labor strikes or political unrest in these regions would likely also disrupt operations of our foundries and customers 
in particular  there is a recent history of political unrest between china and taiwan 
any disruption resulting from such events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing  assembly and testing from the affected contractor to another third party vendor 
we cannot be sure that such alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
moreover  any such disruptions could also cause significant decreases in our sales to these customers until our customers resume normal purchasing volumes 
stockholders will incur additional dilution upon the exercise of warrants  and management will have sole discretion to use the proceeds received from exercise of these warrants 
to the extent that the warrants are exercised  there will be additional dilution to your shares 
if all of the warrants are exercised  we will be required to issue an additional  shares of common stock  or approximately of the common stock outstanding as of february  if all of the warrants are exercised in full  we would receive approximately million in proceeds 
our management will have sole discretion over use of these proceeds and may spend the proceeds in ways with which our stockholders may not agree 
the market may be adversely affected due to the large number of shares eligible for sale under the registration statement filed in connection with the financing 
the shares of common stock eligible for sale under the registration statement filed in connection with the financing represent a large percentage of our outstanding common stock 
the market for the shares may be adversely affected as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that large sales may occur 
we may not maintain nasdaq national market listing requirements to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market we are required to meet certain listing requirements  including a minimum bid price of per share 
if our stock is traded below the minimum bid price for consecutive business days  we will receive a deficiency notice and will have a grace period of calendar days to cure the deficiency by meeting the per share trading price for consecutive days 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the minimum bid price 
if we fail to meet the minimum bid price for consecutive days during the grace period our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
even if we are able to comply with the minimum bid requirement  there is no assurance that in the future we will continue to satisfy nasdaq listing requirements  with the result that our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
should our common stock be delisted from the nasdaq national market  it would likely be traded on the nasdaq small cap market  and if delisted from the nasdaq small cap market  would likely be traded on the so called pink sheets or the electronic bulletin board of the national association of securities dealers  inc consequently  it would likely be more difficult to trade in or obtain accurate quotations as to the market price of our common stock 
delisting of our common stock could materially adversely affect the market price  the market liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise necessary capital 
risks related to manufacturing we depend on two outside foundries for our semiconductor device manufacturing requirements 
we do not own or operate a fabrication facility  and substantially all of our semiconductor device requirements are currently supplied by two outside foundries  united microelectronics corporation  or umc  in taiwan and stmicroelectronics group in europe 
although we primarily utilize these two outside foundries  most of our components are not manufactured at both foundries at any given time 
as a result  each foundry is a sole source for certain products 
there are significant risks associated with our reliance on outside foundries  including the lack of guaranteed wafer supply  limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and control  manufacturing yields and production costs  and the unavailability of or delays in obtaining access to key process technologies 
in addition  the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and the installation and start up of new process technologies 
we provide our foundries with continuous forecasts of our production requirements  however  the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by the foundry s available capacity 
in many cases  we place our orders on a purchase order basis  and foundries may allocate capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing the deliveries to us on short notice 
in particular  foundry customers that are larger and better financed than us or that have long term agreements with our foundries may cause such foundries to reallocate capacity in a manner adverse to us 
if we use a new foundry  several months would be typically required to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry 
in the event either of our current foundries suffers any damage or destruction to their respective facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may not be able to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner 
even our current outside foundries would need to have certain manufacturing processes qualified in the event of disruption at another foundry  which we may not be able to accomplish in a timely enough manner to prevent an interruption in supply of the affected products 
if we encounter shortages or delays in obtaining semiconductor devices for our products in sufficient quantities when required  delivery of our products could be delayed  resulting in customer dissatisfaction and decreased revenues 
we depend on third party subcontractors for most of our semiconductor assembly and testing requirements and any unexpected interruption in their services could cause us to miss scheduled shipments to customers and to lose revenues 
semiconductor assembly and testing are complex processes  which involve significant technological expertise and specialized equipment 
as a result of our reliance on third party subcontractors for assembly and testing of our products  we cannot directly control product delivery schedules  which has in the past  and could in the future  result in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase the costs of manufacture  assembly or testing of our products 
almost all of our products are assembled and tested by one of five subcontractors ambit microsystems corporation in taiwan  st assembly test services ltd 
in singapore  amkor technology  inc in the philippines  ase in korea  malaysia and the philippines and ise labs assembly in the united states 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these suppliers and retain their services on a per order basis 
the availability of assembly and testing services from these subcontractors could be adversely affected in the event a subcontractor suffers any damage or destruction to their respective facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of assembly and testing capacity 
due to the amount of time normally required to qualify assemblers and testers  if we are required to find alternative manufacturing assemblers or testers of our components  shipments could be delayed 
any problems associated with the delivery  quality or cost of our products could seriously harm our business 
failure to transition our products to more effective and or increasingly smaller semiconductor chip sizes and packaging could cause us to lose our competitive advantage and reduce our gross margins 
we evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller semiconductor process technologies in order to reduce costs and have commenced migration of some products to smaller semiconductor processes 
we believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller semiconductor processes will be important for us to reduce manufacturing costs and to remain competitive 
moreover  we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to migrate to smaller semiconductor processes successfully 
we cannot be sure that our future process migrations will be achieved without difficulties  delays or increased expenses 
our gross margins would be seriously harmed if any such transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 
our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could harm our operating results 
we currently obtain almost all of our manufacturing  assembly and test services from suppliers located outside the united states and may expand our manufacturing activities abroad 
approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  was derived from sales to independent customers based outside the united states 
in and  and  respectively  of our total revenue was derived from sales to independent customers based outside of the united states 
in addition  we often ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
accordingly  we are subject to risks inherent in international operations  which include political  social and economic instability  trade restrictions and tariffs  the imposition of governmental controls  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  import and export license requirements  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in collecting receivables  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the cost of our overseas manufacturing  which would reduce our gross margins 
risks related to our product lines our ability to achieve revenue growth will be harmed if we are unable to persuade electronic systems manufacturers to adopt our new amplifier technology 
we face difficulties in persuading manufacturers to adopt our products using our new amplifier technology 
traditional amplifiers use design approaches developed in the s 
these approaches are still used in most amplifiers and engineers are familiar with these design approaches 
in order to adopt our products  manufacturers and engineers must understand and accept our new technology 
to take advantage of our products  manufacturers must redesign their systems  particularly components such as the power supply and heat sinks 
manufacturers must work with their suppliers to obtain modified components and they often must complete lengthy evaluation and testing 
in addition  our amplifiers are often more expensive as components than traditional amplifiers 
for these reasons  prospective customers may be reluctant to adopt our technology 
we currently depend on high end consumer audio markets that are typically characterized by aggressive pricing  frequent new product introductions and intense competition 
a substantial portion of our current revenue is generated from sales of products that address the high end consumer audio markets  including home theater  computer audio  and the automotive audio markets 
these markets are characterized by frequent new product introductions  declining prices and intense competition 
pricing in these markets is aggressive  and we expect pricing pressure to continue 
in the computer audio segment  our success depends on consumer awareness and acceptance of existing and new products by our customers and consumers in particular  the elimination of externally powered speakers 
in the automotive audio segment  we face pressure from our customers to deliver increasingly higher powered solutions under significant engineering limitations due to the size constraints in car dashboards 
in addition  our ability to obtain prices higher than the prices of traditional amplifiers will depend on our ability to educate manufacturers and their customers about the benefits of our products 
failure of our customers and consumers to accept our existing or new products will seriously harm our operating results 
if we are not successful in developing and marketing new and enhanced products for the dsl high speed communications markets that keep pace with technology and our customers needs  our operating results will suffer 
the market for our dsl products is new and emerging  and is characterized by rapid technological advances  intense competition and a relatively small number of potential customers 
this will likely result in price erosion on existing products and pressure for cost reduced future versions 
we are currently sampling and field testing our first product for the dsl market and we have not received any large volume orders 
implementation of our products require manufacturers to accept our technology and redesign their products 
if potential customers do not accept our technology or experience problems implementing our devices in their products  our products could be rendered obsolete and our business would be harmed 
if we are unsuccessful in introducing future products with enhanced performance  our ability to achieve revenue growth will be seriously harmed 
we may experience difficulties in the introduction of an amplifier product for use in the cellular phone market that could result in significant expenses or delay in its launch 
we are currently developing an amplifier product for use in the cellular phone market 
we currently have no design wins or customers for this product under development 
we may not introduce our amplifier product for the cellular phone market on time  and this product may never achieve market acceptance 
furthermore  competition in this market is likely to result in price reductions  shorter product life cycles  reduced gross margins and longer sales cycles compared with what we have experienced to date 
intense competition in the semiconductor industry and in the consumer audio and communications markets could prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability 
the consumer audio  personal computer  communications and semiconductor industries are highly competitive 
we compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of semiconductors in the audio and communications markets 
we also may face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than us 
as a result  such competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than us 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
in addition  existing or new competitors may in the future develop technologies that more effectively address the transmission of digital information through existing analog infrastructures at a lower cost or develop new technologies that may render our technology obsolete 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors  or that our business will not be harmed by increased competition 
our products are complex and may have errors and defects that are detected only after deployment in customers products  which may harm our business 
products such as those that we offer may contain errors and defects when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced such errors and defects  in particular in the development stage of a new product 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of such products  which could damage our reputation and seriously harm our ability to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers 
moreover  such errors and defects could cause problems  interruptions  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers 
alleviating such problems may require substantial redesign  manufacturing and testing which would result in significant expenditures of capital and resources 
despite testing conducted by us  our suppliers and our customers  we cannot be sure that errors and defects will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial production 
such errors and defects could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  product repair or replacement costs  claims by our customers or others against us  or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry and rapid technological change could result in substantial period to period fluctuations in wafer supply  pricing and average selling prices which make it difficult to predict our future performance 
we provide semiconductor devices to the audio  personal computer and communications markets 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to rapid technological change and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints 
as a result  we have experienced and may experience in the future substantial period to period fluctuations in our results of operations due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors  many of which are outside our control 
due to these risks  you should not rely on period to period comparisons to predict our future performance 
risks related to our intellectual property our intellectual property and proprietary rights may be insufficient to protect our competitive position 
our business depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies 
we cannot be sure that such measures will provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technologies and processes 
as of december   we have fourteen issued united states patents  and twenty two additional united states patent applications which are pending 
in addition  we have five international patents issued and an additional seventy three international patents pending 
we cannot be sure that any patent will issue as a result of these applications or future applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficient to protect our technology 
in addition  we cannot be sure that any existing or future patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any right granted there under would provide us meaningful protection 
the failure of any patents to provide protection to our technology would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products 
in connection with our participation in the development of various industry standards  we may be required to agree to license certain of our patents to other parties  including our competitors  that develop products based upon the adopted standards 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  services or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
in addition  effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
some of our customers have entered into agreements with us pursuant to which such customers have the right to use our proprietary technology in the event we default in our contractual obligations  including product supply obligations  and fail to cure the default within a specified period of time 
we may be subject to intellectual property rights disputes that could divert management s attention and could be costly 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we may receive in the future  notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
we cannot be sure that we will prevail in these actions  or that other actions alleging infringement by us of third party patents  misappropriation or misuse by us of third party trade secrets or the invalidity of one or more patents held by us will not be asserted or prosecuted against us  or that any assertions of infringement  misappropriation or misuse or prosecutions seeking to establish the invalidity of our patents will not seriously harm our business 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  an injunction could be issued against us requiring that we withdraw particular products from the market or necessitating that specific products offered for sale or under development be redesigned 
we have also entered into certain indemnification obligations in favor of our customers and strategic partners that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of our infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
irrespective of the validity or successful assertion of such claims  we would likely incur significant costs and diversion of our management and personnel resources with respect to the defense of such claims  which could also seriously harm our business 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
we cannot be sure that under such circumstances a license would be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
moreover  we often incorporate the intellectual property of our strategic customers into our designs  and we have certain obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of such intellectual property 
we cannot be sure that the steps taken by us to prevent our  or our customers  misappropriation or infringement of the intellectual property will be successful 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
some of the securities that we may invest in the future may be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates 
to mitigate this risk  we plan to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  which may include commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
currently  we are exposed to minimal market risks 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining a conservative portfolio  which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes
