critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are recognized when title to product passes to the customer  which generally occurs upon shipment to a customer location and  in the case of rental revenue and long term service contracts  is recognized ratably over the period the product is rented or services are performed 
from time to time  the company offers favorable sales arrangements to certain of its largest customers in exchange for volume purchase commitments 
these customers make such large purchases for a variety of reasons  including the desire to reduce shipping costs and to correspond to their own budgeting and purchasing cycles 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from health care product providers  distributors  and hospitals 
the company s customers are located throughout the united states and around the world 
a significant portion of products sold to providers  distributors  and hospitals  both foreign and domestic  is ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs or through private insurance programs 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on distributor and hospital liquidity and profitability 
in addition  because a concentration of market share exists in the homecare product industry in the united states among national and large regional providers  the company experiences a comparable concentration of credit risk with these customers 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on the company s evaluation of the payment pattern and financial condition of its customers 
in addition  the company is contingently liable  within certain limits  in the event of a customer default on unpaid installment receivables initiated by or transferred to several independent leasing companies in connection with customer leasing programs 
the company monitors the collection status of these installment receivables and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on the company s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
if it is determined that inventory on hand is in excess of estimated future usage and sales because of product obsolescence  changes in customer demand  or other reasons  additional inventory reserves may need to be provided 
the establishment of these additional reserves may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
intangible and product technology related assets intangible and product technology related assets are amortized to expense over their useful lives 
these useful lives are based on the company s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
intangible and product technology related assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable 
if such carrying amounts are determined to be unrecoverable because of changes in technology  extended delays in obtaining regulatory approval  competition  or other reasons  the carrying amounts may need to be adjusted 
these adjustments may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the significance of the carrying amounts and the extent of the required adjustments 
contingencies as a normal part of its business operations  the company incurs liabilities that may be difficult to quantify precisely  such as future warranty obligations  potential liabilities relating to legal or regulatory matters  and tax exposures 
the company follows the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  which dictate when a charge to income should be taken to accrue for a loss contingency 
these requirements necessitate the application of judgment regarding the likelihood and amount of the liability
