item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in an understanding of the company s historical financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
general the company s future results of operations and growth are substantially dependent upon i its ability to acquire or find and successfully develop additional oil and gas reserves and ii the prevailing prices for oil and gas 
at december   the company s proved reserves were comprised of approximately proved developed reserves 
if the company is unable to economically acquire or find significant new reserves for development and exploitation  the company s oil and gas production  and thus its revenues  would decline gradually as its reserves are produced 
in addition  oil and gas prices are dependent upon numerous factors beyond the company s control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from foreign and other sources of energy 
the oil and gas markets have historically been very volatile 
in particular  gas prices in the first quarter of were at the highest levels in the past five years  but experienced a sharp decline in the fourth quarter of any significant and extended decline in the price of oil or gas would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations  and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of the company s proved reserves and adversely affect its access to capital 
critical accounting policies the company s financial position and results of operations are materially effected by changes in oil and gas prices 
the company makes estimates of future oil and gas prices to determine the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
at december  the weighted average oil and gas prices used for impairment assessment purposes were per barrel and per mcf  respectively 
accordingly  a significant reduction in oil and gas prices used to estimate future oil and gas revenues for impairment purposes could materially impact impairment expense 
the company uses estimates of proved oil and gas reserve quantities to estimate depletion  depreciation and amortization expense using the unit of production method of accounting 
the estimates of proved oil and gas reserve quantities are also effected by estimates of future oil and gas prices along with various other reservoir engineering estimates 
accordingly  a significant reduction in oil and gas reserve quantities could materially impact depletion  depreciation and amortization expense 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  the capitalized costs of unproven properties are periodically assessed to determine whether their value has been impaired below the capitalized cost  and if such impairment is indicated  a loss is recognized in exploration expense 
the company makes these assessments based on estimates of future oil and gas prices and considers such other factors as exploratory drilling results  future drilling plans and the lease expiration terms when assessing unproved properties for impairment 
accordingly  any change in these estimates or factors could materially impact exploration expense 
the company enters into various hedging arrangements with respect to portions of its oil  natural gas and ngl production to achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce exposure to price fluctuations 
net income and cash flows from operating activities can be significantly effected by the company s hedging activities if oil and gas prices change significantly during the hedging period 
the company does not have any significant transactions with related parties 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires the company to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties and the costs of wells and related equipment and facilities on a property by property basis 
applying sfas no

gas sales for were million higher than with million of the increase attributable to the invasion acquisition 
the remaining million increase was due to higher average gas prices received in offset by lower gas production 
the average price received for gas sales in was per mcf  an increase of per mcf or from net gas production for was  mmcf  including  mmcf gas production from invasion 
excluding invasion  net gas production in was  mmcf  down  mmcf or from net gas production was down mmcf in the us primarily at the san juan  south texas and dimmitt slash ranch properties 
net gas production was down mmcf in canada excluding invasion primarily due to the sale of the pine creek  portage  groat  windfall and sunchild fields under the asset exchange agreement in june ngl sales for were million lower than due to both lower average prices received and lower production 
the average price received for ngl sales in was per barrel  a decrease of per barrel or from ngl production in was  barrels lower than due primarily to declining production at the wellman field and the sale of the pine creek  portage  groat  windfall and sunchild fields under the asset exchange agreement in june the company s hedging activities increased oil and gas sales by million in and reduced oil and gas sales in by million

net income loss available for common stock was million and basic net earnings per share was in compared to a net loss available for common stock of million and basic net loss per share of in liquidity and capital resources liquidity virtually all of the company s exploration expenditures and a significant portion of its development expenditures are discretionary expenditures that are made based on current economic conditions and expected future oil gas prices 
the company makes capital and exploration expenditures to develop and exploit existing oil and gas reserves as well as to acquire additional reserves through exploration or acquisition 
the company has significant flexibility in the timing of making capital expenditures on properties it operates and the company may also choose not to participate in capital expenditures on properties operated by others 
this flexibility allows the company to commit to annual capital and exploration levels that are based on expected cash flows from operating activities 
the company generally uses cash flows from operating activities as its primary source of funds for capital and exploration expenditures 
the company has also used borrowings under its credit facility to fund certain acquisitions and capital expenditures 
in june and may  the company also issued preferred stock to provide additional sources of liquidity 
the company s cash flows from operating activities are significantly effected by changes in oil and gas prices 
accordingly  the company s cash flows from operating activities would be significantly reduced by lower oil and gas prices  which would also reduce the company s capital and exploration expenditure levels 
lower oil and gas prices may also reduce the company s borrowing base under its credit facility and further reduce the company s ability to obtain funds 
in addition  changes in oil and gas prices may require the company to provide cash collateral under its hedging agreements which would also reduce its liquidity 
following is a summary of contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  s payments due by period total year years years years long term debt    capital lease obligations none operating leases less than more than enron bankruptcy enron corporation declared bankruptcy on december  and on december  enron owed the company million in unpaid settlements of its hedging contracts for the months of november and december in addition  the fair value of the company s forward hedging contracts for the year was million 
based on the uncertainty of collecting either of these amounts from enron  the company decided to write off the full amount of million at december  other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains of million on certain derivatives with enron which were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
these gains will be reclassified into oil and gas revenues over the original hedge period 
the company will continue to pursue collection of its claims against enron 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
cash flows operating cash flows in were million  up million from million in primarily as a result of increased oil and gas sales which were offset in part by higher production and operating expense  exploration expense and loss on derivatives 
cash flows from investing activities in included capital expenditures of million  up million from million in the major components of capital expenditures for were million for proved property acquisitions in canada  million for unproved property acquisition  million for development activities and million for exploration activities 
the major components of capital expenditures for were million for development activities  million for exploration activities and million for unproved property acquisitions 
the company s capital and exploration budget for is approximately million 
cash flows from financing activities in included million cdn million of borrowings under the company s credit facility and million of net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock in the wiser oil company june cash flows from financing activities in included million of net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock in may the company received million in net sales proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties during compared to million in proceeds received during financial position cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million at december  to million at december  the decrease was attributable primarily to an increase in capital expenditures  principally for the invasion acquisition 
working capital of million at december  was million lower than working capital of million at december  due primarily to decreased cash and cash equivalents of million 
net property and equipment increased million and total assets increased million during to million at december  stockholders equity increased million during to million at december  at december   capitalization totaled million and consisted of million of total debt and million of stockholders equity capital sources funding for the company s business activities has been provided by cash flow from operations  borrowings under the credit agreement and the issuance of preferred stock in june and may while the company regularly engages in discussions relating to potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties  the company has no current agreement or commitment with respect to any such acquisitions which would be material to the company 
any future acquisitions may require additional financing and will be dependent upon financing arrangements available at the time 
on may  the company entered into an million revolving credit facility revolver 
the aggregate borrowing base under the union revolver is million and is allocated million for general corporate purposes and million exclusively for acquisition of oil and gas properties 
the million aggregate borrowing base is also allocated million for canadian borrowings and million for us borrowings 
the aggregate borrowing base is re determined by the banks semi annually starting in april at december   the company had cdn million usd million of canadian borrowings outstanding and million was available primarily for us borrowings 
available loan and interest options are i prime rate loans  at the bank s prime interest rate  ii eurodollar loans  at libor plus  or depending on the percentage of the borrowing base actually borrowed by the company  iii canadian prime rate advances  at the canadian bank s prime interest rate  and iv canadian banker s acceptances  at the canadian drawing fee rate 
the average interest rate during under the revolver was 
the commitment fee on the unused borrowing base is 
the revolver imposes certain restrictions on sales of assets  payment of dividends  incurring of indebtedness and requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
under the revolver  there is no requirement to maintain restricted cash balances after may  the company believes that cash flows from operations and borrowings under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated capital and exploration expenditure requirements excluding any material property acquisitions in if the company s cash flows from operations and borrowings are not sufficient to satisfy its capital and exploration expenditure requirements  there is no assurance that additional equity or debt financing will be available to meet such requirements 
capital and exploration expenditures the company requires capital primarily for the acquisition  development and exploitation of  and the exploration for  oil and gas properties  the repayment of indebtedness and general working capital needs 
during  subject to market conditions and drilling and operating results  the company expects to spend approximately million on acquisition  development  exploitation and exploration activities 
the wiser oil company other matters environmental and other regulatory matters the company s business is subject to certain federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the development  exploitation  production and gathering of  and the exploration for  oil and gas  including those relating to the protection of the environment 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
although significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to the company  compliance has not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of the company 
new accounting standards the company adopted the following pronouncements in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be effective  changes in fair value are either offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in earnings when the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the change in fair value  to the extent the hedge is determined to be ineffective  is recorded currently earnings 
the definition of derivatives has also been expanded to include contracts that require physical delivery of oil and gas if the contract allows for net cash settlement 
the company uses derivatives to hedge oil and gas price risk and gains or losses on such derivatives prior to the adoption of sfas no 
were recorded as adjustments to oil and gas sales 
when the company adopted sfas no 
 its existing oil and gas hedging contracts were designated as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedge must be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion  if any  of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedge must be recognized currently in earnings 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

the wiser oil company disclosure regarding forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report  including without limitation statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under business and properties regarding proved reserves  estimated future net revenues  present values  planned capital expenditures including the amount and nature thereof  increases in oil and gas production  the number of wells anticipated to be drilled and the company s financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the company will be realized or  even if substantially realized  that they will have the expected consequences to or effects on its business or operations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are the volatility of oil and gas prices  the ability to acquire or find and successfully develop additional oil and gas reserves  the uncertainty of estimates of reserves and future net revenues  risks relating to acquisitions of producing properties  drilling and operating risks  general economic conditions  competition  domestic and foreign government regulations and other factors which are beyond the company s control 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors 
the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company only uses derivative financial instruments such as commodity futures agreements to hedge against fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
gains and losses on these derivative instruments are recorded as adjustments to oil and gas sales 
the board of directors of the company have adopted a policy governing the use of derivative instruments which requires that all derivatives used by the company relate to an anticipated transaction and prohibits the use of speculative or leveraged derivatives 
interest rate risk total debt at december  included million of fixed rate debt and million of floating rate debt attributed to borrowings under the revolver 
as a result  the company s annual interest cost will fluctuate based on changes in short term interest rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a change in the short term interest rate approximately basis points would be less than million 
at december   the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt of million was million 
the fixed rate debt will mature in may and the floating rate debt will mature in may commodity price risk the company has in the past entered into and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements with respect to portions of its oil  natural gas and ngl production to reduce its sensitivity to volatile commodity prices 
the company believes that hedging  although not free of risk  allows the company to achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce exposure to price fluctuations 
however  hedging arrangements limit the benefit to the company of increases in the prices of the hedged commodity 
moreover  the company s hedging arrangements apply only to a portion of its production and provide only partial price protection against declines in prices 
such arrangements may expose the company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
the company expects that the amount of production it hedges will vary from time to time 
during   and  the company entered into various natural gas and crude oil forward sale agreements  natural gas price swaps and oil price collar agreements to hedge against price fluctuations 
oil and gas sales are adjusted for the effects of hedging transactions as the underlying hedged production is sold 
adjustments to oil and gas sales from the company s hedging activities resulted in an increase in revenues of million in and a reduction of million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  the company recognized a loss on derivatives of in based on december  nymex futures prices  the fair value of the company s hedging arrangements at december  was a the wiser oil company net gain of million 
a increase in both the oil price and the gas price would decrease this gain by million to a loss of million and a decrease in both the oil price and the gas price would increase this gain by million 
as of march  the company s hedging arrangements were as follows excluding hedges with enron see note to the consolidated financial statements crude oil daily volume price per bbl january  to december  a  bbls april  to june  b  bbls july  to september  b  bbls april  to june   bbls floor  ceiling january  to december  c bbls differential swap natural gas daily volume price per mmbtu january  to march  b  mmbtu january  to june  a  mmbtu january  to june  a  mmbtu july  to september  b  mmbtu july  to september  a  mmbtu january  to march  d  mmbtu floor  ceiling january  to march  e  mmbtu floor  ceiling april  to june   mmbtu floor  ceiling october  to december   mmbtu floor  ceiling january  to december   mmbtu floor  ceiling these are collar hedges whereby the company will receive the actual market price if the actual market price is between the floor price and the ceiling price 
if the actual market price is below or above the floor or ceiling prices  the price received by the company will be limited to the floor price or ceiling price  respectively 
a this swap is extendable to december  at the same daily volume and price per mcf or bbl at the option of the counterparty 
as such  it does not qualify for hedge accounting and changes in fair value will be recorded in earnings 
b this swap is extendable for three additional months at the same daily volume and price per mcf or bbl at the option of the counterparty
