commercial real estate lending will continue to be an important line of business with this product line focused on borrowers within florida 
we will strongly emphasize development of our commercial lending products to small and medium sized businesses and high net worth individuals and origination of consumer lending products  primarily home equity loans 
lending to borrowers outside florida has been discontinued 
we also discontinued mortgage warehouse lending and reduced our portfolio balance to  which was comprised of loan collateral in various stages of liquidation 
origination of subprime first lien loans and second lien high ltv loans was eliminated and these portfolios are substantially reduced from prior years

in addition  loans in excess of million require the approval of the board of directors loan committee or a majority of the full board prior to funding 
loan purchases  when applicable  are made subject to the same underwriting standards as loan originations 
to achieve consistency in underwriting policies and procedures  we have centralized the supervision of our loan approval process and all credit decision functions 
our real estate lending consists of extensions of credit secured by real estate mortgages and loans made for the purpose of financing the construction of a building or other improvements to real estate 
using applicable regulatory guidelines as our basis  we have adopted comprehensive  written real estate lending policies that we believe are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
these lending policies reflect consideration of the interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies the guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies in december  which set forth applicable standards for real estate lending 
our lending policy addresses certain lending considerations set forth in the guidelines  including loan to value ltv limits  loan administration procedures  underwriting standards  portfolio diversification standards and documentation  approval and reporting requirements 
the ltv ratio framework  with a ltv ratio being the total amount of credit to be extended divided by the appraised value or purchase price of the property at the time the credit is originated  has been established for each category of real estate loans 
our policy  subject to certain approval exceptions  establishes  among other things  the following maximum ltv limits raw land  land development  construction commercial  multifamily and non residential and improved property  depending on collateral type 
loans on one to four family residential owner occupied mortgages where the ltv exceeds are not made  and any ltv ratio in excess of generally requires appropriate insurance or additional security from readily marketable collateral 
the board of directors reviews and approves our lending policies at least annually 
our commercial business lending is based on a strategy of extending credit to the florida business community  with commercial loans being made to small and medium sized businesses and high net worth individuals with satisfactory cash flows 
we manage our loan portfolio on an ongoing basis using written portfolio management strategies  guidelines for underwriting standards and risk assessment  and procedures for ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration 
we undertake regular portfolio reviews to estimate loss exposure and determine compliance with policies 
see item business asset quality 
asset quality allowance provision for loan losses loan loss allowance activity during included million of loan charge offs net of recoveries   reallocated from the allowance to loan discounts and a million provision for loan losses 
activity during included a million provision for loan losses  loan charge offs net of recoveries of million and  reallocated from the allowance to loan discounts 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on our historical data and the current status of the loan portfolio 
however  there may be additional risks of losses in the future  which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because those risks include general economic trends  as well as available information about conditions affecting individual borrowers  our estimate of the allowance needed is necessarily an approximation 
the allowance is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peers identified by the regulatory agencies 
we conduct an ongoing evaluation and grading of the loan portfolio according to an eight point rating system 
the loan ratings serve as a guideline in assessing the risk level of a particular loan and provide a basis for the estimation of the overall allowance necessary based on historical experience 
the bank s loan review department independently rates loans and  on a quarterly basis  meets with senior management and the loan officers to discuss all loans that have been identified as potential credit quality problems 
the loan review department reports its findings to the directors audit committee to ensure independence of the loan grading function 
we believe that our loan loss allowance policy is consistent with policies established by federal and state regulatory agencies and that the level of our allowance is appropriate in light of our historical loss experience 
provisions for loan losses charged to expense during each period are made based on our estimation of the adequacy of the allowance when compared to the inherent risk of the existing portfolio

nonperforming loans that are restructured and are current as to their revised terms remain in nonperforming status until there is sufficient payment history to warrant upgrade to performing status 
as a matter of policy  interest is not accrued on loans past due days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in process of collection 
if there is sufficient doubt as to the collection of future interest a loan may also be placed in non accrual status before becoming days or more past due 
when a loan is placed in non accrual status  interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current income 
interest income on non accrual loans is recognized only when received 
loans classified as nonaccrual totaled million at december   compared with million at december   a decrease of million 
at december  and  we had nonperforming assets including loans classified as non accrual of million or of total assets and million or of total assets  respectively

investment activities the investment portfolio serves a primary role in our balance sheet management 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment and liquidity requirements 
florida statutes require that a specified minimum amount of liquid assets be maintained based primarily on the level of deposits 
at december  and throughout the year  the amount of liquid assets maintained exceeded the regulatory minimum 
employees at december   we had full time equivalent employees  none of whom were represented by a union or other collective bargaining agreement 
market area as of december   we operated full service branches in counties throughout florida  a highly competitive state for financial services of all kinds 
competition for deposits also exists from money market funds and credit unions 
consumers can choose from a wide range of suppliers of personal credit  including credit card companies  consumer finance companies  credit unions and mortgage bankers  as well as from competing financial institutions and through alternative delivery channels such as the internet

one of our primary objectives is to reduce fluctuations in net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
to manage interest rate risk  the board of directors has established interest rate risk policies and procedures  which delegate to the bank s asset liability committee the responsibility to monitor and report on interest rate risk  devise strategies to manage interest rate risk  monitor loan originations and deposit activity  and approve pricing strategies

supervision and regulation we are extensively regulated under both federal and state law 
the following is a brief summary of certain statutes  rules  and regulations affecting us 
this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions referenced below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to our business 
supervision  regulation  and examination by the bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than stockholders 
regulation of the company we are a bank holding company registered with the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhc act 
we are subject to the applicable provisions of the bhc act and the supervision  examination  and regulations of the federal reserve 
the bhc act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if  after such acquisition  the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than five percent of the voting shares of the bank  it or any of its subsidiaries  other than a bank  may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of the bank  or it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company 
similar federal statues require bank holding companies and other companies to obtain the prior approval of the office of thrift and supervision ots before acquiring ownership or control of a savings association 
the bhc act further provides that the federal reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the united states  or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country  or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade  unless the anti competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community served 
the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served 
considerations of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy  and consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties performance under the community reinvestment act of the cra 
the bhc act  as amended by the interstate banking provisions of the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking act  authorizes any bank holding company located in florida to acquire a bank located in any other state  and any bank holding company located outside florida may lawfully acquire any florida based bank  regardless of state law to the contrary  in either case subject to certain deposit percentage  aging requirements  and other restrictions 
the interstate banking act also generally provides that national and state chartered banks may branch interstate through acquisitions of banks in other states  unless a state has opted out of the interstate branching provisions of the interstate banking act prior to june  neither florida nor any other state in the southeastern united states has opted out 
accordingly  we would have the ability to acquire a bank in a state in the southeast and consolidate the newly acquired bank and the bank into a single bank with interstate branches 
the bhc act  as currently in effect  generally prohibits us from engaging in activities other than banking or managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries and from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect control of any company engaged in any activities other than those activities determined by the federal reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
in determining whether a particular activity is permissible  the federal reserve must consider whether the performance of such an activity reasonably can be expected to produce benefits to the public  such as greater convenience  increased competition  or gains in efficiency  that outweigh possible adverse effects  such as undue concentration of resources  decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest  or unsound banking practices 
the federal reserve has determined that  as a general matter  bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries may engage in  among other things  operating a thrift subsidiary  conducting discount securities brokerage activities  performing certain data processing services and acting as agent or broker in selling certain types of insurance in connection with credit transactions 
the bhc act does not place territorial limitations on permissible non banking activities of bank holding companies 
despite prior approval  the federal reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its non bank subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness  or stability of any bank subsidiary of the holding company 
under federal reserve policy  bank holding companies are expected to act as a source of financial strength and support to their subsidiary banks 
this support may be required at times when  absent such federal reserve policy  the holding company may not be inclined to provide it 
in addition  any capital loans by a bank holding company to any bank subsidiary are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy  any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority payment 
the gramm leach bliley act the act amends the bhc act to authorize new financial holding companies fhc 
under the fhc provisions of the act  a bhc can qualify to become a fhc if all of its bank and thrift subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed and have a cra rating of satisfactory or better 
once a bhc becomes a fhc  it is permitted to conduct any securities  insurance and merchant banking activities  as well as any other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity  such as developing financial software  hosting internet web sites relating to financial matters and operating a travel agency 
under the regulatory structure prescribed by the act  the federal reserve acts as the umbrella regulator for the fhc  with each fhc subsidiary subject to supervision and regulation by its own functional regulator or agency 
the act also gives banks the option of conducting certain newly permitted financial activities in a subsidiary rather than using a fhc 
banks that satisfy the well capitalized  well managed and cra requirements applicable to fhcs will be able to establish financial subsidiaries that are permitted to conduct all financial activities as agency and some financial activities as principal such as securities underwriting 
the main activities in which financial subsidiaries currently are prohibited from engaging are insurance underwriting  real estate development and merchant banking 
regulation of the bank the bank is organized as a florida chartered commercial bank and is regulated and supervised by the department 
the fdic serves as its primary federal regulator and the administrator of the fund that insures the bank s deposits 
the department and the fdic conduct regular examinations  reviewing the adequacy of the loan loss reserves  quality of loans and investments  propriety of management practices  compliance with laws and regulations  and other aspects of operations 
in addition to these regular examinations  the bank must file quarterly reports containing detailed financial statements and schedules 
federal and florida banking laws and regulations govern all areas of the operations of the bank  including reserves  loans  mortgages  capital  issuances of securities  payment of dividends  and establishment of branches 
as its primary regulators  the department and the fdic have authority to impose penalties  initiate civil and administrative actions  and take other steps intended to prevent the bank from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices 
the bank is a member of the bank insurance fund bif and  as such  deposits in the bank are insured by the fdic to the maximum extent permissible by law 
the bank is subject to the provisions of the cra 
under the cra  the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with their safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities  including low and moderate income individuals and neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit the bank s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to their particular communities  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in the case of the bank  the fdic in connection with their regular examinations  to assess a financial institution s record in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by it  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the evaluation focuses on three tests a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its service areas  an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  and a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches and other offices 
a federal banking agency s assessment of a financial institution s cra record is made available to the public 
further  such assessment is required whenever the institution applies to  among other things  establish a new branch that will accept deposits  relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with  or acquire the assets of or assume the liabilities of  a federally regulated financial institution 
in the case where the company applies for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  the federal regulator approving the transaction will also assess the cra records of the bank 
the bank received a satisfactory cra rating in its most recent examination 
transactions with affiliates there are multiple restrictions on the extent to which the company and any future non bank subsidiaries can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from the bank 
there are also restrictions on the bank s purchase of  or investment in  the securities or other assets of the company 
in the event such transactions are permissible  they must be on the same terms and circumstances  including credit standards  that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non affiliated companies 
no such transactions existed at december  deposit insurance the bank is subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
the bank is subject to a risk based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities 
this system assigns an institution to one of three capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized 
an institution is also assigned  by the fdic  to one of three supervisory subgroups within each capital group 
the supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation provided to the fdic by the institution s primary federal regulator and information which the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance funds which may include  if applicable  information provided by the institution s state supervisor 
an institution s insurance assessment rate is then determined based on the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned  and attributed to the deposit insurance funds 
under the risk based assessment system  there are nine assessment risk classifications ie  combinations of capital groups and supervisory subgroups to which different assessment rates are applied 
assessment rates on deposits for an institution in the highest category ie  well capitalized and healthy are less than assessment rates on deposits for an institution in the lowest category ie  undercapitalized and substantial supervisory concern 
the bank  as a state chartered commercial bank  is a member of bif 
however as part of the acquisitions the bank has undertaken in the past  the bank acquired deposits previously insured by the savings association insurance fund the saif 
based on these acquisitions  the bank is required to pay insurance premiums to the fdic on a substantial portion of its deposits at the saif assessment rate notwithstanding its status as a bif member 
as of september   the most recent measurement date for assessment purposes  approximately of the bank s deposits was treated as saif insured deposits  with the remaining of deposits being assessed at the bif rate 
prior to enactment of the deposit insurance funds act of the funds act  only assessments against saif member institutions were available to pay interest on the so called fico bonds  which were issued by the financing corporation the fico in the late s to fund the resolution of troubled thrifts 
the funds act shifted a portion of the fico funding obligations to the bif member institutions beginning in through the end of  the fico assessment rate on bif assessable deposits was required by the statute to be one fifth of the saif rate 
beginning january   the fdic equalized the fico assessment rates for members of both insurance funds at percent 
in  the bank s total fico payment obligation was   of which was attributable to the bank s saif assessable deposits and the balance of which was attributable to its bif assessable deposits 
capital requirements we are required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve for the company  and the fdic for the bank 
the minimum capital requirements applicable to the company and the bank are essentially the same 
failure to meet capital guidelines could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies  including issuance of a capital directive  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  a prohibition on the taking of brokered deposits  and certain other restrictions on our business  including growth and dividend restrictions 
substantial additional restrictions can be imposed upon us if we fail to meet applicable capital requirements under the federal prompt corrective action regulations 
as of december   the bank s capital ratios were considered well capitalized for purposes of the agencies guidelines 
for additional information regarding capital requirements applicable to the company and the bank and their compliance with such requirements see note regulatory capital requirements 
payment of dividends under federal law  if  in the opinion of the fdic  the bank is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  the fdic may require  after notice and hearing  that the bank cease and desist from such practice 
the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies in december  the bank may not pay any dividend to the company if such payment would cause it to become undercapitalized 
at december   the bank s regulatory capital ratios exceeded the minimum requirements for a well capitalized bank 
as a florida chartered commercial bank  the bank is subject to the laws of florida as to the payment of dividends 
under the florida financial institutions code  the prior approval of the department is required if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year will exceed the sum of a bank s net retained profits net income less any dividends paid for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two years 
as of january   the bank had a net retained profit deficit for dividend payment purposes of million and is restricted from making dividend payments to the parent company until that deficit is cured 
at december   the company had unrestricted cash available for debt service payments of million 
the company s annual debt service payments total million 
federal reserve system the federal reserve system is used primarily for the settlement of funds between member banks 
the federal reserve regulations require banks to maintain noninterest earning reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and regular checking accounts 
the federal reserve board regulations  effective november   generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows for accounts aggregating million or less the reserve requirement is  and for accounts greater than million  the reserve requirement is against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances subject to adjustments by the federal reserve are exempted from the reserve requirements 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the department 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a noninterest bearing account at a federal reserve bank or a pass through account as defined by the federal reserve  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the bank s interest earning assets 
fhlb system members  including the bank  also are authorized to borrow from the federal reserve discount window  but federal reserve regulations require institutions to exhaust all fhlb sources before borrowing from a federal reserve bank 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system 
the fhlb system  which consists of regional federal home loan banks is governed and regulated by the federal housing finance board the fhfb 
the fhlb provides a central credit facility for member institutions 
as a member of the fhlb  we are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb in an amount at least equal to the greater of one percent of the aggregate principal amount of our unpaid residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts and similar obligations as of the close of each calendar year  or five percent of our borrowings from the fhlb including advances and letters of credit issued by the fhlb on our behalf 
the fhlb makes advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures periodically established by the fhfb and the board of directors of the fhlb 
currently  outstanding advances from the fhlb are required to be secured by a member s shares of stock in the fhlb and by certain types of mortgages and other assets 
interest rates charged for advances vary depending on maturity  the cost of funds to the fhlb and the purpose of the borrowing 
as of december   we had million of outstanding advances from the fhlb with an unused credit line totaling million 
liquidity under florida banking regulations  we are required to maintain a daily liquidity position equal to at least of our total transaction accounts and eight percent of our total non transaction accounts  less those deposits of public funds for which security has been pledged as provided by law 
we may satisfy our liquidity requirements with cash on hand including cash items in process of collection  deposits held with the federal reserve  demand deposits due from correspondent banks  federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits maturing in days or less and the market value of certain unencumbered  rated  investment grade securities and securities issued by florida or any county  municipality of other political subdivision within the state 
the department and fdic review our liquidity position as part of their examinations 
if we fail to comply with the liquidity requirements  we generally may not further diminish liquidity either by making any new loans other than by discounting or purchasing bills of exchange payable at sight or by paying dividends 
at december   using applicable florida regulations  the bank s liquidity position was million compared to a minimum position of million 
monetary policy and economic controls the banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary policies of the federal reserve 
changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing  availability of borrowing at the discount window  open market operations  the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits and the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve 
the monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve are influenced by various factors  including inflation  unemployment  short and long term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the united states government 
future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the bank cannot be predicted 
effects of inflation as a financial institution  the majority of our assets are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from those of more industrial or commercial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets 
the effects of inflation on the financial condition and results of operations  therefore  are less significant than the effects of changes in interest rates 
the most significant effect of inflation is on noninterest expense  which tends to rise during periods of general inflation 
changes in accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb regularly issues proposals and guidelines on the accounting practices of commercial enterprises in general and financial institutions in particular 
for additional information on the effect of any such issues on our financial condition and results of operation  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item properties currently  the bank operates full service branch banking offices located in florida counties  of which are leased and are owned 
our branches have square footage ranging from  square feet to  square feet with lease terms ranging from the year to the year our executive offices are located at second avenue ne  suite  st 
petersburg  florida   where we leased approximately  square feet of space under a lease that expires in the year our operations and servicing functions are conducted from a  square foot owned building located at th street n  st 
petersburg  fl we have various options to renew leases at most of our branch locations 
we also have seven facilities that are not used for banking purposes  one of which is owned and six of which are leased 
for further information regarding our lease obligations  see the notes to consolidated financial statements

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our balance sheets and statements of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial and other information  the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere therein 
years ended december  and comparison of balance sheets at december  and overview our total assets were billion at december   and billion at december   an increase of million or 
during  the company undertook a strategy to sell those branch offices in areas outside its desired market area  which reduced asset growth 
excluding those branch sales transactions  total assets would have increased by million 
securities during  loan repayments  primarily from discontinued loan products  were substantial and the additional liquidity from loan runoff was invested in mortgage securities 
at december   securities were million  compared to million at december   an increase of million or 
at december   million of securities were classified as available for sale  million were classified as held to maturity and million were trading assets  all of which were mortgage related securities 
included in the trading asset category were several investments acquired in prior years  including a million subordinate tranche purchased from a securitization of high ltv loans in june which has since been sold see item business subsequent events  million in overcollateralization and residual interests in cash flows from a million securitization in december and a million securitization of high ltv loans in june  and million representing excess spread on mortgage servicing rights 
the market values assigned to the mbs classified as available for sale were derived using market quotations at december  trading assets are evaluated at least quarterly with any valuation adjustment reflected as a trading gain or loss in the statement of operations 
under applicable accounting rules  use of quoted market values is the preferred method for valuing trading assets 
however  where the market for those assets is illiquid and price quotations are not readily available  other methods are permitted  including techniques utilizing the present value of expected cash flows 
we have used present value techniques to value our trading assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we obtained current credit data on the loans underlying the trading assets related to high ltv loan securitizations 
based on that analysis  which indicated some deterioration in the quality of the loans underlying the residual interest when compared to similar prior analysis  and on the historical loss history of those loans  an adjustment was made to the expected cumulative losses on each securitization expressed as total lifetime losses as a percent of the original balance of loans in the securitization 
the cumulative loss factor for the securitization completed in december was increased from an original estimate of to a current estimate of 
the cumulative loss factor for the securitization completed in june was increased from an original estimate of to a current estimate of 
as a result of that increase in expected future losses  a trading loss of million was recorded for we believe these valuations are a reasonable approximation of the fair market value of the mortgage related securities classified as trading assets  however  there is no assurance that we could realize these values if these assets were sold in the current illiquid market for high ltv related assets 
loans total loans were billion at december   compared to billion at december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was due to payoffs of discontinued loan products and to the overall rapid decline in interest rates  which caused loan prepayments to rise 
this decline in the loan portfolio included million from payoffs of out of state loans  a decrease of million from loans that were sold in the branch sales  a million decrease in warehouse lines of credit  an million decline from securitizing residential loans into mortgage securities  and a million net decrease in loans within the state of florida 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses amounted to million of portfolio loans at december   compared with million of portfolio loans at december  at december   the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was compared to at the end of during we recorded a million provision for loan losses 
other activity included million of loan charge offs net of recoveries and  reallocated from the allowance to loan discount 
net chargeoffs for the year included losses of million on high ltv loans and million from warehouse lines of credit deemed uncollectible  which included a million charge on a warehouse line to a now defunct warehouse lender 
we also charged off  of residential loans and million of home equity loans  both comprised primarily of loans originated in the timeframe 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets amounted to million or of total assets at december   compared with million or of total assets at december  nonperforming loans totaled million or of total loans at december   a decrease of million from december  nonperforming one to four family residential mortgage loans decreased by million  while nonperforming warehouse lines of credit and home equity loans decreased million 
ore increased million from million at december   to million at december  our nonperforming assets at year end included a hotel in wilmington  delaware and a residential development in naples  florida  which we took ownership of in  that accounted for million or of our total nonperforming assets 
residential loans in various stages of foreclosure account for an additional of our total nonperforming assets 
deposits total deposits were billion at december   compared to billion at december   a decrease of million or 
the decline in deposits was largely due to the branch sales completed in excluding those branch sales  total deposits would have increased by million 
management s business plan includes  as one of the principal strategies  a reduction in the dependence on time deposits as a source of funds 
to this end  the mix of total deposits during improved with time deposits reduced to of total deposits at year end  compared with at the end of transaction accounts  including checking and money market accounts  were of total deposits and savings deposits were of the total at year end compared to and  respectively  at the end of overall  since year end  certificates of deposit declined million  of which million resulted from the branch sales 
checking accounts including non retail deposits such as official checks increased million  while savings deposits decreased by million 
stockholders equity stockholders equity was million at december   or of total assets  compared to million or of total assets at december  at december   the bank s tier leverage capital ratio was  its tier risk based capital ratio was  and its total risk based capital ratio was  all in excess of fdic guidelines for an institution to be considered a well capitalized bank 
the same ratios for the company were  and 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  and overview during  the company recorded a million writedown to its interest only residual investments and a million chargeoff of a warehouse line of credit to greatstone  a defunct mortgage lender 
both items were major factors leading to a million or per share net loss for the full year of on a cash basis  the net loss was million or per share 
excluding special items from cash results which include the above two charges and million in gains on sale of branches  the company would have recorded cash basis net income for of million or per share 
analysis of net interest income see table on page net interest margin  the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of funds  including noninterest bearing sources  was for compared to for on a quarterly basis throughout  net interest margin fell to a yearly low of in the third quarter of and then recovered to in the fourth quarter 
the changes in net interest margin throughout reflect the overall rapid decline in market interest rates that has taken place during the year 
the repricing structure of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is asset sensitive  meaning that asset yield declines faster than funds costs during the first three to four months following a rate reduction 
after that three to four month period passes  declining funds costs catch up with and then overtake the decline in asset yield 
the series of consecutive rate cuts during lengthened the time needed to stabilize the net interest margin 
during the fourth quarter of that stabilization took place with funds costs declining by basis points while asset yield declined by a lesser amount  basis points 
also contributing to the decline in net interest margin during the first three quarters of was a change in asset mix with a higher percentage of earning assets invested in mortgage securities and a reduced amount of loans outstanding 
the company s plan to improve the quality of the loan portfolio  which included the sale of high ltv loans  exit from the mortgage warehouse lending line of business and payoffs of out of state loans  all were major contributors to a decline in average loans outstanding

the asset liability management committee alco reviews our liquidity  which is our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet the funding needs of current loan demand  deposit withdrawals and other cash demands 
the primary sources of funds consist of deposits  amortization and prepayments of loans  sales and maturities of investments  other funds from operations and our capital 
we are a member of the fhlb and have the ability to borrow to supplement our liquidity needs with our borrowing capacity equal to of our total assets 
the bank also maintains borrowing lines of credit using its investment portfolio as collateral 
those fhlb borrowings  known as advances  are secured by the bank s mortgage loan portfolio  and the terms and rates charged for fhlb advances vary based on an institution s loan portfolio and in response to general economic conditions 
a variety of borrowing plans is offered by the fhlb  each with its own maturity and interest rate 
the fhlb will consider various factors  including an institution s regulatory capital position  net income  quality and composition of assets  lending policies and practices  and level of current borrowings from all sources  in determining the amount of credit to extend to an institution 
as of december   the bank had million of outstanding advances from the fhlb

asset liability management the management of interest rate risk is one of the most significant factors affecting the ability to achieve future earnings 
one traditional measure of the mismatch of assets maturing or re pricing within certain periods  and liabilities maturing or re pricing within the same period  is the gap for such period 
controlling the maturity or re pricing of an institution s assets and liabilities in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
negative gap occurs when  during a specific time period  more of an institution s liabilities are scheduled to re price than its assets  so that  barring other factors affecting interest income and expense  in periods of rising interest rates the institution s interest expense would increase more rapidly than its interest income  and in periods of falling interest rates the institution s interest expense would decrease more rapidly than its interest income 
positive gap occurs when more of an institution s assets are scheduled to re price than its liabilities  so that  barring other factors affecting interest income and expense  in periods of falling interest rates the institution s interest income would decrease more rapidly than its interest expense  and in periods of rising interest rates the institution s interest income would increase more rapidly than its interest expense 
in addition to the traditional gap measurement  management also relied on the measurement of the duration of cash flows for the various assets and liabilities 
duration is the weighted average of the terms of future cash flows  where the present values of the cash flows are the weights 
this is the effective term of a series of cash flows  comparable to the term of a zero coupon single cash flow instrument 
the effective term is a measure of the price sensitivity of an instrument the price of a longer term instrument is more sensitive than that of a shorter term instrument 
at december   the duration of the company s assets was years while the duration of its liabilities was years 
we strive to maintain a cumulative one year gap of no more than plus or minus of total assets and to limit the change in net interest income over a one year time horizon to no more than of base net interest income  assuming an immediate and sustained basis point change in market interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk primarily by changing the maturity distribution of our investment portfolio and emphasizing loan originations carrying variable interest rates tied to interest sensitive indices 
additionally  the bank may utilize long term fixed rate advances from the fhlb to improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
currently  off balance sheet hedging instruments are not used to manage overall interest rate risk 
we may expand our use of off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage exposure to overall interest rate risk in the future  subject to board approval 
the cumulative one year gap at december   was a negative million  or a negative expressed as a percentage of total assets 
our net interest income sensitivity  assuming an immediate and sustained change in market interest rates of plus or minus basis points  was a negative change for minus basis points and a negative change for plus basis points 
the following table presents the maturities or re pricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the balances shown have been derived based on the financial characteristics of the various assets and liabilities 
adjustable and floating rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than their scheduled maturity dates 
fixed rate loans are shown in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid according to contractual amortization and  where appropriate  prepayment assumptions  based on the coupon rates in the portfolio have been used to adjust the repayment amounts 
re pricing of time deposits is based on their scheduled maturities 
based on an analysis of our deposit accounts and our experience in the markets in which we operate  we have incorporated the following core deposit assumptions in the repricing table percent repricing in months months years interest checking money market savings using those core deposits assumptions as well as current market indications for the level of asset prepayment activity  the interest rate sensitivity our balance sheet would be as follows in thousands months months years over years yield yield yield yield amount rate amount rate amount rate amount rate interest earning assets securities federal funds sold interest bearing deposits in banks fhlb stock portfolio loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits interest checking money market savings time deposits fhlb advances outside borrowings holding company debt total interest bearing liabilities excess deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities period total cumulative cumulative as a percent of total assets
