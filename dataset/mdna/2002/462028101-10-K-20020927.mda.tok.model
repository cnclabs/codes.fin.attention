item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results of operations could differ significantly from those anticipated in such forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors discussed under item business and elsewhere in this report 
overview the company is a leader in the development  manufacture and sale of active drug transport systems used to treat local inflammation in the sports and occupational medicine and physical therapy markets 
the company s current product line is based on proprietary iontophoretic drug delivery technology 
the majority of the company s revenues have been generated through the sale of the phoresor system and related products that employ its proprietary technology 
the company is seeking opportunities to market or develop new products designed to improve the quality and efficiency of medical care it its served markets 
in addition  the company is seeking collaborative opportunities to develop its non invasive drug transport technology to satisfy substantial unmet medical needs 
the company has proprietary technologies in various stages of research and product development for the treatment of acute local inflammation and for the treatment of ophthalmic disease 
since its inception  the company has generally incurred operating losses as a result of costs associated with internally funded research and development activities 
as of june   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
the company s ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend on its ability to achieve market acceptance and successfully expand sales of its existing products and successfully complete the development of  receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully manufacture and market its products under development  as to which there can be no assurance 
fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
the company achieved record annual product sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increased product sales in the last three fiscal quarters of  including record sales in the fourth quarter  helped offset the negative impact on sales orders in the first quarter resulting from a market shortage of an anti inflammatory drug often used with its iontophoretic drug delivery products 
the company believes that the long term effects of this drug shortage have since been mitigated and its sales orders have returned to normal levels following the drug shortage 
contract research revenues  royalties and license fees were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in contract research revenue reflects the recognition of a  one time payment for work performed under a collaborative research agreement with santen pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
the company and santen have concluded work under their collaborative development agreement 
the amount of future revenue levels will be dependent upon the company s ability to expand its existing relationships and establish new collaborative research and product development programs 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margins on product sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal  reflecting higher fixed costs  including depreciation expense  associated with the company s new manufacturing and research facility 
research and development expense 
research and development expenditures decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s research and development expenditures in the current periods reflect its investment in its ophthalmic and other product development programs 
the decrease in fiscal was a result of cost reduction measures  including the suspension or curtailment of certain product development programs 
during fiscal  the company intends to concentrate research and development efforts on its commercial business for the development of treatments for acute local inflammation in the sports and occupational medicine and physical therapy markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in this decrease relates primarily to the suspension of the company s local inflammation development program  which resulted in a decrease of certain pre market research and other costs associated with the program 
non recurring charges 
consistent with current accounting standards and according to its policy  the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
following the suspension of certain research and development activities  a change in strategic focus  and the implementation of a new patent management strategy  the company performed a review for impairment of its intangible assets 
based on the review  the company recorded a non cash charge of  for the impairment of long lived assets for the period ended june  the impairment charge represents the write off of unamortized acquisition costs of certain patents and other intellectual property rights related to certain product development programs that have either been suspended or curtailed 
the company accrued for and recorded restructuring charges of  and  in fiscal and for certain involuntary employee termination benefits related to the suspension or curtailment of certain product development programs 
during fiscal and  and employees  respectively  were terminated and received involuntary termination benefits 
of the total employees terminated  were engaged in research and product development activities  and in sales and general administration 
as of june   substantially all of these termination benefits had been paid 
other costs and expenses 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase is attributed to higher interest expense resulting from the increased equipment and furniture purchased under the company s lease line and the term loan related to the building consolidation and relocation 
interest income and other miscellaneous income was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal amounts in both periods reflect interest earnings on invested cash balances 
the decrease is due to lower interest rates on a lower invested cash balance 
income taxes 
the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards  which  under the current change of ownership rules of the internal revenue code of  as amended  may be subject to substantial annual limitation 
no income tax benefit was recognized for fiscal or net loss 
a net loss of  in fiscal compares to a net loss of  in fiscal the improved net loss position in fiscal was a result of significant cost control measures  including the suspension or curtailment of certain development programs  taken by the company 
the net loss in fiscal includes non recurring charges of  the majority of the fiscal net loss can be attributed to internally funded research and development programs  including approximately million for phase iii clinical studies and other expenses associated with the local inflammation program 
fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal growth in the company s iogel line of iontophoretic patches and increased market acceptance of iontophoresis contributed to the increase in product sales 
contract research revenues  royalties and license fees were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal costs of products sold 
costs of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margins on product sales improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal during the second half of fiscal the company experienced downward pressure on its product margins due to higher fixed costs resulting from its relocation to a new facility and from costs associated with the installation of automated manufacturing equipment 
research and development expense 
research and development expenditures increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which reflected the company s investment in key internal research and product development programs 
during fiscal and  the company invested million and million  respectively  in product development and phase iii clinical studies related to its local inflammation program 
in addition  during fiscal  the company invested further into the pre clinical development of its proprietary ophthalmic pharmaceutical systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in this increase relates primarily to pre marketing activity associated with the company s acute local inflammation program  as well as increased patent prosecution and maintenance costs 
non recurring charge 
the company incurred a non recurring charge in fiscal of  associated with the planned consolidation of its research  administrative and manufacturing operations 
other costs and expenses 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase can be attributed to higher interest expense associated with higher long term obligations 
interest income and other miscellaneous income was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal amounts in both periods reflect interest earnings on the invested cash balances 
net loss 
a net loss of  in fiscal compares to a net loss of  in fiscal the majority of the net loss in fiscal and can be attributed to internally funded research and development programs  including phase iii clinical studies associated with the local inflammation program 
approximately million of fiscal operating expenses were attributed to the local inflammation program compared to approximately million in fiscal during both periods  net interest earnings on invested cash balances offset a loss from operations  in part 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal   and  the company s operating losses  which resulted primarily from investment in research and development programs  were funded largely by cash flow from its commercial operating business and its cash reserves from its initial public offering in april as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million 
additionally  the company had approximately million of long term restricted cash  invested in mutual funds and used to secure long term financing 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in a manner which is intended to maximize liquidity and return while minimizing investment risk  and  whenever possible  the company seeks to minimize the potential effects of concentration of credit risk 
the company consumed   and  in cash from operating activities during fiscal   and  respectively 
the company s efforts to stabilize its cost structure resulted in an improved net loss position and a decrease in cash consumption for operating activities in fiscal the increased consumption of cash for operating activities in fiscal can be attributed to the company s investment in research and product development and the resulting net operating losses 
historically  the company s operations have not been capital intensive 
however  during fiscal the company invested approximately million for the relocation and consolidation of its research and manufacturing facilities and for new equipment to automate its manufacturing process 
the company used long term financing agreements to fund these investments 
as of june   the company had approximately million outstanding under financing agreements  all of which was recorded as long term obligations  including the current portion 
the company intends to enter into additional financing agreements to fund the majority of its capital equipment needs during the next months  but does not anticipate a significant investment in capital equipment during that time 
the company s equipment and furniture expenditures in excess of equipment acquired under capital lease agreements were   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
other sources and uses of cash during the periods included the following during fiscal  the company used  for payments on long term obligations and its restricted cash requirements decreased  during fiscal  the company used  for payments on long term obligations  received  in proceeds from exercise of stock options  and secured long term financing with  of restricted cash 
during fiscal  the company purchased all rights to the iontophoretic intellectual property owned by laboratories fournier  including patented technology  know how and a year non compete clause  at a cost of million  including transaction expenses  used  for payments on long term capital lease obligations  and received  in proceeds from exercise of stock options 
in an effort to meet anticipated future growth and to consolidate its research and administrative functions and manufacturing operations  the company executed a lease agreement in fiscal for an approximate  square foot facility 
accordingly  the company recorded a non recurring charge of  relating to the abandonment of certain facilities 
the company funded the facilities modification and consolidation with a term loan and available credit under its lease lines 
the company will continue to incur costs associated with its research and product development activities 
during fiscal  these costs will be funded internally from the company s established commercial business  term loan and capital lease financing agreements  and from existing cash balances 
the company anticipates that at its current operating levels  existing cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs through fiscal and beyond 
however  the company may be required to or elect to raise additional capital before that time 
the company s actual capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the following list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment or estimation in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues on product sales are recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arms length transfer has occurred  generally upon shipment  when title has passed  and the price is fixed or determinable 
the company recognizes revenue from contract research based upon performance of its obligations  making qualifying expenditures and delivery of reports and data 
revenues from royalty and license agreements are based on third party sales and are recognized in the quarter in which payment is either received or may be reasonably estimated 
long lived assets the carrying amounts of long lived assets  and the related amortization periods  are reviewed for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable within the estimated useful life 
when the company determines the existence of impairment indicators  the impairment loss is measured based on the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of the impaired assets 
the carrying value of the underlying assets is reduced  with the reduction charged to expense  so that the carrying value is equal to fair value 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventories at least quarterly  taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand  the price the company expects to obtain for its products in their respective markets compared with historical cost  and the remaining shelf life of goods on hand 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the disposal of long lived assets 
sfas is required to be adopted for all fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operation 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operation 
additional risk factors future results could differ materially from those currently anticipated by the company due to a number of factors  including those identified in this section and elsewhere in this form k  any of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
continuing operating losses  uncertainty of future profitability 
since  the company has sustained losses in each fiscal year  except fiscal years and the company had an accumulated deficit of million as of june  the company s ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend on its ability to achieve market acceptance  successfully expand sales of its existing products  and successfully complete the development of  receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully manufacture and market  its products under development 
the success of the company s current products and products under development may also depend on the timing of new product introductions by the company relative to its competitors and other factors 
uncertainties related to product development 
the company may be required to undertake time consuming and costly product development activities  including clinical trials  and seek regulatory approval for new applications and products 
product revenues may not be realized from the sale of any such products for several years  if at all 
the company can give no assurance that its product development efforts  either alone or in collaboration with other parties  will ever be successfully completed  that it can obtain required regulatory approvals of its products  that products under development can be manufactured at acceptable cost or with appropriate quality  or that its products can meet market needs or achieve market acceptance 
before seeking regulatory approval for the commercial sale of its products  the company must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that those products are safe and effective for use in the target indications 
there can be no assurances the company will be able to complete its clinical trials in a timely manner  if at all 
the results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be indicative of results the company will obtain in large scale testing 
there can be no assurance the company s clinical trials will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain requisite regulatory approvals or that those clinical trials will result in additional marketable products 
the use of any product the company develops may produce undesirable side effects that could result in the interruption  delay or suspension of clinical trials  or the failure to obtain fda or other regulatory approval for targeted indications 
if the company s products under development are not shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials  the resulting delays in developing other compounds and conducting related preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as the need for additional financing to complete such testing and trials  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
reliance on collaborative partners 
the company has previously entered into arrangements with corporate partners  licensors  licensees and other parties for the development  clinical testing  manufacture  marketing or commercialization of certain of its products or products in development 
the process of establishing collaborative partners is difficult  time consuming  and involves significant uncertainty 
discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of new collaborative relationships on favorable terms  if at all 
if successful in establishing a collaborative agreement  such agreement may never result in the successful development of products or the generation of significant revenue 
until the company elects to and enters into additional collaborative agreements  it will be required to internally fund all of its research and development expenditures 
such agreements could limit the company s flexibility in pursuing alternatives for the development or commercialization of its products 
to the extent the company chooses not  or is not able  to establish such collaborations  it could experience significantly increased business risk and capital requirements in the development  clinical testing  manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of its products 
the company could also encounter significant delays in introducing products into markets or find that the development  manufacture or sale of proposed products in such markets is adversely affected by the absence of those collaborative arrangements 
intense competition and rapid technological change 
the drug delivery  pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive and rapidly evolving  with significant developments expected to continue at a rapid pace 
many competitors  including public and private corporations  academic institutions  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations  are involved in the development of drug delivery systems  including competing electrotransport related drug delivery technologies 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources  are more experienced  and are larger  more established organizations than the company 
in addition  these competitors may offer broader product lines  have greater name recognition  and offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
accordingly  competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies  and obtaining fda approval or gaining market share for products  more rapidly than the company 
many of these competitors currently have drug delivery products that are approved or in development 
there can be no assurance the company s competitors will not succeed in more rapidly developing or marketing products that are more effective or commercially attractive than the company s current or future products  or that would render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
there can also be no assurance the company will have the financial resources  technical or management expertise  or manufacturing or support capability to compete in the future 
the first pharmaceutical product to reach the market in a therapeutic area or using a certain drug delivery technology generally obtains and maintains a significant market share relative to later entrants to the market 
the company s success will depend on its ability to maintain a competitive position and develop new products and technologies for efficient and cost effective drug delivery 
there can be no assurance any of the company s products will have advantages that will be significant enough to cause medical professionals to prefer or even use them 
new drugs or further development of alternative drug delivery methods may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific drug or indication  or may offer comparable performance at lower cost  than that offered by the company s products 
reliance on third party distribution 
the company presently markets its drug delivery systems for the treatment of acute local inflammation primarily to physical therapists through a nationwide network of distributors and independent sales representatives 
the company is currently marketing its local dermal anesthesia products in the united states hospital market through a limited number of sales personnel who work directly for the company and independent manufacturers representatives 
in order to achieve broad distribution and market penetration of its current and future products  the company intends to expand its marketing presence through direct sales and marketing or through co marketing of its products with collaborative marketing partners or distributors that have national or market specific marketing capabilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain existing  or establish new  marketing arrangements on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
dependence on patents and proprietary technology 
the company s ability to commercialize many of the products it has under development will depend  in part  on its or its licensors ability  both in the united states and in other countries  to obtain patents  enforce those patents  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
the patent positions of drug delivery  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
there can be no assurance the patents currently owned and licensed by the company  or any future patents  will prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products  or that other companies will not be issued patents that may prevent the sale of company products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties by the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance any of the company s products or methods will be patentable  will not infringe upon the patents of third parties  or that the company s patents or future patents will give the company an exclusive position in the subject matter claimed by those patents 
the company may be unable to avoid infringement of third party patents and may have to obtain licenses  defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those patents in court 
there can be no assurance a license will be available to the company  if at all  on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  or that the company will prevail in any patent litigation 
there can be no assurance the company s pending patent applications will result in issued patents  patent protection will be secured for any particular technology  any patents that have been or may be issued to the company or its licensors will be valid or enforceable or that the company s patents will provide meaningful protection to the company 
the company also relies on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information in its product development activities 
the company seeks to protect trade secrets and proprietary knowledge  in part  through confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
to the extent the company relies on confidential information to maintain its competitive position  there can be no assurance other parties may not independently develop the same or similar information 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of the company s confidential information and may not provide the company with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information 
the company s failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position and results of operations 
also  the effect of potential legislative changes on the company s intellectual property is uncertain 
need to manage expanding operations 
if the company is successful in achieving market acceptance of its products and products under development  it will be required to expand its operations  particularly in the areas of research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing 
as the company expands its operations in these areas  those expansions will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain on the company s management  operating and financial systems and other resources 
to accommodate any such growth and compete effectively  the company will be required to implement improved information systems  procedures and controls  and to expand  train  motivate and manage its work force 
the company s future success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of its current and future management personnel to operate effectively both independently and as a group 
there can be no assurance the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s future operations 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding 
the further development and commercialization of the company s products and technology will require a commitment of substantial funds to conduct research and development activities  including preclinical and clinical studies  to expand distribution and hire additional sales and marketing personnel and to expand and develop manufacturing capabilities 
although the company believes that at its current operating levels  existing cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs through fiscal and beyond  it may be required or elect to raise additional capital before that time 
actual capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to  the costs and timing of research and development activities  the number and type of clinical tests required in seeking approval of products from governmental agencies  the success of the development efforts  the costs and timing of sales and marketing expansion  the extent to which existing and new products gain market acceptance  the ability to maintain existing and enter into new collaborative relationships  competing technological and market developments  the progress of distributors commercialization efforts  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement issues  and other factors 
to satisfy its capital requirements  the company may seek to raise funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders and debt financing may involve significant restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements to raise additional funds may require the company to relinquish its rights to certain of its technologies  products or marketing territories 
there can be no assurance that any such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of government regulation 
the research  development  manufacture and marketing of the company s products are extensively regulated by the fda  which requires its approval of drugs and medical devices before they can be marketed in the united states 
similar approvals are also required from other regulatory bodies in foreign countries 
the regulatory processes established by these government agencies are lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
in addition  once approval is obtained  that approval may be withdrawn 
the company has received approval from the fda on its nda for iontocaine  and the fda has allowed the company to market its iontophoretic dose controllers and electrode products for use with ions of soluble salts or other drugs under the fda s k regulations governing medical devices 
however  in  the fda publicly stated that it intends to require manufacturers of iontophoretic devices to obtain pmas for marketed devices currently used with drugs not specifically labeled for iontophoretic delivery  which would include the company s dose controller for use with ions of soluble salts or other drugs  such as dexamethasone 
the agency to date has not published such a regulation 
if the fda calls for pmas for preamendment class iii iontophoretic devices  the company would be required to have a pma accepted for filing by the fda within days after the date of the final regulation calling for pmas 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to complete and file a pma within the prescribed time period  or that the fda would approve it 
the company s failure to submit a pma within the required timeframe could result in the company being required to cease commercial distribution of the phoresor for use with any drug other than iontocaine 
any interference with the company s ability to distribute its phoresor system for use with dexamethasone would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
even if the company obtains regulatory approval  a marketed product  its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities and pertinent operations are subject to extensive regulation and periodic inspections 
discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility could result in fda sanctions  restrictions on a product or manufacturer  or an order to withdraw and or recall a specific product from the market 
there can also be no assurance that changes in the legal or regulatory framework or other subsequent developments will not result in the limitation  suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals granted to the company 
such events  were they to occur  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company and certain of its suppliers are also required to comply with us and foreign regulations governing manufacturing practices  which mandate procedures for extensive control and documentation of product design  control and validation of the manufacturing process and overall product quality 
if the company or its suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations regarding these manufacturing practices  the company could be subject to sanctions 
under the fda s regulations  when a manufacturer changes or modifies a device for which it has received a k clearance  it is required to obtain an additional k clearance for the modified device if the modification significantly affects the safety or efficacy of the device  or if the modification results in a major change in intended use 
in such cases  the manufacturer is expected to make the initial determination as to whether the modification is of a kind that would require a new k clearance 
the fda s regulations provide only limited guidance in making this determination 
the fda has cleared the company s iontophoretic dose controller and electrode kits for marketing under a k clearance 
since obtaining its k clearances  the company has made modifications to its products 
based on the checklist developed by the fda to assist manufacturers in determining whether they are required to obtain a k clearance for a modified device  the company has determined that a new k submission was not required in connection with the commercial introduction of such products 
however  there can be no assurance that the fda will not require the company to obtain additional k clearances with respect to those products 
if the fda requires the company to submit a new k notice for any device modification  the company may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until the k notice is cleared by the fda 
the company may be required to comply with other proposed and new us and foreign regulations governing its current and future products 
there can be no assurance that proposed and new regulations will not have a materially adverse effect on the company 
dependence on single sources of supply 
a key material used in many of the company s current electrode products is available only from a single supplier 
in addition  the company obtains iontocaine from abbott laboratories under a contract which may be terminated with six months notice 
the company also has the right to obtain dexamethasone from luitpold pharmaceuticals  inc american regent laboratories  inc 
under a contract expiring in january the company believes that  if necessary  alternative sources can be developed or alternate materials can be substituted for each of these single sourced materials 
although the company has not experienced difficulty acquiring these materials on commercially reasonable terms and in sufficient quantities to maintain required production levels  no assurance can be given that price increases or interruptions in the supply of these materials will not occur in the future or that the company will not have to seek alternate suppliers or obtain substitute materials  which may require additional product validations and regulatory submissions 
any significant price increase  interruption of supply  inability to secure an alternate source or qualify a substitute material could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval of its products 
the company s current dose controllers are manufactured under a contract with a third party electronics manufacturer 
there can be no assurance that its present supplier can manufacture sufficient quantities of dose controllers that meet quality and performance standards on a timely basis 
if the supplier cannot meet the company s requirements  or in the event of an interruption of its supply  the company would be required to identify  qualify and validate an alternate supply source within a reasonable period of time 
limited manufacturing experience 
the company manufactures its iontophoretic drug delivery electrodes in quantities sufficient to satisfy its current level of product sales 
to meet increases in sales  the company may need to increase its production significantly beyond its present manufacturing capacity 
accordingly  the company may be required to increase its manufacturing capacity or to contract with another party to manufacture its products 
there can be no assurance the company can successfully increase its capacity on a profitable basis  or contract with another party on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
significant increases in production volume will likely require changes in the company s product and manufacturing process in order to facilitate increased automation of the company s production 
there can be no assurance such changes in products or processes or efforts to automate the company s manufacturing process will be successful 
the company believes its facilities operate in accordance with the quality system regulations currently prescribed by the fda and in substantial compliance with iso and ce mark standards 
the company has gmp audits conducted by a qualified  independent organization on a regular basis and is iso and ce mark certified 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to maintain such compliance  particularly if the scale of the company s manufacturing operations increases 
uncertainty of health care reimbursement 
the company s ability to commercialize its products successfully will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of those products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations in the united states and in foreign markets where the company s products will be sold and used 
third party payors can affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of the company s products by regulating the reimbursement they provide on the company s or competing products or therapies 
there can be no assurance such reimbursement will continue at present levels  if at all 
some insurance carriers do not reimburse health care providers for use of the company s products in certain applications 
furthermore  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of new health care products 
the company is unable to predict what adverse impact on the company  if any  additional government regulations  legislation or initiatives or changes by third party payors affecting reimbursement or other matters that may influence decisions to obtain medical devices may have 
retention and attraction of key employees 
the company is dependent on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific  managerial  manufacturing  engineering and sales and marketing personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the company s area of activity  and there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
the company does not carry key man insurance with respect to any of its executives or employees 
risk of product liability  product recalls and warranty claims  availability of insurance 
the testing  marketing and sale of drug delivery and related pharmaceutical products for use in humans involves unavoidable risks 
the use of the company s products in clinical trials and the sale of its products upon approval may expose the company to potential product liability resulting from the use of such products 
in addition  the existence of a product liability claim  a product recall or excessive warranty claims in any such case  whether arising from defects in design or manufacture or otherwise could have an adverse effect on the company s sales of that product or require a change in the indications for which it may be used 
product liability insurance in the company s industry is expensive and difficult to obtain 
although the company currently has product liability insurance  there can be no assurance the existing coverage is adequate 
the company will seek to maintain and appropriately increase its insurance coverage as its product sales increase and the clinical development of its new product applications progress 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain its current levels of insurance on acceptable terms  will be able to secure increased coverage as the commercialization of its products proceeds or that any particular level of insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
potential volatility of share price 
the market price of the company s common shares  like that of the common shares of many other drug delivery  pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and other high technology companies  is likely to be highly volatile 
factors such as fluctuations or volatility in the company s operating results  announcements of technological innovations  results of clinical trials or new commercial products by the company or competitors  regulatory developments in the united sates or foreign countries  changes in the current structure of health care financing and payment systems  developments in or disputes regarding patent or other proprietary rights  general market conditions  economic and other external factors may have a significant effect on the market price of the common shares 
in addition  sales of substantial amounts of common shares including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common shares
