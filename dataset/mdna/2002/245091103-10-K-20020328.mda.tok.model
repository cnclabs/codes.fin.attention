item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion of critical accounting policies the company makes estimates and assumptions in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more critical accounting policies employed by the company 
revenue recognition the company sells its products to chain drug stores  mass volume retailers  supermarkets and wholesalers 
sales of such products are principally denominated in us dollars 
the company s accounts receivable reflect the granting of credit to these customers 
the company generally grants credit based upon analysis of the customer s financial position and previously established buying and selling patterns 
the company does not bill customers for shipping and handling costs and  accordingly  classifies such costs as selling and administrative expense 
revenues are recognized and discounts are recorded when merchandise is shipped 
net sales are comprised of gross revenues less returns and trade discounts and allowances 
the company allows customers to return their unsold products when they meet certain criteria as outlined in the company s trade terms 
the company regularly reviews and revises  as deemed necessary  its estimates of reserves for future sales returns based primarily upon actual return rates by product and planned product discontinuances 
the company records estimated reserves for future sales returns as a reduction of sales  cost of sales and accounts receivable 
returned products which are recorded as inventories are valued based on estimated realizable value 
the physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors considered by the company in estimating realizable value 
actual returns  as well as estimated realizable values of returned products  may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
co operative advertising and promotional allowances the company has various performance based arrangements with retailers to reimburse them for all or a portion of their promotional activities related to the company s products 
these arrangements primarily allow customers to take deductions against amounts owed to the company for product purchases 
estimated accruals for promotions and co operative advertising programs are recorded in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
the company regularly reviews and revises the estimated accruals for the projected costs for these promotions 
actual costs incurred by the company may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as the level and success of the retailers programs or other conditions differ from our expectations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
the company records adjustments to the cost of inventories based upon its forecasted plans to sell  historical scrap and disposal rates and the physical condition of the inventories 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  the timing of new product introductions  customer inventory levels  fashion oriented color cosmetic trends or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property  plant and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  fixtures  software or planned closing of facilities could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangibles other than goodwill  are reviewed by the company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
the company s estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  the company recognizes an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
pension benefits the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all eligible employees 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines and in conjunction with its actuarial consultants 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the expense and liability related to these plans 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants

item a market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments is the potential loss arising from material adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk the company s borrowings at december  under the revolving credit agreement expose earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are either variable or fixed for such a short period of time as to effectively become variable

such changes result in cumulative translation adjustments which are included in shareholders equity and in the determination of other comprehensive income loss
