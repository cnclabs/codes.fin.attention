overview novoste commenced operations as a medical device company in may since  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to developing the beta cath tm system 
the company commenced the active marketing of the beta cath tm system in europe in january for use in patients suffering from in stent restenosis  a condition in which coronary stents become clogged with new tissue growth 
on november   novoste received us marketing approval for the millimeter beta cath tm system from the fda and subsequently shipped its first commercial system on november  the number of commercial sites in the us increased rapidly throughout since our inception through june  we experienced significant losses in each period due to product development and clinical trial costs and  beginning in  the costs of launching the beta cath tm system in the us at december  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company experienced its first net operating profit in the third quarter of we expect to maintain an operating profit in as we continue to allocate resources to leverage our existing manufacturing operations  both internally and with outside vendors  expect our sales and marketing efforts in support of united states market development to level off as a percent of net sales and anticipate that our administrative activities to support our growth will remain at a constant level 
at the same time we will continue to conduct clinical trials and research and development projects in order to expand the opportunities for our technology 
the company also faces intense competition in the field of vascular brachytherapy with companies that have significantly greater capital resources than novoste including johnson johnson and guidant 
both johnson johnson and guidant have introduced vascular brachytherapy products that compete with our beta cath tm system 
a new technology called drug coated stents pose additional competitive threats in treating restenosis 
we may not be able to sustain an acceptable level of market demand for the beta cath tm system if this technology is successfully introduced 
failing to sustain our current level of demand could significantly reduce revenues and affect our ability to remain profitable 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we adopt and follow certain accounting policies 
certain amounts presented in the financial statements have been determined based upon estimates and assumptions 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results will differ and could be material 
we have included below a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements  how we apply such policies  and how results differing from our estimates and assumptions would affect the amounts presented in our financial statements 
other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements  and some of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses all our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recorded when an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company earns revenue from sales of catheters and from license and lease agreements to use the radiation source trains and transfer devices included in the beta cath tm system 
novoste uses distributors in countries where the distributors experience and knowledge of local radiation and medical device regulatory issues is considered beneficial by the company s management 
under the distributor arrangements  there are no purchase commitments and no provisions for cancellation of purchases 
novoste or the distributor may cancel the distributor agreements at any time 
revenue from sales of catheters directly to hospitals is recognized upon shipment once the hospital has leased a beta cath tm system and completed all licensing and other requirements to use the system 
the company recognizes revenue from sales of catheters to distributors at the time of shipment 
the company retains ownership of the radiation source trains and transfer devices and enters into either a lease or license agreement with its customers 
revenue recognition begins once an agreement has been executed  the system has been shipped  and all licensing and other requirements to use the system have been completed 
the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
the terms of the operating lease signed with customers located in the united states requires  as dictated by fda regulatory approval  replacement and servicing of the radiation source train and transfer device at six month intervals 
no other post sale obligations exist 
radiation and transfer devices and amortization of costs the company retains ownership of the radiation source trains rsts and transfer devices tds that are manufactured by third party vendors 
the costs to acquire  test and assemble these assets are recorded as incurred 
the company has determined that based upon experience  testing and discussions with the fda the estimated useful life of rsts and tds exceeds one year and is potentially as long as four years 
accordingly  the company classifies these assets as long term assets 
depreciation of the costs of these assets is included in cost of sales and is recognized over their estimated useful lives  currently months  using the straight line method 
depreciation begins once the beta cath tm system is placed into service 
valuation allowances are recorded for tds and rsts that are not available for use by a customer 
the company has invested significant resources to acquire rsts and tds that make up the beta cath tm system and offers multiple treatment length catheters each of which requires a different td and rst 
the acquisition of these various length systems are based upon demand forecasts made based upon available information from sales and marketing 
if actual demand were less favorable or of a different mixture of treatment lengths than those projected by management  additional valuation allowances might be required which would negatively impact operating profits 
stock based compensation novoste applies the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
as permitted by sfas  the company accounts for stock options grants in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants to employees for which the terms are fixed 
the company grants stock options generally for a fixed number of shares to employees  directors  consultants and independent contractors with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant 
compensation expense is recognized for increases in the estimated fair value of common stock for any stock options with variable terms 
the company accounts for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
any compensation expense related to grants that do not vest immediately is amortized over the vesting period of the stock options using the straight line method as that methodology most closely approximates the way in which the option holder earns those options 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for the estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
most of our customers are hospitals located in the us  however  some are distributors of our products in foreign countries or hospitals located in europe 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  additional allowances may be required 
allowances are also maintained for future sales returns and allowances based on an analysis of recent trends of product returns 
inventories novoste values its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out fifo basis 
provisions are recorded for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the cost of the inventory 
shelf life expiration or replacement products in the marketplace may cause product obsolescence 
if actual product demand and market conditions were less favorable than those projected by management  additional provisions might be required which would negatively impact operating profits 
novoste evaluates the adequacy of these provisions quarterly
