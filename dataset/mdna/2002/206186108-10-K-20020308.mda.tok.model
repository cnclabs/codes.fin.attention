firstsense is a provider of applications performance and service level management software designed for distributed applications  including packaged  custom and e business applications 
impact of the september  terrorist attacks the terrorist attacks of september  had an adverse impact on our business as license and services revenue from both the new york city area and the united states government decreased following the attacks 
these areas are a significant source of revenue for us and we are unable to determine when the local economies will recover 
we are currently unable to quantify the effect of the september  terrorist attacks on our business 
our daily operations excluding sales operations were not materially impacted by the terrorist attacks 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in the management discussion and analysis section of their annual report on form k 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following three accounting policies fit this definition revenue recognition  accounts receivable and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition policy we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier and the delivery terms are fob concord 
all revenues generated from our worldwide operations are approved at our corporate headquarters  located in the united states 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transaction is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are usually to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we usually recognize revenue upon receipt of cash 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and usually recognize revenue upon receipt of cash 
for all sales  we use either a purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our resellers are usually evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
this means that we defer revenue from the fee arrangement equivalent to the fair values of the undelivered elements 
we determine fair values for ongoing maintenance and support obligations using our internal pricing policies for maintenance and by referencing the prices at which we have sold separate maintenance contract renewals to our customers 
we determine fair values of services  such as training or consulting  by referencing the prices at which we have separately sold comparable services to our customers 
our arrangements do not generally include clauses involving acceptance of our products by our customers 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  revenue recognition occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
accounts receivable policy we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on a percentage of our accounts receivable  our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
accounting for income taxes policy as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
to do this  we estimate our actual current tax liabilities  while also assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgement is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards from prior years 
we are unsure whether we will have sufficient future taxable income to allow us to use these net operating losses  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation 
establishing new or additional valuation allowances could materially adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
our net deferred tax assets as of december  were million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgement in their application 
there are also areas in which the exercise of management s judgement in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k and which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the period indicated  certain financial data as percentages of concord s total revenue 
all prior period financial statements have been restated to reflect the acquisitions of empire technologies  inc and firstsense software  inc

software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  software license revenues are recognized upon execution of a contract and delivery of software  provided that the license fee is fixed and determinable  no significant production  modification or customization of the software is required and collection is considered probable by management 
revenues under multiple element arrangements  which typically include software products and maintenance sold together  are allocated to each element using the residual method in accordance with sop service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
maintenance revenues are derived from customer support agreements generally entered into in connection with initial license sales and subsequent renewals 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance 
total revenues total revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to license revenues concord s license revenues are derived from the licensing of software products 
license revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to license revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in license revenues in absolute dollars from to is due  to some extent  from the events of september  and the general slowdown of the economy in the united states and abroad which negatively affected it infrastructure spending 
the increase in license revenues in absolute dollars from to resulted from increased penetration of the international markets  sales to new customers and additional sales to existing customers for new products 
the decrease in license revenues as a percent of total revenues from to was the result of the decline of license revenue combined with a significant increase in service revenues  consisting mainly of maintenance revenues 
the decrease in license revenues as a percent of total revenues from to was due to a slower growth in license revenues versus an increase in the growth of service revenues 
there were no material price increases for products during service revenues concord s service revenues consist of fees for maintenance  training and professional services 
service revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to service revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in service revenues was mainly due to a significant increase in maintenance revenue which is generated from new and renewed maintenance contracts 
an increase in the number of the company s customers and the resulting demand for these services further helped drive the increase in service revenue from to and from to at december   concord had over  customers worldwide 
international revenues concord recognized million  million and million of revenues from international locations in  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
our revenues from international locations were primarily generated from customers located in europe 
revenues from customers located in europe accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the continued increase in revenues from international locations as a percentage of total revenues is primarily the result of concord s expansion of its operations outside the united states  which has included both the hiring of additional personnel as well as the establishment of additional reseller relationships 
we believe that continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of our sales  marketing and customer service functions in international markets 
we expect to commit additional time and development resources to customizing our products and services for selected international markets 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes expenses associated with royalty costs  production  fulfillment and product documentation  along with personnel costs associated with providing customer support in connection with maintenance  training and professional services contracts 
royalty costs are composed of third party software costs 
cost of revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to cost of revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively  resulting in gross margins of  and in each respective period 
the increase in cost of revenues  as well as the decrease in the gross margin percentages  was primarily the result of a shift in the revenue mix from license to service revenues as well as an increase in customer support spending associated with service revenue to be more responsive to growing customer needs 
we expect to decrease our cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues  however  this will depend upon our royalty costs and our revenue growth  among other factors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in decreasing our cost of revenues either on an absolute basis or as a percentage of total revenues 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with software development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and from to research and development expenses accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
increases in our research and development costs were primarily due to higher compensation expenses associated with software developers and development support personnel  as well as associated benefits and facilities costs 
headcount in research and development was  and people in  and respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future and that product development expenses may increase in absolute dollars in future periods  however  we intend to decrease our research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
our ability to decrease these expenses as a percentage of revenue will depend upon our revenue growth  among other factors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in decreasing our cost of revenues either on an absolute basis or as a percentage of total revenues 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions to sales personnel and agents  travel  tradeshow participation  public relations and other promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to sales and marketing expenses accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of increased headcount needed to build the direct sales force along with strong channel partners to penetrate the market 
additionally  the costs to market a multi product  multi market solution set are higher than the single product  single market solution sold in prior years 
headcount in sales and marketing was  and people in  and respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to sales and marketing in the future and that sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars in future periods  however  we intend to decrease our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
our ability to decrease these expenses as a percentage of revenue will depend upon our revenue growth  among other factors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in decreasing our cost of revenues either on an absolute basis or as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for financial  accounting  legal  administrative and management personnel 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to general and administrative expenses accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
from to  the increase in absolute dollars is attributable to increased administrative fees such as legal fees and accounting costs necessary to support the growth of our international operations 
from to  the increase in absolute dollars is due mainly to the increase in personnel and an increase in administrative costs and bad debt expenses 
headcount in general and administrative was  and people in  and respectively 
we expect to decrease these expenses as a percentage of revenue  this will ultimately depend upon our revenue growth  among other factors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in decreasing our cost of revenues either on an absolute basis or as a percentage of total revenues 
asset impairment charge concord acquired a million interest in broadband investment group broadband in september in exchange for our products and services 
in november  broadband publicly announced that it was ceasing operations and liquidating its remaining assets following its inability to raise additional capital due to unfavorable market conditions 
as a result  concord recorded a charge of approximately million to write off its investment in broadband 
the remainder of the carrying value of our broadband investment was reversed against the related deferred revenue for services not yet rendered 
stock based compensation stock based compensation relates to the issuance of stock options with exercise prices below the deemed fair value of the company s common stock at the date of grant 
the company recorded a reversal of deferred stock based compensation of approximately  and million related to the forfeiture of unvested stock options and restricted stock in and respectively 
deferred stock based compensation represents the difference between the stock option exercise price and the deemed fair value of the company s common stock at the date of grant and is reported as deferred compensation  a component of stockholders equity deficit 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized through charges to operations over the vesting period of the options  which is generally four years 
stock based compensation was approximately   and million in  and respectively 
acquisition related charges acquisition related charges incurred in included accounting  legal and investment banking fees associated with the acquisition of firstsense 
similar charges were incurred in for the acquisition of empire technologies  inc these acquisition related charges were approximately million and  in and  respectively  and they accounted for and of total revenues in and  respectively 
other income  net other income consists of interest earned on funds available for investment net of interest expense in connection with the financing of capital equipment in concord realized net other income of million  million and million  respectively  in  and income taxes in  the company did not provide for domestic federal income taxes as a result of the net loss incurred 
the company did provide approximately  primarily related to foreign taxes resulting from the profitability of certain of the company s foreign operations 
in  the difference between the expected combined federal and state tax rate of approximately and concord s effective tax rate relates primarily to the use of currently generated tax credits  favorable tax rates on international sales and previously unrecognized net operating loss carryforwards  partially offset by non deductible acquisition costs 
the effective tax rate approximates the combined statutory rate 
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt the company recognized an extraordinary loss of  net of the related tax benefit of  in related to the early extinguishment of certain debt that the company assumed as a part of the first sense acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources concord has financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and a credit line for equipment purchases 
concord had working capital of million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
accounts receivable decreased million from to due to lower license revenue 
deferred revenue increased from to by million due to an increase of the company s installed base  million of this increase came from deferred maintenance contracts and million was the result of service and software license sales with remaining contingencies such as completion of services and credit worthiness 
investing activities consisted of the acquisition of property and equipment  most notably computer and networking equipment to support the corporate infrastructure  and also investments in marketable securities 
concord manages its market risk on its marketable securities by selecting investment grade securities with the highest credit ratings with relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets 
financing activities consisted primarily of the issuance of common stock from the exercise of options during  and and from the repayments in of borrowings on a subordinated debt financing by firstsense 
pursuant to the tax reform act of  the utilization of net operating loss nol carryforwards for tax purposes may be subject to an annual limitation if a cumulative change of ownership of more than occurs over a three year period 
as a result of the company s preferred stock financings  such a change in ownership occurred 
as a result of this ownership change  the use of the nol carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change will be limited 
the company has determined that its initial public offering did not cause another ownership change 
as a result of the company s ownership change described above  the utilization of certain of the company s nol carryforwards is limited to only  per year 
the substantial majority of the company s nol carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change will expire before they can be used 
as of december   the company has determined that approximately  of these nol carryforwards will become unrestricted prior to their expiration 
the remainder of the company s previous nols generated prior to the change in ownership will expire prior to becoming unrestricted and have been written off against the valuation allowance 
in addition  the utilization of approximately million of nol carryforwards that were acquired as a result of the firstsense acquisition is also restricted as a result of a prior ownership change of firstsense 
utilization of the firstsense nol carryforwards is limited to million per year 
the company has deferred tax assets of approximately million  the largest component of which represents nol carryforwards and research and development credits 
the company has partially reserved for these deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance of million 
the resulting net deferred tax asset is based on the company s estimate of nol carryforwards it expects to use in the next two years  all other tax assets have been fully reserved 
pursuant to paragraphs to of sfas no 
 the company considered both positive and negative evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance at december  and the factors that weighed most heavily on the company s decision to record a valuation allowance were i the substantial restrictions on the use of certain of its existing nol and credit carryforwards and ii the uncertainty of future profitability 
in addition  the company is subject to rapid technological change  competition from substantially larger competitors  a limited family of products and other related risks  as more thoroughly described in the risk factors section of the company s form k 
as a result  the company found the evidence described above to be the most reliable objective evidence available in determining that a valuation allowance against its tax assets would be necessary 
as of december   the company s nol deferred tax asset includes approximately million pertaining to the benefit associated with the exercise and subsequent disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options by the company s employees 
when and if the company realizes this asset  the resulting change in the valuation allowance will be credited directly to additional paid in capital  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
during the year ended december  and  the company received a tax benefit of approximately  and million  respectively  pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options 
the company recorded this benefit as a component of additional paid in capital 
as a result of the uncertainty of the realizability in  the company did not record a tax benefit to additional paid in capital related to the exercise of employee stock options during the year ended december  as of december   concord s principal sources of liquidity included cash and marketable securities 
we believe that our current cash and marketable securities and cash provided by future operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent concord experiences growth in the future  our operating and investing activities may require significant cash 
consequently  any such future growth may require concord to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments concord does not invest in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
all of our investments are in investment grade securities with high credit ratings of relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets and are carried at fair value on our books 
accordingly  concord has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures concord s primary market risk exposure is in the area of interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
substantially all of our business outside the united states is conducted in us dollar denominated transactions  whereas our operating expenses in our international branches are denominated in local currency 
we have no foreign exchange contracts  option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements 
we believe that the operating expenses of our foreign operations are immaterial  and therefore any associated market risk is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
concord s current export sales are denominated in united states dollars 
to the extent that international sales continue to be denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of united states dollar relative to other currencies could make our products and services more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in international markets
