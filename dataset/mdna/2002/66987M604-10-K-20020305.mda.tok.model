item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following comments should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in this annual report 
see business risks and uncertainties for risks and uncertainties that could cause our future financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from historical financial conditions and operating results 
see also the discussion below under the caption industry trends and other factors influencing future results of operations 
overview we are a provider of wireless data access solutions 
since our inception in april  we have been focused on the development and commercialization of two way wireless data communications technologies 
we launched our nrm oem module in september  our sage and first minstrel products in  our minstrel iii wireless modem and expedite wireless modem in april and our merlin type ii wireless modem in august in addition  we announced our minstrel v wireless modem for the palm v handheld computing device in october  our lancer w modem in april  the minstrel for the hp jornada pocket pc in october  the minstrel s for the handspring visor in october and the merlin wireless pc card for metricom s kbps ricochet network in november we announced various new products in  including the minstrel m for the palm m  the merlin g  the merlin g  the merlin g  the merlin c  and the expedite g 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our product development  sales and marketing and professional services departments  and to establish our administrative infrastructure 
historically  our operating expenses have exceeded the revenue generated by our products and services 
as a result  we have incurred net operating losses in each quarter since our inception and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  in addition  we have experienced significant fluctuations in our number of employees from as of december  to over during fiscal and decreased to as of december  revenue 
we generate revenue from the sale of wireless modems to wireless telecommunications operators  wireless data content and service providers  resellers and oem customers 
we also generate revenue from product activation services we provide prior to shipping  although this source of revenue has not been significant through december  revenue from product sales and services  which includes product activation  is recognized upon the later of transfer of title or upon shipment of the product to the customer or upon rendering product activation services  if applicable 
revenue from long term supply contracts is recognized as products are shipped to customers 
we record deferred revenue for cash payments received from customers in advance of product shipment 
we grant price protection provisions to certain customers and we track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions 
to date  the company has not incurred material price protection expenses 
we establish reserves for estimated product returns and warranty allowances in the period in which revenue is recognized 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue typically consists of material components  labor for system assembly and testing  product activations  technical support  warranty costs  royalties and overhead expenses 
we currently outsource our manufacturing operations to third parties to minimize our capital expenditures and to benefit from contract manufacturer economies of scale 
gross margin 
our overall gross margin  or revenue less cost of revenue  may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the availability and costs of components  shifts in product mix  the proportion of direct and indirect sales  anticipated decreases in average selling prices and our ability to manage manufacturing costs 
we have reported negative gross margins for and the first half of  since our margins were at or near break even levels based on contracted purchase and sales prices  and our cost of revenue includes costs to support operations well in excess of our revenue and units processed in anticipation of future growth 
we consider these excess capacity costs to be a period expense rather than a capitalizable inventory cost  and we account for them accordingly 
we had positive gross margins during the second half of this is primarily 
table of contents due to increased sales volume and changes in product mix and the introduction of additional contract manufacturers with lower costs 
in  gross margins were negative as a result of decreased sales volumes and due to significant charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist of employee compensation  related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
however  software development costs are capitalized after technological feasibility has been obtained 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to achieving our strategic product development and cost reduction objectives and  as a result  expect these expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses consist of employee compensation  sales commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and field service support and advertising and promotional materials 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist of employee compensation and related personnel expenses  recruiting and relocation expenses  professional and consulting fees  and other general corporate expenses 
stock based compensation expense 
we recorded cumulative deferred compensation expense of million as a result of stock options granted below fair value through december  this amount represents the difference between the exercise price of these stock option grants and the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock at the time of grant 
of this amount  we have amortized approximately million through december  we currently estimate that the remaining stock compensation expense from options granted or issued from our inception in april through december  will be million in  million in and  in assuming no cancellations or additional stock option grants below fair market value 
this expense has no impact on our cash flows 
with respect to the amortization of stock based compensation  we are using the attribute method prescribed by fasb interpretation no 
and sfas industry trends and other factors influencing future results of operations our consolidated results of operations may be adversely affected in and in future years by various factors outside of our control  including decreases in the demand for wireless technology products and decreases in demand for wireless access services for the transmission of data 
revenue 
our consolidated results of operations depends upon  among other things our ability to maintain and increase our sales volumes with existing customers  our ability to attract new customers for our product offerings  the demand for wireless technology access services and wireless technology products  including pdas  and the ongoing financial condition of our existing customers and suppliers 
we have entered into  and expect to continue to enter into  significant customer contracts for the development and supply of our products 
these contracts may place significant demands on our resources 
as a result  we expect research and development  sales and marketing and other costs relating to the development  manufacture and sale of our products to increase 
we also expect to continue to incur these expenses in periods prior to recognizing revenue from these contracts 
our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows were adversely affected during the year ended december  by decreases in demand for wireless products 
our business was particularly impacted adversely by the bankruptcy of metricom  which filed in july sales to metricom accounted for of our revenue for the first six months of and for the year ending december  our business was also impacted adversely by the bankruptcy of omnisky  which filed for bankruptcy in december 
table of contents sales to omnisky accounted for and of our revenue for the years ending december  and our failure to generate significant revenue from new or existing products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  or the inability to reduce manufacturing and or operating costs  will further adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be able to maintain or improve upon our historical sales volumes with our existing customers  or whether we will be able to attract new customers for our wireless technology products 
a continued decrease in demand for the services of our wireless service customers  could lead to a decrease in the demand for our wireless products used by these customers  ultimately adversely impacting our revenue  results of operations and cash flows 
operating costs and expenses 
as discussed in item i  business manufacturing  through calendar  we experienced relatively tight supply of various components  including printed circuit boards  molded plastic components  unique metal components and asics 
we purchase these components from suppliers for which alternative sources have not been currently available in the quantities and at the prices that we require 
we cannot predict whether we will continue to experience limited supplies of certain components used in our manufacturing process 
if the availability of these or other components used in the manufacture of our products was to decrease  or if the prices for these components was to increase significantly  our operating costs and expenses could be adversely affected 
we continue to monitor and focus on reducing our operating costs and expenses and  as a result of our restructuring efforts  we have reduced our operating costs and expenses 
if our operating costs and expenses were to increase significantly  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected

the net loss for increased million  or  to million compared to million in liquidity and capital resources we believe that our available cash reserves  which include proceeds from the series a redeemable and convertible preferred stock financing in december  together with our operating cash flows and available borrowings under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund operations and to meet our working capital needs and anticipated capital expenditures through fiscal there can be no assurance that we will become profitable or generate positive cash flows 
if we fail to significantly increase revenues and reduce costs  we will continue to experience losses and negative cash flows from operations 
consequently  we may be required to seek additional financing in the future 
we cannot predict with any certainty as to if or when we might need to seek additional financing  however  management believes such financing will not be required before if we need additional financing there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all

on february   metricom  inc filed a claim in bankruptcy court regarding an alleged million preferential transfer for payments that metricom made to us during the day period prior to metricom s july filing for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
metricom is attempting to avoid the alleged preferential transfer and to force us to return these payments to metricom 
we have not received any correspondence from the bankruptcy court handling metricom s bankruptcy filing regarding metricom s claim

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we generally place our cash and short term investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us government obligations and corporate obligations with contractual maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we do not expect any material loss from our cash or cash equivalents and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material  however  these investments are subject to interest rate risk

as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our line of credit
