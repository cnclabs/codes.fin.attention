we experienced significant reductions in new premium sales during due to the cessation of new business generation in all states and as a result of market concerns regarding our insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus 
under our corrective action plan  which was recently approved by the pennsylvania insurance department the department  we intend to limit new business growth to levels that will allow us to maintain sufficient statutory surplus 
our underwriting practices rely upon the base of experience that we have developed in over years of providing nursing home care insurance  as well as upon available industry and actuarial information 
as the home health care market has developed  we have encouraged our customers to purchase both nursing home and home health care coverage  thus providing our insureds with enhanced protection and broadening our policy base 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the states in which they are licensed to write insurance 
these laws and regulations govern matters such as payment of dividends  settlement of claims and loss ratios 
state regulatory authorities must approve premiums charged for insurance products 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries are required to establish and maintain reserves with respect to reported and incurred but not reported losses  as well as estimated future benefits payable under our insurance policies 
these reserves must  at a minimum  comply with mandated standards 
for a description of current regulatory matters affecting our insurance subsidiaries  see liquidity and capital resources subsidiary operations 
our results of operations are affected significantly by the following other factors level of required reserves for policies in force 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating historical claims experience and statistical information with respect to the probable number and nature of such claims 
claim reserves reflect actual experience through the most recent time period 
we compare actual experience with estimates and adjust our reserves on the basis of such comparisons 
revisions to reserves are reflected in our current results of operations through benefits to policyholders 
we also maintain reserves for policies that are not currently on claim based upon actuarial expectations that a policy may go on claim in the future 
these reserves are calculated based on factors that include estimates for mortality  morbidity  interest rates and persistency 
factor components generally include assumptions that are consistent with both our experience and industry practices 
policy premium levels 
we attempt to set premium levels to maximize profitability 
premium levels on new products  as well as rate increases on existing products  are subject to government review and regulation 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
in connection with the sale of our insurance policies  we defer and amortize a portion of the policy acquisition costs over the related premium paying periods of the life of the policy 
these costs include all expenses that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of the policy  including commissions  underwriting and other policy issue expenses 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac is determined using the same projected actuarial assumptions used in computing policy reserves 
dac can be affected by unanticipated terminations of policies because  upon such terminations  we are required to expense fully the dac associated with the terminated policies 
with the assistance of our consulting actuary  we reviewed the appropriateness and recoverability of dac 
we determined that we require premium rate increases on a majority of our existing products in order to fully recover our present dac from future profits 
we recognized a dac impairment loss of  during primarily as a result of the additional cost projected for our new reinsurance agreement  including investment management fees  excise taxes and expense and risk charges 
in the event that premium rate increases cannot be obtained as needed  our dac would be further impaired and we would incur an expense in the amount of the impairment 
see net policy acquisition costs deferred 
the number of years a policy has been in in force 
claims costs tend to be higher on policies that have been in force for a longer period of time 
as the insured ages  it is more likely that the insured will need services covered by the policy 
however  the longer the policy is in effect  the more premium we receive 
investment income 
our investment portfolio consisted primarily of investment grade fixed income securities 
income generated from this portfolio is largely dependent upon prevailing levels of interest rates 
due to the duration of our investments approximately years  investment interest income does not immediately reflect changes in market interest rates 
subsequent to december  and in connection with a reinsurance agreement  we transferred a significant portion of our investment portfolio to our reinsurer 
under our new reinsurance agreement  substantially all of our investable assets were transferred to the reinsurer 
the reinsurer will maintain a notional experience account for our benefit that includes these assets and all future cash flows from the reinsured business 
we will record an investment credit on this experience account based upon the total return of a series of benchmark indices and hedges  which are designed to closely match the duration of reserve liabilities 
lapsation and persistency 
factors that affect our results of operations include lapsation and persistency  both of which relate to the renewal of insurance policies 
lapsation is the termination of a policy by non renewal 
lapsation is automatic if and when premiums become more than days overdue although  in some cases  a lapsed policy may be reinstated within six months 
persistency represents the percentage of premiums renewed  which we calculate by dividing the total annual premiums at the end of each year less first year premiums for that year by the total annual premiums in force for the prior year 
for purposes of this calculation  a decrease in total annual premiums in force at the end of any year would be the result of non renewal of policies  including policies that have terminated by reason of death  lapsed due to nonpayment of premiums and or been converted to other policies we offered 
first year premiums are premiums covering the first twelve months a policy is in force 
renewal premiums are premiums covering all subsequent periods 
policies renew or lapse for a variety of reasons  both internal and external 
we believe that our efforts to address policyholder concerns or questions help to ensure policy renewals 
we also believe that we enjoy a favorable reputation among policyholders for providing desirable policy benefits and efficient claims processing 
we work closely with our licensed agents  who play an integral role in policy conservation and policyholder communication 
external factors also contribute to policy renewal or lapsation 
economic cycles can influence a policyholder s ability to continue the payment of insurance premiums when due 
we believe that tax relief for certain long term care insurance premiums and other governmental initiatives  which have raised public awareness of the escalating costs of long term care  increase new sales and renewal payments 
the ratings assigned to our insurance subsidiaries by independent rating agencies also influence consumer decisions 
lapsation and persistency can both positively and adversely impact future earnings 
reduced lapses and higher persistency generally result in higher renewal premiums and lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs  but may lead to increased claims in future periods 
higher lapsation can result in reduced premium collection and a greater percentage of higher risk policyholders  but requires us to fully expense deferred acquisition costs relating to lapsed policies in the period in which policies lapse 
results of operations twelve months ended december  and dollars in thousands premiums 
total premium revenue earned in the twelve month period ended december   including long term care  disability  life and medicare supplement  decreased to  compared to  in the twelve month period ended december  total premium in the period was reduced by  as a result of premium ceded for the reinsurance of our disability product line 
total first year premiums earned in decreased to  compared to  in first year long term care premiums earned in decreased to  compared to  in we experienced significant reductions in new premium sales due to the cessation of new business generation in all states during the third and fourth quarters and as a result of the market s concerns regarding our insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus 
effective september   we discontinued the sale  nationally  of all new long term care insurance policies until our corrective action plan was completed and approved by the department 
this decision resulted from our concern about further depletion of statutory surplus from new sales prior to the completion and approval of the corrective action plan and from increasing concern regarding our financial status expressed by many states in which we are licensed to conduct business 
under our corrective action plan  we intend to limit future new business growth to levels that will allow us to maintain sufficient statutory surplus 
see liquidity and capital resources 
since the approval of our corrective action plan on february   we have recommenced sales in states and are continuing efforts to recommence in all states upon individual state approvals 
total renewal premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in renewal long term care premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in this increase reflects renewals of a larger base of in force policies  as well as a continued increase in policyholder persistency 
net investment income 
net investment income earned during increased to  from  for management attributes this growth to an increase in invested assets  which resulted from premium receipts and from the investment of additional funds generated from our rights offering 
our average yield on invested assets at cost  including cash and cash equivalents  was in  compared to in the average yield is lower due to reduced market rates for reinvesting of maturing investments and due to higher cash balances held during net realized capital gains and trading account activity 
during  we recognized capital losses of  compared to capital gains of in the results of both years were recorded due to realized gains and losses from our normal investment management operations and from impairment losses of approximately  in and  in on equity and debt securities  which we deemed to be other than temporary 
at december   we entered a reinsurance agreement for which a substantial portion of our investment portfolio was later ceded as the initial premium for this agreement 
as a result of this intended transfer or sale of assets  we determined that all gross unrealized losses on our debt and equities securities would not be recovered and therefore were deemed other than temporary impairments 
we recognized a loss of  from this determination 
we classified our convertible bond portfolio as trading account investments as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

changes in trading account investment market values are recorded in our statement of operations during the period in which the change occurs  rather than as an unrealized gain or loss recorded directly through equity 
therefore  we recorded a trading account loss in of  which reflects the unrealized and realized loss of our convertible portfolio that arose during the year ended december  we sold all of our convertible bond investments during other income 
we recorded  in other income during  up from  in the increase is attributable to an increase of commissions earned by united insurance group on sales of insurance products underwritten by unaffiliated insurers and to income generated from corporate owned life insurance policies 
benefits to policyholders 
total benefits to policyholders in decreased to  compared to  in our loss ratio  or policyholder benefits to premiums  was in  compared to in we review the adequacy of our deferred acquisition costs on an annual basis  utilizing assumptions for future expected claims and interest rates 
if we determine that the future gross profits of our in force policies are not sufficient to recover our deferred acquisition costs  we recognize a premium deficiency and unlock or change our original assumptions and reset our reserves to appropriate levels using new asumptions 
in  we recognized a premium deficiency and we unlocked our prior reserve assumptions 
these assumptions include interest rates  premium rates  shock lapses and anti selection of policyholder persistence 
as a result  reserves for benefits to policyholders was decreased by approximately  in  due to anticipated premium rate increases  which were only partially offset by changes in discounts rates  lapse assumptions and future claims assumptions 
claims experience can differ from our expectations due to numerous factors  including mortality rates  duration of care and type of care utilized 
when we experience adverse deviation from our estimates  we typically seek premium rate increases that are sufficient to offset future deviation 
during  we filed premium rate increases on the majority of our policy forms in a majority of states 
these rate increases were sought as a result of higher claims expectations and policyholder persistency than existed at the time of the original form filings 
the assumptions used in requesting and supporting the premium rate increase filings are consistent with those incorporated in our newest policy form offerings 
we have been generally successful in the past in obtaining state insurance department approvals for increases 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining rate increases when deemed necessary  or if we do not pursue rate increases when actual claims experience exceeds our expectations  we could suffer a financial loss 
due to the inherent uncertainty in establishing reserves  it has been necessary in the past for us to increase the estimated future liabilities reflected in our reserves for claims and policy expenses 
in the year in which a claim is first incurred  we establish policy and contract claims reserves that are actuarially determined to be the present value of all future payments required for that claim 
we assume that our current reserve amount and interest income earned on invested assets will be sufficient to make all future payments 
we evaluate our prior year assumptions by reviewing the development of reserves for the prior period 
this amount   and  in and  respectively  includes imputed interest from prior year end reserve balances plus adjustments to reflect actual versus estimated claims experience 
these adjustments particularly when calculated as a percentage of the prior year end reserve balance provide a relative measure of deviation in actual performance as compared to our initial assumptions 
in  excluding the effect of imputed interest  we added approximately  to our claim reserves for and prior claim incurrals  and in  we added approximately  to our claim reserves for and prior claim incurrals 
our additions to prior year incurrals in resulted from a continuance study performed by our consulting actuary 
in  we also increased claim reserves by an additional  as a result of utilizing a lower interest rate for the purpose of discounting our future liabilities 
we also inreased our claim reserves approximately  during by increasing our loss adjustment expense reserve  which is established for the funding of administrative costs associated with the payment of current claims 
over time  it may continue to be necessary for us to increase our reserves 
commissions 
commissions to agents decreased to  in  compared to  in first year commissions on accident and health business in decreased to  compared to  in  due to the decrease in first year accident and health premiums 
the mix of policyholder issue ages for new business affects the percentage of commissions paid for new business due to our age scaled commission rates 
generally  sales to younger policyholders result in a higher commission percentage 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in and in renewal commissions on accident and health business in increased to  compared to  in  consistent with the increase in renewal premiums discussed above 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in and in  which varies as a result of the weighting of policies written by agents with differing contracts 
during and  we reduced commission expense by netting  and  respectively  from override commissions that affiliated insurers paid to our subsidiary agencies 
the reduction in commission overrides earned by these agencies in resulted from our suspension of new sales in all states at varying times throughout net policy acquisition costs amortized deferred and impairment of dac 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs in decreased to a net amortization of  compared to net deferrals of  in deferred costs typically include all costs that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of policies 
these costs include the variable portion of commissions  which are defined as the first year commission rate less ultimate renewal commission rates  and variable general and administrative expenses related to policy underwriting 
deferred costs are amortized over the life of the policy based upon actuarial assumptions  including persistency of policies in force 
in the event a policy lapses prematurely due to death or termination of coverage  the remaining unamortized portion of the deferred amount is immediately recognized as expense in the current period 
the amortization of deferred costs is generally offset largely by the deferral of costs associated with new premiums generation 
lower new premium sales during produced significantly less expense deferral to offset amortized costs 
during  with the assistance of our consulting actuary  we completed an analysis to determine if existing policy reserves and policy and contract claim reserves  together with the present value of future gross premiums  would be sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and settlement and maintenance costs and recover unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs  referred to as recoverability analysis 
we determined that we would require premium rate increases on certain of our existing products in order to fully recover our present deferred acquisition cost asset from future profits 
we perform the recoverability analysis each quarter 
during the second quarter we recognized an impairment charge of as a result of this analysis 
effective december   we entered a reinsurance agreement for substantially all of our long term care insurance policies 
the reinsurance agreement includes an annual expense and risk charges 
these additional expense and risk charges reduced our anticipated future gross profits and resulted in a further impairment of our deferred policy acquisition cost asset of  we also amortized approximately  more of deferred acquisition cost asset during due to changing our future assumptions 
see premiums 
when an impairment occurs  the historical assumptions utilized is the establishment of the reserves and dac are unlocked and based on current assumptions 
changes in policy reserves and unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs will be based on these revised assumptions in future periods 
in determining the impairment  we evaluated future claims expectations  premium rates and our ability to obtain future rate increases  persistency and expense projections 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in decreased to  compared to  in the amounts for the years ended and  respectively  include  and  related to united insurance group 
the ratio of total general and administrative expenses  excluding united insurance group expense  to premium revenues was in  compared to in general and administrative expenses were increased during as a result of supplemental accounting and actuarial fees  legal fees  depreciation expenses and the recognition of of compensation expense related to the variable treatment of options granted to employees 
the compensation expense represents the december  market value of our common stock in excess of the grant price of the options 
throughout we took certain actions to reduce costs  including staff eliminations  marketing reductions and overhead eliminations 
we believe that if we remain unable to write new business in states where we have ceased new production  we will need to decrease production expenses further 
as a result of our december  reinsurance agreement with a foreign reinsurer  we must pay federal excise tax of on all ceded premium 
at december   we accrued  of excise tax  which represents the total amount due for the transfer of premium at the inception of the agreement 
this amount was paid in the first quarter reserve for claim litigation 
in the second quarter  a jury awarded compensatory damages of and punitive damages of  in favor of the plaintiff in a disputed claim case against one of our subsidiaries  for which we had maintained a  reserve 
during the second quarter  we agreed to settle the claim  and reversed the remaining reserve balance 
provision for federal income taxes 
our provision for federal income taxes for decreased to a tax benefit of  compared to a tax provision of  for as a result of net losses in during  we determined that the net operating loss carryforward attributable to our non life parent may be impaired due to the life subsidiary s inability to utilize these losses within the allowed future periods 
as a result  we recognized a valuation allowance of  to our deferred tax asset in comprehensive income 
during  our investment portfolio generated pre tax  unrealized gains of  compared to  in after accounting for deferred taxes from these gains  shareholders equity decreased by  from comprehensive losses during  compared to comprehensive income of  in twelve months ended december  and dollars in thousands premiums 
total premiums earned in the twelve month period ended december   including long term care  disability  life and medicare supplement  increased to  compared to  in the twelve month period ended december  first year long term care premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in we attribute our growth to continued improvements in product offerings  which competitively meet the needs of the long term care marketplace  and growth from recent expansion into new states  such as new jersey  connecticut and new york 
in addition  we introduced our group plan  which offers long term care insurance to group members on a guaranteed acceptance basis 
group plan sales accounted for approximately  in first year premium 
we believe that our growth was otherwise hampered during as a result of the introduction of higher priced products in many states and unfavorable press reports regarding the long term care industry and our company as a market leader 
renewal premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in renewal long term care premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in this increase reflects renewals of a larger base of in force policies and policyholder persistency  which remained constant at approximately  as well as rate increases 
net investment income 
net investment income earned for increased to  from  for management attributes this growth to an increase in invested assets as a result of higher established reserves 
investment income was reduced  however  by our use of  of invested cash for the acquisition of network insurance senior health division on january  our average yield on invested assets at cost  including cash and cash equivalents  was in  compared to in average yields generally increased due to cash from maturing bonds invested at higher rates 
these yields are reduced as a result of investments in equity securities  which generate low or no dividend yields 
net realized capital gains 
during  we recognized capital gains of  compared to gains of  in capital gains and losses are generally recorded as a result of our normal investment management operations 
at december   however  we realized a capital loss of  by marking the cost basis of one of our bonds to its current market value 
the issuer of this bond declared bankruptcy  which prompted the bond s impairment 
in  we recognized capital gains to offset expenses of approximately  as a result of the impairment of certain of our fixed assets as discussed below 
other income 
we recorded  in other income during  up from  in the increase is attributable to the partial settlement of a previously disclosed lawsuit  the details of which are confidential in accordance with the settlement agreement  and to income generated from corporate owned life insurance policies 
benefits to policyholders 
total benefits to policyholders in increased to  compared to  in our loss ratio  or policyholder benefits to premiums  was in  compared to in this ratio is expected to grow as new business premiums as a percentage of total premiums decreases 
claims experience can differ from our expectations due to numerous factors  including mortality rates  duration of care and type of care utilized 
when we experience adverse deviation from our estimates  we typically seek premium rate increases that we estimate will be sufficient to offset future deviation 
we have been generally successful in the past in obtaining state insurance department approvals for increases 
policyholder benefits include additions to reserves and claims payments for policyholders incurring claims in the current and prior years 
in  we paid  related to current year incurrals and  related to claims incurred in and prior years 
in  we paid  for current year claims and  related to prior year incurrals 
paid claims as a percentage of premiums were in  compared to in this ratio increased as a result of aging policies and a reduction in new premium as a percentage of total premium reduction 
in the year in which a claim is first incurred  we establish reserves that are actuarially determined to be the present value of all future payments required for that claim 
we assume that our current reserve amount and interest income earned on invested reserves will be sufficient to make all future payments 
we measure the validity of our prior year assumptions by reviewing the development of reserves for the prior period ie  incurred from prior years 
this amount   and  in and  respectively  includes imputed interest from prior year end reserve balances of  and  respectively  plus adjustments to reflect actual versus estimated claims experience 
these adjustments  particularly as a percentage of the prior year end reserve balance  yield a relative measure of deviation in actual performance to our initial assumptions 
in  we added approximately  or of prior year end reserves to our claim reserves for and prior claim incurrals 
in  we added approximately  or of prior year end reserves to our claim reserves for and prior claim incurrals 
commissions 
commissions to agents increased to  in  compared to  in first year commissions on accident and health business in decreased 
to  compared to  in  due primarily to the lack of commissions paid for our new group policies 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in and in  which also reflects the lack of group product commissions 
the mix of policyholder issue ages for new business affects the overall percentage of commissions paid for new business due to our age scaled commission rates 
generally  sales to younger policyholder have a higher commission percentage 
renewal commissions on accident and health business in increased to  compared to  in  consistent with the increase in renewal premiums discussed above 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in and in this ratio fluctuates in relation to the age of the policies in force and the rates of commissions paid to the producing agents 
commission expense during was reduced by the netting of  from override commissions paid to our insurance agency subsidiaries by affiliated insurers 
during  commissions were reduced by  in  override commission reductions included approximately  from the insurance agency that we purchased in january net policy acquisition costs deferred 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs in decreased to  compared to  in although new premiums increased in  lower first year commissions from our group product line resulted in lower deferred acquisition costs 
in addition  amortization of previously deferred costs offsets a greater portion of the current period deferral  especially when new premium growth slows  as has been the case in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in increased to  compared to  in in and general and administrative expenses included  and  respectively  related to united insurance group 
generally  costs such as premium taxes and salaries related to business processing increase proportionately to premium growth 
management believes that current cost savings initiatives  such as remote office consolidation and outsourcing of certain administrative functions  has helped to contain the level of our expenses 
expenses increased due to the depreciation of capitalized costs for new internal software development  legal expenses and sales promotion expense 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premiums excluding united insurance group and goodwill amortization related to its purchase were in  compared to in loss due to impairment of property and equipment 
during  we discontinued the implementation of a new computer system 
at june   we had capitalized  of expenditures related to this project  including licensing costs and fees paid to outside parties for system development and implementation 
as the system was not yet in service  none of these costs had previously been depreciated 
when we decided not to use these fixed assets  their value became fully impaired and we recognized the entire amount as current period expense 
in conjunction with our decision to discontinue our implementation of this computer system  we filed suit against the software manufacturer and several consultants  alleging misrepresentations regarding the system s capabilities and ability to meet our expectations 
we have settled a portion of the lawsuit in exchange for payment of an undisclosed amount 
however  we continue to seek a judgment against two additional parties who acted as consultants on the project 
reserve for claim litigation 
in april  a jury awarded compensatory damages of and punitive damages of  in favor of the plaintiff in a disputed claim case against one of our subsidiaries 
the trial judge granted our motion for a new trial or a remitter of the award to  the plaintiff appealed the judge s order 
the result of the plaintiff s appeal could be  among other things  a reinstatement of the jury verdict or confirmation of the judge s order granting us a new trial 
we have established a  reserve pending the outcome of this case 
provision for federal income taxes 
our provision for federal income taxes for increased to  compared to  for the effective tax rates of and in and  respectively  are at or below the normal federal corporate rate as a result of credits from our investments in tax exempt bonds and corporate owned life insurance and dividends we receive that are partially exempt from taxation and are partially offset by non deductible goodwill amortization and other non deductible expenses 
comprehensive income 
during  our investment portfolio generated pre tax unrealized gains of  compared to unrealized losses of  after accounting for deferred taxes from these gains  shareholders equity increased by  from comprehensive income during  compared to comprehensive income of  in liquidity and capital resources dollars in thousands our consolidated liquidity requirements have historically been created and met from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries  from our agency subsidiaries and from funds raised in the capital markets 
our primary sources of cash are premiums  investment income and maturities of investments 
we have obtained  and may in the future obtain  cash through public offerings of our common stock  other capital markets activities or debt instruments 
our primary uses of cash are policy acquisition costs principally commissions  payments to policyholders  investment purchases and general and administrative expenses 
our report of independent accountants contained a going concern opinion resulting from doubt regarding our parent company liquidity and insurance subsidiary statutory surplus 
our report of independent accountants no longer contains a going concern opinion given the steps that we have been able to accomplish 
however  we cannot make assurances that our future statutory surplus and parent liquidity will not again produce doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern without additional resources in the future 
see parent company operations 
in  our cash decreased by  primarily from funds used to purchase bonds and equity securities of  our cash was primarily increased by proceeds from the sale and maturity of investment securities of  these sources of funds were supplemented with  from operations and  generated from the issuance of common stock in our rights offering 
in  our cash increased by  primarily due to the maturity and sale of  of our bond and equity securities portfolio 
these sources of funds were supplemented with  from operations 
the major source of cash from operations was premium revenue used to fund reserve additions of  the primary uses of cash during were the purchase of  in bonds and equity securities   paid as agent commissions and  used to purchase network insurance senior health division 
in  our cash decreased  primarily due to  used to purchase bonds and equity securities   used to purchase our common stock  which is held as treasury stock  and  used to purchase united insurance group 
cash was provided primarily from the maturity and sale of  in bonds and equity securities 
these sources of funds were supplemented with  from operations 
the major provider of cash from operations was premium revenue used to fund reserve additions of  we invest in securities and other investments authorized by applicable state laws and regulations and follow an investment policy designed to maximize yield to the extent consistent with liquidity requirements and preservation of assets

subsidiary operations in thousands our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by various state insurance departments 
in its ongoing effort to improve solvency regulation  the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks  such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that an insurer must maintain 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which may require specific corrective action depending upon the insurer s state of domicile 
our subsidiaries are required to hold statutory surplus that is  at a minimum  above a calculated mandatory control level at which the pennsylvania insurance department the department would be required to place our subsidiary under regulatory control  leading to rehabilitation or liquidation 
insurers are obligated to hold additional statutory surplus above the mandatory control level 
at december   our primary insurance subsidiary  representing of our direct premium  had total adjusted capital at the regulatory action level 
as a result  it was required to file a corrective action plan the plan with the insurance commissioner 
subsequent to december   the department approved the plan 
as a primary component of the plan  effective december   we entered a reinsurance transaction to reinsure  on a quota share basis  substantially all of our respective long term care insurance policies then in force 
the agreement was entered with centre solutions bermuda limited  which is rated a by am best 
the agreement  which is subject to certain coverage limitations  meets the requirements to qualify as reinsurance for statutory accounting  but not for generally accepted accounting principles 
the initial premium of the treaties is approximately  comprised of  of cash and qualified securities transferred subsequent to december   and  as funds heldo due to the reinsurer 
the initial premium and future cash flows from the reinsured policies  less claims payments  ceding commissions and risk charges  will be credited to a notional experience account  which is held for our benefit in the event of commutation and recapture on or after december  the notional experience account balance will receive an investment credit based upon the total return of a series of benchmark indices and hedges that are intended to match the duration of our reserve liability 
the agreement contains commutation provisions and allows us to recapture the reserve liabilities and the current experience account balance as of december  or on december of any year thereafter 
if we choose not to or are unable to commute the agreement as planned  our financial results would likely suffer a materially adverse impact due to an escalation of the charges paid to the reinsurer 
additionally  our reinsurance provisions contain significant covenants and conditions that  if breached  could result in a significant loss  requiring a payment of million per quarter from the period of the breach through december  any breach of the reinsurance agreement may also result in the immediate recapture of the reinsured business  which would have a material adverse effect on our subsidiaries statutory surplus 
management has completed an assessment of its ability to avoid any breach through and believes that it will remain compliant 
in addition  the reinsurer has been granted warrants to acquire convertible preferred stock in the event we do not commute the agreements that  if converted  would represent an additional percent of the common stock then outstanding 
pennsylvania insurance regulations require that funds ceded for reinsurance provided by a foreign or unauthorized reinsurer must be secured by funds held in a trust account or by a letter of credit for the protection of policyholders 
we received approximately  in statutory reserve credits from this transaction as of december   of which  was held by us and  was backed by letters of credit  which increased our statutory surplus by  as well 
as a result  our subsidiary s rbc ratio at december  was substantially above the required statutory minimum  as well as above recommended or trigger levels 
the initial premium paid for the reinsurance in february included investment securities carried at amortized cost but valued at market price for purposes of the premium transfer and the experience account 
the pennsylvania insurance department permitted us to receive credit of  for the letters of credit  and to accrue the anticipated  yet unknown  gain of  from the sale of securities at market value  in our statutory financial results for december  the impact of this permitted practice served to increase the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries by approximately  at december  had we not been granted a permitted practice  our statutory surplus would have been negative 
upon finalization of the reinsurance agreement  transfer of funds and establishment of appropriate letters of credit in the first quarter of  the permitted practices are not expected to be required 
the plan requires our subsidiary to comply with certain other agreements at the direction of the department  including  but not limited to o new investments are limited to naic or rated securities 
o affiliated transactions are limited and require department approval 
o an agreement to increase statutory reserves which is the responsibility of the reinsurer by an additional  throughout  such that our policy reserves will be based on new  current claims assumptions and will not include any rate increases 
these claim assumptions are applied to all policies  regardless of issue year and are assumed to have been present since the policy was first issued 
our subsidiary insurers will be subject to continued surplus strain as a result of new business as well as a reduced level of premium to support our general and administrative expenses 
we believe that our surplus will continue to be sufficient and that our rbc ratio at december  will be above the naic company action level 
we expect to seek other sources of additional capital to supplement our statutory surplus 
effective september   we determined to discontinue the sale nationally of all new long term care insurance policies until the plan was approved by the department 
the decision resulted from our concern about further depletion of statutory surplus from new sales prior to the completion and approval of the plan and from increasing concern regarding our status by many states in which we are licensed to conduct business 
the form of our cessation varied by state  ranging from no action to certificate suspensions 
upon the approval by the department of the plan in february  we recommenced new sales in states 
we have since recommenced sales in additional states 
we are actively working with all states in order to recommence sales in all remaining jurisdictions 
the majority of our insurance subsidiaries cash flow results from our existing long term care policies  which will be ceded to the reinsurer under this agreement 
our subsidiaries ability to meet additional liquidity needs and fixed expenses in the future is highly dependent upon our ability to issue new policies and to control expense growth 
we have historically utilized financial reinsurance arrangements to mitigate the surplus strain caused by the new business growth 
as a result of these arrangements  penn treaty network america s ptna statutory surplus was increased by  these arrangements are designed to be paid over a relatively short period of time 
as a result of these repayment provisions and our commutation of all existing treaties during  all of the surplus benefit derived from the financial reinsurance treaties reversed during fiscal our new reinsurance agreement meets the requirements necessary to qualify as reinsurance for statutory accounting 
since it does not have an accelerated repayment provision  we do not consider it to be financial reinsurance 
the agreement does not create a material probability of loss for the reinsurer  and accordingly does not qualify for reinsurance under generally accepted accounting principles and is not reflected as such in our financial statements 
the agreement contains commutation provisions and allows us to recapture the reserve liabilities and the current experience account balance as of december  or on december of each any thereafter 
we have an intent and desire to commute the treaty on december  and we are accounting for the agreement in anticipation of this commutation 
in the event we do not commute the agreement on december   we will be subject to escalating expenses 
our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand our historical markets  retain and expand our network of agents and effectively market our products and our ability to fund our marketing and expansion while maintaining minimum statutory levels of capital and surplus required to support such growth 
under the insurance laws of pennsylvania and new york  where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  insurance companies can pay dividends only out of earned surplus 
in addition  under pennsylvania law  our pennsylvania insurance subsidiaries including our primary insurance subsidiary must give the pennsylvania insurance department at least days advance notice of any proposed extraordinary dividend and cannot pay such a dividend if the insurance department disapproves the payment during that day period 
for purposes of that provision  an extraordinary dividend is a dividend that  together with all other dividends paid during the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s surplus as shown on the company s last annual statement filed with the insurance department or its statutory net income as shown on that annual statement 
statutory earnings are generally lower than earnings reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles due to the immediate or accelerated recognition of all costs associated with premium growth and benefit reserves 
additionally  the plan requires the department to approve all dividend requests  regardless of statutory allowances 
under new york law  our new york insurance subsidiary must give the new york insurance department days advance notice of any proposed dividend and cannot pay any dividend if the regulator disapproves the payment during that day period 
in addition  our new york insurance company must obtain the prior approval of the insurance department before paying any dividend that  together with all other dividends paid during the preceding twelve months  exceeds the lesser of of the insurance company s surplus as of the preceding december or its adjusted net investment income for the year ended the preceding december during  we received a dividend from our new york subsidiary of our subsidiaries debt currently consists primarily of a mortgage note in the amount of approximately  that was issued by a former subsidiary and assumed by us when that subsidiary was sold 
the mortgage note is currently amortized over years  and has a balloon payment due on the remaining outstanding balance in december although the note carries a variable interest rate  we have entered into an amortizing swap agreement with the same bank with a nominal amount equal to the outstanding debt  which has the effect of converting the note to a fixed rate of interest of 
parent company operations in thousands we are a non insurer that directly controls of the voting stock of our insurance company subsidiaries 
if we are unable to meet our financial obligations  become insolvent or discontinue operations  the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance company subsidiaries could be materially affected 
on april   we distributed rights to our shareholders and holders of our convertible subordinated notes due rights offering for the purpose of raising new equity capital 
pursuant to the rights offering  holders of our common stock and holders of our convertible subordinated notes received rights to purchase  newly issued shares of common stock at a set price of per share 
the rights offering was completed on may  and generated net proceeds of  in additional equity capital 
we contributed  of the net proceeds to the statutory capital of our subsidiaries 
parent company debt currently consists of  of convertible subordinated notes due  as well as an installment note in the amount of  issued in connection with the purchase of united insurance group 
the convertible subordinated notes  issued in november  are convertible into common stock at per share until maturity in december at maturity  to the extent that the convertible subordinated notes have not been converted into common stock  we will have to repay their entire principal amount in cash 
the convertible subordinated notes carry a fixed interest coupon of  payable semi annually 
because we do not have sufficient cash flow to retire the debt upon maturity  and the conversion price of per share is not likely to be met  we expect that we will need to refinance our convertible subordinate notes on or before maturity in the terms of any such refinancing are not yet known  or if refinancing is achievable 
we cannot give assurance that these terms will not be materially adverse to our existing shareholders interests 
on january   we purchased all of the common stock of united insurance group  a michigan based consortium of long term care insurance agencies  for  as part of the purchase  we issued a note payable for  which was in the form of a three year zero coupon installment note 
the installment note  after discounting for imputed interest  was recorded as a note payable of  and had an outstanding balance of  at december  the remainder of the purchase was paid in cash 
the total outstanding balance of the note was repaid in january our total debt and financing obligations through are as follows lease debt commitments total total    amounts subsequent to are immaterial 
in december  we contributed  to initially capitalize another subsidiary  which concurrently lent us in exchange for a demand note  which is still outstanding 
at december   we had a  line of credit from a bank  which was unused 
the line of credit was not renewed by the bank at december  as part of our reinsurance agreement  effective december   the reinsurer was granted four tranches of warrants to purchase non voting shares of convertible preferred stock 
the first three tranches of convertible preferred stock are exercisable through december  at common stock equivalent prices ranging from to per share if converted 
if exercised for cash  at the reinsurer s option  the warrants could yield additional capital and liquidity of approximately  and would represent  if converted  of approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
if the agreement is not commuted on or after december   the reinsurer may exercise the fourth tranche of warrants for common stock equivalent prices of per share if converted  potentially generating additional capital of  representing an additional of the then outstanding common stock 
no assurance can be given that the reinsurer will exercise any or all of the warrants granted 
cash flow needs of the parent company primarily include interest payments on outstanding debt and limited operating expenses 
the funding is primarily derived from the operating cash flow of our agency subsidiary operations and dividends from the insurance subsidiaries 
however  as noted above  the dividend capabilities of the insurance subsidiaries are limited and the only insurance company that can pay dividends is american independent network insurance company of new york 
while we intend to sell this insurance subsidiary in order to generate additional parent company liquidity  we cannot assure that this will be accomplished during in the event the sale is not completed  we may need to rely upon the dividend capabilities of our agency subsidiaries to meet current liquidity needs 
these sources of funds  however  are expected to be insufficient to meet our future needs beyond june   including the repayment of million of long term debt in december in march  we completed an equity placement of shares of unregistered common stock for net proceeds of approximately  the equity placement included current and new institutional investors  with shares offered at 
the offering price was a percent discount to the day average price prior to the issuance 
we have agreed to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on or before june  to register these shares for resale 
the proceeds of the equity placement are expected to provide sufficient additional liquidity to the parent company to meet our debt obligations prior to the maturity of the convertible debt in the proceeds  together with currently available cash sources  are not sufficient to meet the december final interest requirement of the debt or to retire the debt upon maturity 
our liquidity projections  while based upon our best estimates and containing excess margin for our estimated needs  may not be sufficient to meet our obligations throughout we cannot assure that we will not need additional funding in the event that our liquidity projections are insufficient to meet our future cash needs 
new accounting principles in thousands effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 which we transferred its convertible bond portfolio from the available for sale category to the trading category 
theses bonds were sold during december we are party to an interest rate swap agreement  which converts its mortgage loan from a variable rate to a fixed rate instrument 
we determined that the swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
the notional amount of the swap is approximately  the effects have been determined to be immaterial to the financial statements 
our involvement with derivative instruments and transactions is primarily to mitigate its own risk and is not considered speculative in nature 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two statements of financial accounting standards sfas 
sfas no 
 business combinations requires usage of the purchase method for all business combinations initiated after june   and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations 
the provisions of sfas no 
relating to the application of the purchase method are generally effective for business combinations completed after june  such provisions include guidance on the identification of the acquiring entity  the recognition of intangible assets other than goodwill acquired in a business combination and the accounting for negative goodwill 
the transition provisions of sfas no 
require an analysis of goodwill  acquired in purchase business combinations prior to july   to identify and reclassify separately identifiable intangible assets currently recorded as goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
we will adopt sfas no 
on january  and will cease amortizing goodwill at that time 
all goodwill recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at january  will be assigned to one or more reporting units 
goodwill in each reporting unit will be tested for impairment by june  any impairment loss recognized as a result of this transitional impairment test of goodwill will be reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
our book value is currently in excess of our market value  which will require an analysis of the goodwill at the reporting unit level 
management has not yet completed this analysis to determine the extent of impairment  if any 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands we invest in securities and other investments authorized by applicable state laws and regulations and follow an investment policy designed to maximize yield to the extent consistent with liquidity requirements and preservation of assets 
a significant portion of assets and liabilities are financial instruments  which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate risk on fixed rate domestic medium term instruments and  to a lesser extent  domestic short term and long term instruments 
we have established strategies  asset quality standards  asset allocations and other relevant criteria for our portfolio to manage our exposure to market risk 
we currently have an interest rate swap on our mortgage  which is used as a hedge to convert the mortgage to a fixed interest rate 
we believe that  since the notional amount of the swap is amortized at the same rate as the underlying mortgage and both financial instruments are with the same bank  no credit or financial risk is carried with the swap 
our financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
our portfolio does not contain any significant concentrations in single issuers other than us treasury and agency obligations  industry segments or geographic regions 
we urge caution in evaluating overall market risk from the information below 
actual results could differ materially because the information was developed using estimates and assumptions as described below  and because insurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables are excluded in the hypothetical effects insurance liabilities represent of total liabilities and reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses represent of total assets 
long term debt  although not carried at fair value  is included in the hypothetical effect calculation 
the hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of financial instruments as of december   excluding insurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses because such insurance related assets and liabilities are not carried at fair value  would have been as follows if interest rates had increased by basis points at december   there would have been a decrease of approximately  in the net fair value of our investment portfolio less our long term debt and the related swap agreement 
a basis point increase in market rates at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately  in the net fair value 
if interest rates had decreased by and basis points  there would have been a net increase of approximately  and  respectively  in the net fair value of our total investments and debt 
if interest rates had increased by basis points at december   there would have been a decrease of approximately  in the net fair value of our investment portfolio less our long term debt and the related swap agreement 
the change in fair value was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using models that measure the change in net present values arising from selected hypothetical changes in market interest rate 
a basis point increase in market rates at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately  in the net fair value 
if interest rates had decreased by and basis points  there would have been a net increase of approximately  and  respectively  in the net fair value of our total investments and debt 
we hold certain mortgage and asset backed securities as part of our investment portfolio 
the fair value of these instruments may react in a convex or non linear fashion when subjected to interest rate increases or decreases 
the anticipated cash flows of these instruments may differ from expectations in changing interest rate environments  resulting in duration drift or a varying nature of predicted time weighted present values of cash flows 
the result of unpredicted cash flows from these investments could cause the above hypothetical estimates to change 
however  we believe that the minimal amount we have invested in these instruments and their broadly defined payment parameters sufficiently outweigh the cost of computer models necessary to accurately predict the possible impact on our investment income of hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of financial instruments as of december  effective december   we entered a reinsurance agreement to reinsure  on a quota share basis  substantially all of our long term care insurance policies in force 
the transaction resulted in the transfer of debt and equity securities of approximately  to the reinsurer 
the agreements provide us the opportunity to commute and recapture after december  to that end  the reinsurer will maintain a notional experience account for our benefit only in the event of commutation and recapture  which reflects the initial premium paid  future premiums collected net of claims  expenses and accumulated investment earnings 
the notional experience account balance will receive an investment credit based upon the total return of a series of benchmark ndices and hedges that are designed to closely match the duration of reserve liabilities 
because we do not have controlling ownership of these assets  periodic changes in the market values of the benchmark indices and hedges will be recorded in our financial statements as gains or losses in the period in which they occur 
as a result  we will likely experience significant volatility in our future financial statements
