the gap table and related discussion included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  gives information on the repricing characteristics of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   and is incorporated herein by reference 
the dollar amounts of the company s income and interest expense fluctuate depending both on changes in the respective interest rates and on changes in the respective amounts volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to the yields earned and rates paid on the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

a the change in volume is calculated by multiplying the difference between the average balance of the current year and the prior year by the prior year s average yield 
the change in rate is calculated by multiplying the difference between the average yield of the current year and the prior year by the prior year s average balance 
the mixed changes in rate volume is calculated by multiplying the difference between the average balance of the current year and the prior year by the difference between the average yield of the current year and the prior year 
this amount is then allocated proportionately to the volume and rate changes calculated previously 
b the effects of interest rate swap activity have been included in income and expense of the related assets and liabilities 
c includes nonaccrual loans days or more past due 
competition and other matters the company experiences strong competition in both attracting deposits and making real estate loans 
competition for savings deposits has historically come from money market mutual funds  other savings institutions  commercial banks  and issuers of government and corporate debt securities 
in addition  traditional financial institutions have found themselves in competition with other financial services entities  such as securities dealers  insurance companies  credit unions  and others 
the principal methods used by the company to attract deposits  in addition to the interest rates and terms offered  include the offering of a variety of services and the convenience of office locations and hours of public operation 
competition in making real estate loans comes principally from other savings institutions  mortgage banking companies  and commercial banks 
many of the nation s largest savings institutions  mortgage banking companies  and commercial banks are headquartered or have a significant number of branch offices in the areas in which the company competes 
changes in the government s monetary  tax  or housing financing policies can also affect the ability of lenders to compete profitably 
the primary factors in competing for real estate loans are interest rates  loan fee charges  underwriting standards  and the quality of service to borrowers and their representatives 
in addition  the company competes indirectly with government sponsored enterprises  notably the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
thrift industry the operations of the thrift industry are significantly influenced by general economic conditions  by the related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and by the policies of financial institution regulatory authorities 
deposit flows and costs of funds are impacted by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending and other investment activities are affected by the demand for mortgage financing and for consumer and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting the supply of housing and the availability of funds 
regulation office of thrift supervision 
because they are federally chartered savings institutions  the principal regulator of both wsb and wtx is the ots 
under various regulations of the ots  savings institutions are required  among other things  to pay assessments to the ots  maintain required regulatory capital  maintain a satisfactory level of liquid assets  and to comply with various limitations on loans to one borrower  equity investments  investments in real estate  and investments in corporate debt securities that are not investment grade and comply with regulations governing deposits and mortgage loans 
federal deposit insurance corporation 
the fdic administers two separate deposit insurance funds  the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif 
each fund insures deposit accounts up to the maximum amount permitted by law  currently  per insured depositor 
the bif is a deposit insurance fund for commercial banks  federally chartered banks  and some state chartered banks 
the saif is a deposit insurance fund for most savings associations 
wsb is a member of the bif  but a portion of wsb s deposits are insured through the saif 
at december   of wsb s deposits were saif insured 
wtx s deposits are also insured by the fdic and wtx is a member of the bif 
as a result  wsb and wtx are subject to supervision  regulation  and examination by the fdic 
fdic insurance is required for all federally chartered financial institutions such as wsb and wtx 
such bif insurance may be terminated by the fdic under certain circumstances involving violations of regulations or unsound practices 
during  federal legislation was enacted to capitalize the saif in order to bring it into parity with the fdic s other insurance fund  the bif 
the new law required members to pay a levy of billion to bring the saif up to the required reserve level of of insured deposits  but lowered thrift deposit insurance premiums for saif members starting in as a result of this legislation  the company incurred a one time charge of million during the premiums paid for the years through were adjusted quarterly and premiums paid in were adjusted semi annually 
as of january   the premium paid by wsb and wtx to the fdic was 
per  federal reserve board 
federal reserve board regulations require financial institutions to maintain noninterest earning reserves against their checking accounts 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve board may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements 
wsb and wtx are currently in compliance with all applicable federal reserve board reserve requirements 
savings institutions have authority to borrow from the federal reserve bank but the federal reserve board requires savings institutions to exhaust all fhlb sources before borrowing from the relevant federal reserve bank 
regulatory capital 
the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of firrea established capital standards for federally insured financial institutions  such as wsb and wtx 
under firrea  thrifts must have tangible capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  core capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  and risk based capital equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
the ots and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules based upon five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the rules provide that a financial institution is well capitalized if its leverage ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  its total risk based capital ratio is or greater and the institution is not subject to a capital directive 
as used herein  the total risk based capital ratio is the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  the tier risk based capital ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets  and the tier or leverage ratio is the ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets  in each case as calculated in accordance with current ots capital regulations 
as of december   the most recent notification from the ots categorized wsb and wtx as well capitalized under the current requirements 
there are no conditions or events that have occurred since that notification that the company believes would have an impact on the categorization of wsb or wtx 
at december  and  wsb and wtx had the following regulatory capital calculated in accordance with firrea s capital standards table regulatory capital ratios  minimum capital requirements  and well capitalized capital requirements as of december  dollars in thousands well capitalized minimum capital capital actual requirements requirements capital ratio capital ratio capital ratio wsb and subsidiaries tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    wtx tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    table regulatory capital ratios  minimum capital requirements  and well capitalized capital requirements as of december  dollars in thousands well capitalized minimum capital capital actual requirements requirements capital ratio capital ratio capital ratio wsb and subsidiaries tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    wtx tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    the table below shows a reconciliation of wsb s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb and subsidiaries reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  unrealized gain on securities after tax  equity capital       direct investments  unrealized gain on securities after tax      general valuation allowance  qualifying subordinated debt  regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than the table below shows a reconciliation of wsb s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb and subsidiaries reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  unrealized gain on securities after tax  equity capital       direct investments  unrealized gain on securities after tax      general valuation allowance  qualifying subordinated debt  regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than the table below shows a reconciliation of wtx s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb texas reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  equity capital       general valuation allowance regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than the table below shows a reconciliation of wtx s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb texas reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  equity capital       general valuation allowance regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than federal home loan bank system 
the fhlb system functions in a credit capacity for its members  which may include savings associations  savings banks  commercial banks  and credit unions 
as members  wsb and wtx are required to own capital stock of an fhlb in an amount that depends generally upon their outstanding home mortgage loans or advances from such fhlb  and are authorized to borrow funds from such fhlb see borrowings 
capital distributions by savings institutions 
see item  market for the registrant s common stock and related security holder matters on page  for a discussion on certain limitations imposed by the ots on dividends paid by savings institutions 
during  wsb paid no upstream dividends to golden west 
limitation on loans to one borrower 
current law subjects savings institutions to the same loans to one borrower restrictions that are applicable to national banks with limited provisions for exceptions 
in general  the national bank standard restricts loans to a single borrower to no more than of a bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  plus an additional if the loan is collateralized by certain readily marketable collateral 
real estate is not included in the definition of readily marketable collateral 
at december   the maximum that wsb could have loaned to one borrower and related entities was million  while the largest amount of loans it had to one borrower was million 
at december   the maximum amount that wtx could have loaned to one borrower and related entities was million  while the largest amount of loans wtx had outstanding to any one borrower was million 
depositor priorities 
in the event of the appointment of a receiver of a federally chartered savings bank  such as wsb  based upon the failure of the savings bank to meet certain minimum capital requirements or the existence of certain other conditions  the federal deposit insurance act recognizes a priority in favor of holders of withdrawable deposits including the fdic subrogee or transferee over general creditors including holders of debt of wsb 
thus  in the event of a liquidation of wsb or a similar event  claims for deposits would have a priority over claims of holders of debt 
as of december   wsb had approximately billion of deposits outstanding 
powers of the fdic in connection with the insolvency of an insured depository institution 
if the fdic is appointed a receiver or conservator of an insured depository institution  such as wsb or wtx  the fdic may disaffirm or repudiate any contract or lease to which such institution is a party  the performance of which is determined to be burdensome  and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined to promote the orderly administration of the institution s affairs 
the fdic may contend that its power to repudiate contracts extends to obligations such as the debt of the depository institution  and at least one court has held that the fdic can repudiate publicly traded debt obligations 
the effect of any such repudiation could be to accelerate the maturity of debt 
such repudiation would likely result in a claim by each holder of debt against the receivership 
the claim may be for principal and interest accrued through the date of the appointment of the conservator or receiver 
alternatively  at least one court has held that the claim would be in the amount of the fair market value of the debt as of the date of the repudiation  which amount could be more or less than accrued principal and interest 
the amount paid on the claims of the holders of the debt would depend  among other factors  upon the amount of receivership assets available for the payment of unsecured claims and the priority of the claim relative to the claims of other unsecured creditors and depositors  and may be less than the amount owed to the holders of the debt 
see depositor priorities above 
if the maturity of the debt were so accelerated  and a claim relating to the debt paid by the receivership  the holders of the debt might not be able  depending upon economic conditions  to reinvest any amounts paid on the debt at a rate of interest comparable to that paid on the debt 
in addition  although the holders of the debt may have the right to accelerate the debt in the event of the appointment of a conservator or receiver of the depository institution  the fdic as conservator or receiver may enforce most types of contracts  including the debt pursuant to their terms  notwithstanding any such acceleration provision 
the fdic as conservator or receiver may also transfer to a new obligor any of the depository institution s assets and liabilities  without the approval or consent of the institution s creditors 
in its resolutions of the problems of an insured depository institution in default or in danger of default  the fdic is generally obligated to satisfy its obligations to insured depositors at the least possible cost to the deposit insurance fund 
in addition  the fdic may not take any action that would have the effect of increasing the losses to the relevant deposit insurance fund by protecting depositors for more than the insured portion of deposits generally  or by protecting creditors other than depositors 
existing law authorizes the fdic to settle all uninsured and unsecured claims in the insolvency of an insured institution by making a final payment after the declaration of insolvency 
such a payment would constitute full payment and disposition of the fdic s obligations to claimants 
existing law provides that the rate of such final payment is to be a percentage reflecting the fdic s receivership recovery experience

see new accounting pronouncements section on page golden west s principal subsidiary is world savings bank  fsb wsb 
wsb is headquartered in oakland  california 
at december   wsb had billion in assets 
at december   golden west had a savings network of branches in california  in florida  in colorado  in texas  in arizona  in new jersey  eight in kansas  five in illinois  and two in nevada 
by virtue of being federally chartered  wsb can originate mortgages anywhere in the nation  even though they may not be authorized to conduct deposit gathering business in those jurisdictions 
in addition to the states with savings operations referenced above  the company had lending operations in connecticut  delaware  georgia  idaho  indiana  kentucky  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  missouri  nebraska  new hampshire  new mexico  new york  north carolina  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  pennsylvania  rhode island  south carolina  south dakota  tennessee  utah  virginia  washington  wisconsin  and wyoming 
the savings accounts offered by wsb are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fdic administers two separate deposit insurance funds  the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif 
the bif is a deposit insurance fund for commercial banks  federally chartered savings banks  and some state chartered savings banks 
the saif is a deposit insurance fund for most savings associations 
wsb is a member of the bif  but a portion of wsb s deposits are insured through the saif 
wsb has a subsidiary  world savings bank  fsb texas wtx that is also a federally chartered savings bank 
wtx s deposits are also insured by the fdic and wtx is a member of the bif

atlas advisers  inc  is an investment adviser to the atlas family of mutual funds and atlas securities  inc  is the distributor of the atlas mutual funds and annuities 
the following narrative focuses on the significant financial statement changes that have taken place at golden west over the past three years and includes a discussion of the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity and capital resources 
financial condition the following table summarizes the company s major asset  liability  and equity components in percentage terms at yearends    and as the table shows  the largest asset component is the loan portfolio including mortgage backed securities  which consists primarily of long term mortgages 
deposits represent the majority of the company s liabilities 
table asset  liability  and equity components as percentages of the total balance sheet december assets cash and investments loans receivable including mortgage backed securities other assets liabilities and stockholders equity deposits fhlb advances securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
senior debt 



subordinated notes other liabilities stockholders equity asset liability management the company s earnings depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the amounts it receives from interest earned on loans  mbs  and investments and the amounts it pays in interest on deposits and borrowings 
therefore  the company s profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage credit risk see asset quality section on page and interest rate risk 
the company mitigates its credit risk through strict underwriting standards and loan reviews 
the company manages interest rate risk by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy 
such instruments are entered into solely to alter the repricing characteristics of designated assets and liabilities 
one measure of exposure to interest rate risk is the repricing gap  the difference between the repricing of assets and liabilities 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts 
the disparity between the repricing maturity  prepayment  or interest rate change of mortgage loans and investments and the repricing of deposits and borrowings can have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the following table shows the company s repricing gap at december  table repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  repricing gaps  and gap ratio as of december  dollars in millions projected repricing a over months months years years total interest earning assets investments mortgage backed securities   loans receivable rate sensitive    fixed rate   other b   impact of interest rate swaps total      interest bearing liabilities deposits c     fhlb advances   other borrowings  impact of interest rate swaps total     repricing gap      cumulative gap     cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets a based on scheduled maturity or scheduled repricing  loans and mbs reflect scheduled repayments and projected prepayments of principal based on current rates of prepayment 
b includes cash in banks and fhlb stock 
c liabilities with no maturity date  such as checking  passbook  and money market deposit accounts  are assigned zero months 
the table above shows that  as of december   the company s assets reprice sooner than its liabilities 
if all repricing assets and liabilities responded equally to changes in the interest rate environment  then the gap analysis would suggest that golden west s earnings would rise when interest rates increase and would fall when interest rates decrease 
however  golden west s earnings are also affected by the built in reporting and repricing lags inherent in the eleventh district cost of funds index cofi  which is the benchmark the company uses to determine the rate on the majority of its adjustable rate mortgages arms 
the reporting lag occurs because of the time it takes to gather the data needed to compute the index 
as a result  the cofi in effect in any month actually reflects the eleventh district s cost of funds at the level it was two months prior 
the repricing lag occurs because cofi is based on a portfolio of liability accounts  not all of which reprice immediately 
many of these liabilities  including certificates of deposit  don t reprice each month  and when they do reprice  may not reflect the full change in market rates 
some liabilities  such as low rate checking or passbook savings accounts  reprice very little 
still other liabilities  such as demand deposits  do not reprice at all 
therefore  cofi does not initially fully reflect a change in market interest rates 
consequently  when the interest rate environment changes  the cofi lags cause assets initially to reprice more slowly than liabilities  enhancing earnings when rates are falling and holding down income when rates rise 
additionally  the company originates loans that are tied to the golden west cost of savings index cosi 
the cosi in effect in any month reflects the actual rate on golden west s deposits at the prior monthend 
partially offsetting the impact of the index lags are similar lags on a portion of the company s liabilities 
in addition to the index lags  other elements of arm loans also have an impact on earnings 
these elements are introductory fixed rates on new arm loans  the interest rate adjustment frequency of arm loans  interest rate caps or limits on individual rate changes  and interest rate floors 
on balance  the index lags and arm structural features cause the company s assets initially to reprice more slowly than its liabilities  resulting in a temporary reduction in net interest income when rates increase and a temporary increase in net interest income when rates fall 
the table on the following page reflects the company s expected cash flows and applicable yields on the balances of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities as of december   and takes into consideration expected prepayments of the company s long term assets primarily mortgage backed securities and loans receivable and the estimated current fair value

total        a the total weighted average interest rate for variable loans receivable reflects loans with introductory rates in effect at december  those loans are assumed to mature outside the introductory period at fully indexed rates the fully indexed rate is equal to the effective index plus the loan margin 
consequently  the weighted average rate of all maturing variable rate loans will not equal the weighted average rate of total variable rate loans at december  as indicated in the total balance column 
b deposits with no maturity are included in the column 
golden west estimates the sensitivity of the company s net interest income  net earnings  and capital ratios to interest rate changes and anticipated growth based on simulations using an asset liability model which takes into account the lags previously described 
the simulation model projects net interest income  net earnings  and capital ratios based on an immediate interest rate increase that is sustained for a thirty six month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
for certain assets  the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on prepayment rates which are based on the company s historical prepayment information 
the model factors in projections for anticipated activity levels by product lines offered by the company 
based on the information and assumptions in effect at december   management believes that a basis point rate increase sustained over a thirty six month period would not affect the company s long term profitability and financial strength

allowance for loan losses the company provides specific valuation allowances for losses on loans when impaired and a write down on foreclosed real estate when any significant and permanent decline in value is identified 
the company also utilizes a methodology for monitoring and estimating loan losses that is based on both historical experience in the loan portfolio and factors reflecting current economic conditions 
this approach uses a database that identifies losses on loans and foreclosed real estate from past years to the present  broken down by year of origination  type of loan  and geographical area 
based on these historical analyses  management is then able to estimate a range of general loss allowances by type of loans and risk category to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
one to four single family real estate loans are evaluated as a group 
in addition  periodic reviews are made of individual major multi family and commercial real estate loans and foreclosed real estate 
where indicated  specific and general valuation allowances are established or adjusted 
in estimating probable losses inherent in the portfolio  consideration is given to the estimated sales price  cost of refurbishing the security property  payment of delinquent taxes  cost of disposal  and cost of holding the property 
additions to and reductions from the allowances are reflected in current earnings based upon quarterly reviews of the portfolio 
the review methodology and historical analyses are reconsidered quarterly

under firrea  thrifts and savings banks must have tangible capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  have core capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  and have risk based capital equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
the ots and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules based upon five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the rules provide that a savings association is well capitalized if its leverage ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  its total risk based capital ratio is or greater and the institution is not subject to a capital directive 
as used herein  the total risk based capital ratio is the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets  and the tier or leverage ratio is the ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets  in each case as calculated in accordance with current ots capital regulations

the company reported diluted eps of before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for the year ended december  as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net interest income the largest component of the company s revenue and earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans and other investments and the interest paid on customer deposits and borrowings 
long term growth of the company s net interest income  and hence earnings  is related to the ability to expand the mortgage portfolio  the company s primary earning asset  by originating and retaining high quality adjustable rate home loans 
over the short term  however  net interest income can be influenced by business conditions  especially movements in interest rates  which can temporarily accelerate or restrain net interest income changes 
net interest income amounted to billion and billion  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts represented and increases  respectively  over the previous years 
as discussed below  the significant growth of net interest income in compared with the prior year resulted from two principal factors the substantial growth of the mortgage portfolio during  and an increase in in the company s primary spread  which is the difference between the yield on loans and other investments and the rate paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income in benefited from the growth of the mortgage portfolio in the prior year 
specifically  in  the company originated a record loan volume that  in combination with a moderate level of mortgage repayments  resulted in unusually rapid growth of the company s loans receivable 
thus  there was a significantly larger average loan balance outstanding during versus  and this contributed to the substantial net interest income increase in net interest income increases in were also influenced by a temporary widening of the company s primary spread 
as noted in the discussion of the gap on page  the company s liabilities respond more rapidly to movements in short term interest rates than the company s assets  most of which are adjustable rate mortgages tied to indexes that lag changes in market interest rates 
consequently  when short term interest rates decline  the company s primary spread temporarily widens  because the index lags slow the downward movement of the yield on the company s adjustable rate mortgage portfolio 
when interest rates stabilize after a period of falling rates  the primary spread usually declines for a while as the yield on the arm portfolio continues to catch up to previous rate decreases 
the opposite occurs when interest rates increase 
specifically  when short term interest rates move up  the company s primary spread compresses for a period of time  because the index lags slow the upward adjustment of the yield on the company s arms 
when interest rates stabilize after a period of rising rates  the primary spread expands for a while as the arm yield continues to respond to previous rate increases 
for the five years ended december   which included periods of both falling and rising interest rates  the company s primary spread averaged with a high of and a low of 
during  the federal reserve s open market committee lowered the federal funds rate  a key short term interest rate  by a total of basis points 
other short term market rates experienced similar decreases 
in response to significantly lower short term interest rates  the company s cost of funds declined by basis points during the year ended december  this large drop occurred  in part  because the company used primarily adjustable market rate borrowings to fund the rapid expansion of the loan portfolio in as a result  a significant portion of the company s liabilities responded almost immediately to the sharp decrease in market rates in while the company s cost of funds declined considerably during  the yield on the company s assets fell by only basis points  because the indexes to which the large adjustable rate mortgage portfolio is tied moved down more slowly 
as a consequence  the company s primary spread widened substantially during  reaching  the highest in the company s history  and resulted in a temporary boost to net interest income in the following table shows the components of the company s primary spread at the end of the years through table yield on earning assets  cost of funds  and primary spread december yield on loan portfolio yield on investments yield on earning assets cost of deposits cost of borrowings cost of funds primary spread the company holds arms in order to manage the rate sensitivity of the asset side of the balance sheet 
the yield on the company s arm portfolio tends to lag changes in market interest rates principally because of lags related to the indexes 
most of the company s arms have interest rates that change in accordance with an index based on the cost of deposits and borrowings of savings institutions that are members of the fhlb of san francisco the cofi 
the company also originates loans that are tied to the golden west cost of savings index cosi 
as previously discussed  there is a two month reporting lag for the cofi and a one month reporting lag for cosi 
additionally  certain loan features cause the yield on the company s arm portfolio to lag changes in market interest rates 
these features include introductory fixed rates on new arm loans  the interest rate adjustment frequency of arm loans  interest rate caps or limits on individual rate changes  and interest rate floors 
on balance  the index lags and arm structural features cause the company s assets initially to reprice more slowly than its liabilities  resulting in a temporary reduction in net interest income when rates increase and a temporary increase in net interest income when rates fall

after tax per diluted share 
in addition to the one time charge  the company reported pre tax expense of million  or 
after tax per diluted share for the year ended december   associated with the ongoing valuation of the company s swaps 
this additional expense occurred because the market value of golden west s swaps declined during in conjunction with falling short term rates
