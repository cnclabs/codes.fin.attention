description of business 
we are a leading provider of land based contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas producers and operators in texas  new mexico  oklahoma  louisiana  mississippi  utah and western canada 
we own the second largest land based drilling fleet in north america with drilling rigs 
we provide drilling fluids  completion fluids and related services to oil and natural gas producers in the permian basin of west texas and southeast new mexico  south texas  east texas  oklahoma  the gulf coast regions of texas and louisiana  and the gulf of mexico 
drilling and completion fluids are used by oil and natural gas operators during the drilling process to control pressure when drilling oil and natural gas wells 
we also provide pressure pumping services in the appalachian basin 
these services consist primarily of well stimulation and cementing for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells 
to a lesser extent  we are engaged in the development  exploration  acquisition and production of oil and natural gas 
our oil and natural gas operations are not financially material and do not warrant disclosure as a business segment 
the contract drilling business experienced increased demand for drilling services from through most of due to higher oil and natural gas prices 
the increase in demand returned  beginning in mid and continued through the second quarter of however  except for those periods and other occasional upturns  the market for onshore contract drilling services and the other services we provide has generally been depressed since  when the number of operable land drilling rigs was at record levels 
since this time there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand in most operational and geographic segments of the north american land drilling industry 
as a result  drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins 
in addition to adverse effects that future declines in demand could have on patterson uti  ongoing factors which could adversely affect utilization rates and pricing  even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity  include movement of drilling rigs from region to region  reactivation of land based drilling rigs  or new construction of drilling rigs 
we cannot predict either the future level of demand for our contract drilling services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling business 
management estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
generally  revenues are recognized when services are performed 
we follow the percentage of completion method of accounting for footage contract drilling arrangements 
under this method  all drilling revenues  direct costs and appropriate portions of indirect costs  related to the contracts in progress  are recognized as contract drilling services are performed 
due to the nature of turnkey contract drilling arrangements and risks therein  we follow the completed contract method of accounting for such arrangements 
under this method  all drilling advances  direct costs and appropriate portions of indirect costs including maintenance and repairs related to the contracts in progress are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses in the period the contracts are completed 
provisions for losses on incomplete or in process contracts are made when estimated total costs are expected to exceed total estimated revenues 
related party transactions 
in  and  we leased a beech king air airplane owned by an affiliate of our chief executive officer and our president chief operating officer 
under the terms of the lease  we paid a monthly rental of  and our proportionate share of the costs of fuel  insurance  taxes and maintenance of the aircraft 
we paid approximately   and  for the lease of the airplane during  and  respectively 
an affiliate acted as the first purchaser of oil produced from certain leases we operated during sales of oil to that entity  both royalty and working interest were approximately million 
there were no sales of oil to that entity in or the company operates certain oil and natural gas properties in which our chief executive officer  our president chief operating officer  our chief financial officer and other affiliated persons or entities  purchased a joint interest ownership with us and other industry partners 
we made oil and natural gas production payments net of royalty of million  million and million from these properties in  and  respectively  to the aforementioned persons or entities 
these persons or entities reimbursed us for joint operating costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we paid approximately  to an entity owned by a relative of our president chief operating officer for certain equipment and metal fabrication services 
one of our directors is a director and an officer of a company from which we purchased drill pipe  materials and supplies totalling approximately million in this same director was an officer of a customer through february from which we received approximately  in revenues in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of approximately million including cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
for  our significant sources of cash flow were million derived from operations  million from the exercise of stock options and warrants  million of proceeds provided by a credit facility  and  from the sale of certain property and equipment 
correspondingly  we used a portion of the funds discussed above as follows million to repay notes payable  million as partial consideration in the acquisitions of jones drilling corporation and the assets of three related entities  the drilling rigs and certain other assets of cleere drilling company and six additional drilling rigs from three separate transactions  million to make capital expenditures for the betterment and refurbishment of our drilling rigs  as well as the acquisition and procurement of drilling equipment  including drill pipe  to fund leasehold acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties and to fund capital expenditures for our drilling and completion fluids and pressure pumping segments and million for the purchase of other long term assets 
during  we entered into five separate transactions  all accounted for as purchases  whereby we increased our land based drilling rig fleet to  an increase of rigs from a year ago 
a brief description of each of the transactions follows on december   we acquired drilling rigs and related equipment from cleere drilling company for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the purchase price consisted of million cash plus  shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the common stock was recorded at per share and the warrants were valued at per underlying share of our common stock using the black scholes option valuation model 
on january   we acquired jones drilling corporation and certain assets of three entities related to jones drilling corporation 
the acquired assets consisted of drilling rigs of which were then marketable and related equipment and approximately million of net working capital 
the purchase price of million consisted of  shares of the company s common stock valued at per share and million cash plus approximately  in transaction costs 
in january  we acquired six drilling rigs  through three separate transactions  for approximately million cash 
on february   patterson entered into an agreement and plan of merger with uti providing for the merger of the two entities 
on may   the stockholders of each company approved the merger  and the merger was consummated 
each outstanding share of uti common stock was converted into one share of patterson common stock and each option or warrant then outstanding representing the right to receive uti common stock was converted into the right to purchase patterson uti common stock on an equivalent basis 
a total of  shares of patterson common stock was issued pursuant to the merger and an additional  shares were reserved for issuance under the uti stock option plans 
additionally  our stockholders approved an increase in the authorized shares of our common stock from million to million and a name change to patterson uti energy  inc during  we repaid million under our existing credit facilities and other term obligations 
we incurred expenses of  as a result of prepayment penalties and  related to deferred financing costs which were unamortized at the time the debt was extinguished 
the penalties and deferred financing costs were included in restructuring and related charges during in june  we increased our existing revolving line of credit to million and extended the term of the facility to june the revolving line of credit carries a floating interest rate of libor plus to based on twelve month trailing ebitda 
the facility has no financial covenants unless availability under the facility is less than million 
the terms of our credit facility limit the payment of dividends without the prior written consent of the lenders 
we believe that the current level of cash and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our immediate capital needs 
from time to time  acquisition opportunities are reviewed relating to our business 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition and the associated capital commitments are unpredictable 
should further opportunities for growth requiring capital arise  we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital  cash generated from operations  and either debt or equity financing 
however  there can be no assurance that such capital would be available 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and the following tables summarize our operations for the twelve months ended december  and year ended december  contract drilling change dollars in s revenues   drilling cost   selling  general and administrative   depreciation and amortization   operating income   rig utilization rate average number of rigs owned operating days   average revenue per operating day average drilling cost per operating day the significant increases shown were reflective of increased activity in the contract drilling industry and specifically increases in average rig utilization and in the number of operating days  increases in dayrates as evidenced by average revenue per operating day  and the addition of an average drilling rigs from to largely due to favorable commodity prices during the first half of  the demand for our contract drilling services was strong as we reached our peak rig utilization of in july 
however  beginning in the third quarter of the industry conditions began to deteriorate as the commodity prices of oil and natural gas significantly weakened 
market prices for oil fell from approximately per barrel at the end of to approximately per barrel in late and natural gas prices declined from approximately per mcf to under per mcf for the same time period 
accordingly  the demand for our contract drilling services has been negatively impacted 
should commodity prices improve  we would expect to begin to see increases in demand 
year ended december  drilling and completion fluids change dollars in s revenues   drilling and completion fluids cost   selling  general and administrative   depreciation and amortization   operating income loss   total jobs  average revenue per job the increases above were primarily attributable to the purchase of the fluids division of ambar  inc  during october providing for twelve months of activity in versus three months in deteriorating industry conditions as noted above also had an adverse impact on our drilling and completion fluids division beginning in the third quarter of should industry conditions improve  we would expect to begin to see improvements in such operations 
year ended december  pressure pumping change dollars in s revenues   pressure pumping cost   selling  general and administrative   depreciation   operating income   total jobs   average revenue per job the improvement in the pressure pumping segment s operating results were primarily attributable to improved market conditions throughout as evidenced by the increase in number of jobs and revenue per job

this impairment is attributable to declining commodity prices and unfavorable results from certain oil and natural gas prospects 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of the increased activity as evidenced by the operating segments individual results of operations and the growth of our company in through acquisitions 
included in this increase are management and operational bonuses resulting from improved operations 
comparison of the years ended december  and the following tables summarize our operations for the twelve months ended december  and year ended december  contract drilling change dollars in s revenues   drilling cost   selling  general and administrative   depreciation and amortization   operating income loss   rig utilization rate average number of rigs owned operating days   average revenue per operating day average drilling cost per operating day the significant increases shown were reflective of increased activity in the contract drilling industry and specifically increases in average rig utilization and in the number of operating days  increases in dayrates as evidenced by average revenue per operating day  and the addition of an average drilling rigs from to year ended december  drilling and completion fluids change dollars in s revenues   drilling and completion fluids cost   selling  general and administrative   depreciation and amortization   operating income loss  total jobs average revenue per job the increases above were primarily attributable to the purchase of the fluids division of ambar  inc  during october providing for three months of activity in and favorable industry conditions during most of year ended december  pressure pumping change dollars in s revenues   pressure pumping cost   selling  general and administrative   depreciation   operating income   total jobs   average revenue per job year ended december  other and corporate change dollars in s revenues   other income expenses   selling  general and administrative   depreciation  depletion and amortization   bad debt expense operating loss   the increase in revenues in other and corporate is reflective of increased activity in our oil and natural gas operations resulting from a rise in the average price received for crude oil from per bbl to per bbl and a rise in the average price received for natural gas from per mcf to per mcf from to  respectively 
income taxes year ended december  dollars in s total income tax provision benefit    effective tax rate we recognized income tax benefit of million for  resulting from losses from operations 
we recognized income tax expense of million for  even though a minimal current expense existed due to loss carryforwards from prior years 
our remaining unutilized investment tax credit carryforward expired in net operating losses were fully utilized in and the remaining alternative minimum tax credit may be carried forward indefinitely 
deferred tax assets at december   consist primarily of various allowance accounts and tax deferred expenses expected to generate a future tax benefit of approximately million 
we record non cash federal deferred income taxes based primarily on the relationship between the amount of our unused federal nol carryforwards and the temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis in our assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
as a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes  we will incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized 
we incurred deferred income tax expense of approximately million and million for and  respectively  and a deferred income tax benefit of approximately million for volatility of oil and natural gas prices our revenue  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  with respect to all of our operating segments 
historically  oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile 
prices are affected by market supply and demand factors as well as actions of state and local agencies  the united states and foreign governments and international cartels 
all of these are beyond our control 
any significant or extended decline in oil and or natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
due to a decline in oil and natural gas prices beginning in the second quarter of  demand for drilling rigs declined beginning in the third quarter of and is continuing 
this decline in demand has resulted in a steep decline in drilling rig utilization and day rates  which in turn has adversely impacted our operations 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation will not have a significant near term impact on our financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently have no exposure to interest rate market risk as we have no outstanding balance under our credit facility 
should we incur a balance in the future  we would have some exposure associated with the floating rate of the interest charged on that balance 
the credit facility  which expires on june   bears interest at libor plus to based on the company s twelve month trailing ebitda 
our exposure to interest rate risk due to changes in libor is not expected to be material 
we conduct some business in canadian dollars through our canadian land based drilling operations 
the exchange rate between canadian dollars and us dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years 
if the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar weakens  revenues and earnings of our canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our canadian net assets in us dollars may decline
