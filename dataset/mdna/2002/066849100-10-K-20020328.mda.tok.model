non residential mortgage consumer losses are recognized no later than the point at which a loan is days past due 
residential mortgage losses are recognized during the foreclosure process when that loss is quantifiable and reasonably assured 
for commercial loans the bank applies a risk grading system 
this system stratifies the portfolio and allows management to focus its efforts on the highest risk components of the portfolio 
the risk grades include ratings that correlate with regulatory definitions of pass  other assets especially mentioned  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
loan loss provisions are recorded and the allowance is increased when loss is identified and deemed likely 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of the borrowers may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance  which also may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance  based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank s principal regulatory agency  the fdic  conducted an examination during the second quarter of in connection with its review  the bank agreed to increase the provision  implement a classified asset reduction plan  revise its credit administration plan  and implement certain revisions to its asset appraisal procedures 
the foregoing actions  in management s judgment  have been satisfactorily completed 
the following table  summary of loan loss experience  includes an analysis of the changes to the allowance for possible loan loss for the past five years 
summary of loan loss experience balance at beginning of period charge offs commercial  financial  agricultural  others real estate mortgages installments and other loans to individuals total charge offs recoveries commercial  financial  agricultural  others real estate mortgages installments and other loans to individuals total recoveries net charge offs provision charged to operations balance at end of period average loans outstanding during period net charge offs to average loans outstanding during period net loans charged off in were  or of average loans during the period 
this represents an increase of  over the prior year when net charge offs totaled  or of average loans 
recoveries in on loans previously charged off were as compared with in the increase in loan charge offs includes one large credit exceeding  that was charged off in the second quarter 
increased installment loan charge offs in over those in are principally attributed to losses on two relationships 
the provision for loan losses provision in was  or of total average loans 
in  the provision was  or of average loans while in the provision was  or of average loans 
the strengthening of the company s credit administration function and the tightening of credit underwriting standards in general resulted in the identification of risk and probable losses associated with certain loans in the portfolio 
portfolio characteristics and declining economic conditions also contributed to the increased provision in no portion of the allowance is restricted to any loan or group of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb realized losses 
the amount and timing of realized losses and future allowance allocations may vary from current estimates 
the following table presents the breakdown of the allowance by loan type at december      and allocation of allowance for possible loan losses at december amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate mortgages installments and other loans to individuals other unallocated total at december   the adequacy analysis resulted in a need for specific reserves of  general reserves of  impaired reserves of  and other reserves of specific reserves are determined by way of individual review of commercial loan relationships in excess of  combined with reserves calculated against total outstandings by category using the company s historical loss experience and other observable data 
general reserves account for the risk and probable loss inherent in certain pools of industry and geographic concentration within the loan portfolio 
loan concentrations continue to reflect the company s business region 
the loan portfolio includes  of loans to the hospitality industry  or of total loans  compared with  or  at december  there were no major changes in loan concentrations in and no significant changes to the allowance for possible loan losses were made in this particular regard 
management reviews impaired loans to insure such loans are transferred to nonaccrual and written down when necessary 
the review includes specific reviews of commercial relationships over smaller homogeneous loans are not individually reviewed  but are reserved collectively 
impaired reserves consider all consumer loans that are over days past due and impaired commercial loans which are fully reserved within the specific reserves via individual review and specific allocation of potential loss for loans relationships over  and pool reserves for smaller impaired loans 
the bank had no troubled debt restructurings at december   and all of its impaired loans were considered collateral dependent and were adequately reserved 
total reserves against impaired loans were at december  loan delinquency levels have remained at low levels for several consecutive months 
however  existing loan documentation and or structural weaknesses for certain loans written in prior years continue to impede collection efforts in certain cases and have impacted probable losses 
these weaknesses are historical in nature and do not necessarily reflect current loan underwriting and documentation standards 
the extent of these problems in the entire loan portfolio is not entirely known  however  it is known that such problems exist and  accordingly  the allowance for loan losses incorporates this knowledge 
the bank s allowance for loan losses declined slightly from december   however  the allowance at december   represents a higher percentage of delinquent and non performing loans than in the preceding year 
management believes that the allowance at december   is appropriate for the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  and resident in the local and national economy as of that date 
market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do no arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the responsibility for balance sheet risk management oversight is the function of the bank s asset liability committee alco  chaired by the chief financial officer and composed of various members of corporate senior management 
alco meets regularly to review balance sheet structure  formulate strategy in light of current and expected economic conditions  adjust product prices as necessary  implement policy  monitor liquidity  and review performance against guidelines established to control exposure to the various types of inherent risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as an exposure to movement in interest rates that could have an adverse impact on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk arises naturally from the imbalance in the re pricing  maturity and or cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities 
management s objectives are to measure  monitor and develop strategies in response to the interest rate risk profile inherent in the bank s balance sheet 
the bank s interest rate risk measurement and management techniques incorporate the re pricing and cash flow attributes of balance sheet and off balance sheet instruments as they relate to current and potential changes in interest rates 
the level of interest rate risk  measured in terms of the potential future effect on net interest income  is determined through the use of modeling and other techniques under multiple interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk is evaluated in depth on a quarterly basis and reviewed by alco and the board of directors 
the bank s asset liability management policy  approved annually by the board of directors  establishes interest rate risk limits in terms of variability of net interest income under rising  flat and decreasing rate scenarios 
it is the role of alco to evaluate the overall risk profile and to determine actions to maintain and achieve a posture consistent with policy guidelines 
the bank utilizes an interest rate risk model widely recognized in the financial industry to monitor and measure interest rate risk 
the model simulates the behavior of interest income and expense of all on and off balance sheet instruments under different interest rate scenarios together with a dynamic future balance sheet 
interest rate risk is measured in terms of potential changes in net interest income based upon shifts in the yield curve 
the model requires that assets and liabilities be broken down into components as to fixed  variable  and adjustable interest rates as well as other homogeneous groupings  which are segregated as to maturity and type of instrument 
cash flows and maturities are then determined and  for certain assets  prepayment assumptions are estimated under different rate scenarios 
re pricing margins are also determined for adjustable rate assets 
interest income and interest expense are then simulated under several rate conditions including a flat interest rate scenario in which today s prevailing rates are locked in and the only balance sheet fluctuations that occur are due to cash flows  maturities  new volumes  and re pricing volumes consistent with this flat rate assumption 
a  and basis point rise or decline in interest rates applied against a parallel shift in the yield curve over a twelve month period together with a dynamic balance sheet anticipated to be consistent with such interest rate changes 
an extension of the foregoing simulation to each of two  three  four and five year horizons to determine the interest rate risk with the level of interest rates stabilizing in years two through five 
even though rates remain stable during this two to five year time period  the balance sheet has growth similar to the first twelve months modeled for each of the rate conditions  as well as re pricing opportunities driven by maturities  cash flow  and adjustable rate products which will continue to change the balance sheet profile for each of the rate conditions 
changes in net interest income based upon the foregoing simulations are measured against the flat interest rate scenario and actions are taken to maintain the balance sheet interest rate risk within established policy guidelines 
in addition to the parallel simulation  interest rate risk is regularly measured under various non parallel yield curve shifts  pricing  and balance sheet assumptions 
the following table summarizes the bank s net interest income sensitivity analysis as of december  and  utilizing a basis point change in interest rates over one and two year horizons  with a basis point change presented as of the current period 
interest rate risk change in net interest income from the flat rate scenerio december  basis points basis points basis points year net interest income change net interest income change year net interest income change net interest income change interest rate risk change in net interest income from the flat rate scenerio december  basis points basis points year net interest income change net interest income change year net interest income change net interest income change the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels and yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results may also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels deviating from those assumed  the impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals  and product preference changes  and other such variables 
the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
when appropriate  alco may use off balance sheet instruments such as interest rate floors  caps and swaps to hedge its interest rate risk position 
a policy statement  approved by the board of directors of the bank  governs use of these instruments 
during and  there were no off balance sheet instruments in place 
liquidity risk liquidity is measured by the company s ability to meet short term cash needs at a reasonable cost or minimal loss 
the company seeks to obtain favorable sources of liabilities and to maintain prudent levels of liquid assets in order to satisfy varied liquidity demands 
besides serving as a funding source for maturing obligations  liquidity provides flexibility in responding to customer initiated needs 
many factors affect the company s ability to meet liquidity needs  including variations in the markets served by its network of offices  its mix of assets and liabilities  reputation and credit standing in the marketplace  and general economic conditions 
the company actively manages its liquidity position through target ratios established under it asset liability management policy 
continual monitoring of these ratios  both historical and through forecasts under multiple rate scenarios  allows the company to employ strategies necessary to maintain adequate liquidity 
the company uses a basic surplus deficit model to measure its liquidity over and day time horizons 
the relationship between liquid assets and short term liabilities that are vulnerable to non replacement are routinely monitored 
the company s policy is to maintain its liquidity position at a minimum of of total assets 
at december   liquidity  as measured by the basic surplus deficit model  was for the day horizon 
including the company s unused line of credit at the federal home loan bank  basic surplus stood at 
off balance sheet risk commitments to extend credit the company makes contractual commitments to extend credit and extends lines of credit  which are subject to the company s credit approval and monitoring procedures 
as more fully described in note to the financial statements  at december  and  commitments to extend credit in the form of loans  including unused lines of credit and commitments to originate loans  amounted to  and  respectively 
increases in the unused lines of credit on home equity loans  combined with commercial lines of credit at year end  are responsible for the  increase in unused lines and commitments compared with in the opinion of management  there are no material commitments to extend credit that represent unusual risks 
letters of credit and stand by letters of credit the bank guarantees the obligations or performance of customers by issuing letters of credit and standby letters of credit to third parties 
these letters of credit are sometimes issued in support of third party debt 
the risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to customers  and they are subject to the same origination  portfolio maintenance and management procedures in effect to monitor other credit and off balance sheet products 
at december  and  outstanding letters of credit and standby letters of credit totaled  and  respectively 
counter party risk pursuant to its asset liability management policy  the bank may enter into interest rate swap and floor agreements under which the bank and the swap or floor counter party would be obligated to exchange interest payments on notional principal amounts 
for swap and floor transactions  the contract or notional amount does not represent exposure to credit loss 
the bank would be exposed to risk should the counter party default in its responsibility to pay interest under the terms of the swap or floor agreement 
the bank controls counter party risk through credit approvals  limits  and monitoring procedures 
during and  there were no interest rate swaps or floor agreements in place 
regulatory matters in the third quarter of  the bank entered into an agreement agreement with its principal regulators  the fdic and the bfi 
pursuant to that agreement  the bank has increased its allowance for loan losses  developed a classified asset reduction plan for certain commercial relationships  revised its credit administration plan  implemented certain revisions in its asset appraisal procedures  established a minimum capital threshold of or above the regulatory minimum of for well capitalized banks  improved certain account reconciliation procedures  addressed certain weaknesses in its information systems  improved its procedures to ensure its compliance with the bank secrecy act  and initiated a long term strategic planning process which is currently underway 
the bank has also implemented a policy of paying dividends to its parent  the company  only from current earnings  exclusive of gains on the sale of securities  without prior approval of its principal regulators 
the bank is providing updates covering the status of the foregoing items to its principal regulators on a quarterly basis 
in management s judgment  the bank is adequately addressing the matters set forth in the agreement 
recently issued accounting standards the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill reflected on the company s balance sheet be no longer amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment 
the amortization of goodwill ceases upon adoption of the statement 
the company will adopt sfas no 
effective january  at december   the company had of goodwill stated under other assets on its balance sheet  related to the acquisition of dirigo investments  inc  in january in connection with the preparation of the financial statements  management has evaluated the impact of adopting sfas no 
and considered the potential effects of timing  application  and results of the new goodwill impairment testing methodology 
while the company has determined that goodwill is fairly stated at december   it has not determined the impact  if any  of adopting sfas no 
on january
