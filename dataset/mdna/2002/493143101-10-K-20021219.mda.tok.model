item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries design  manufacture and sell process automation systems  integrating electro optical inspection  sorting and process systems 
the company consists of key technology  inc which directly owns four subsidiaries key technology fsc  inc  a foreign sales corporation fsc  key holdings usa llc  key technology australia pty 
ltd  and key technology amvc llc inactive 
key holdings usa llc owns suplusco holdings bv  its european subsidiary  which owns key technology bv key technology amvc llc owns applied laser system  inc inactive 
the company manufactures products in walla walla  washington  redmond  oregon  and beusichem  the netherlands 
the company acquired farmco and amvc on june  and july   respectively 
the operations of the acquired entities have been integrated into the operations of the company and are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates 
these acquisitions account for a large portion of the fluctuation in income and expense items between fiscal years  and application of critical accounting policies the company has identified its critical accounting policies  the application of which may materially affect the financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require management judgment to make estimates and assumptions in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories long lived assets and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
reserves for warranties accounting for income taxes 
table of contents management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors  and the audit committee has discussed the related disclosures in the md a section 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
additionally  the company sells its goods on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point  port of loading or port of discharge  depending on the final destination of the goods 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs either upon shipment by the company or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale 
revenue earned from services is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  the company defers revenue recognition 
in the event of revenue deferral  the sale value is not recorded as revenue to the company  accounts receivable are reduced by any amounts owed by the customer  and the cost of the goods or services deferred is carried in inventory 
the company believes that revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate because the company s terms of sale vary significantly  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
during fiscal  some customers were more aggressive in requiring additional contractual commitments from the company before final acceptance of equipment and associated transfer of title could occur  which has resulted in additional deferrals of revenue recognition 
increased customer contractual obligations may affect revenue recognition on an increased  yet indeterminate  amount of shipments in future periods 
at september   the company had deferred million of revenue compared to million for the year ended september  allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  doubtful accounts based on credit profiles of customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and customers historical payment patterns 
factors that affect collectibility of receivables include customer satisfaction and general economic or political factors in certain countries that affect the ability of customers to meet current obligations 
the company actively manages its credit risk by utilizing an independent credit rating and reporting service  by requiring certain percentages of down payment and progress payments on significant customer projects and by requiring secured forms of payment for customers with uncertain credit profiles or locations in certain countries 
forms of secured payment could include irrevocable letters of credit  bank guarantees  third party leasing arrangements or ex im bank guarantees  each utilizing uniform commercial code filings  or the like  with governmental entities where possible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management judgment in making assumptions relative to customer or general economic factors that are outside the company s control 
as of september  the balance sheet included allowances for doubtful accounts of  actual charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
if the company experiences actual bad debt expense in excess of estimates  or if estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  the carrying value of accounts receivable would decrease and charges for bad debts would increase  resulting in decreased net profits 

table of contents valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s inventory includes purchased raw materials  manufactured components  purchased components  work in process  finished goods and demonstration equipment 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories are made after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are the company s purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles and the associated product support 
the company actively manages its exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining low safety stocks and minimum purchase lots  utilizing just in time purchasing practices  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing such inventory minimization strategies as vendor managed inventories 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing to sales to production to after sale support 
at september   cumulative inventory adjustments to lower of cost or market totaled million compared to million for the year ended september  if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs  a decrease to gross margins and may adversely affect the borrowing base available under the company s credit facilities 
long lived assets and sfas no 
the company regularly reviews all of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the total of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of assets  an impairment loss  if any  based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets  is recorded 
as of september   the company held million of property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets  net of depreciation and amortization 
estimates of future cash flows arising from the utilization of these long lived assets and estimated useful lives associated with the assets are critical to the assessment of fair values 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generated throughout the lives of several product lines over extended periods of time  and the potential effect that recognizing an impairment could have on the assets reported on the company s balance sheet and the potential material adverse effect on the reported earnings or loss 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value  a charge to income from continuing operations and a reduction to net profit in the affected period  and may affect the company s ability to meet the tangible net worth covenant of it credit facilities 
the company elected to adopt sfas no 
prior to its filing of its first quarter financial statements on form q for the quarter ending december  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill  and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
as a result of the implementation of this change in accounting principle  the company recorded an impairment of goodwill associated with the automated inspection systems reporting unit  effective at the beginning of the fiscal year  of million  and related income tax benefits of  the company determined there was no impairment to the million of goodwill associated with the process systems reporting unit 
the impairment of goodwill was reported as a change in accounting principle  which is reported separately from the results of continuing operations  and included separate earnings per share disclosures 
any impairment of intangible assets subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
would be reported as a charge to income from continuing operations and a reduction in net profit in the affected period 

table of contents reserves for warranties 
the company s products are covered by warranty plans that extend between days and years  depending upon the product and contractual terms of sale 
the company establishes allowances for warranties for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  warranty claims based on contractual terms  product conditions and actual warranty experience by product line 
company products include both manufactured and purchased components  and therefore warranty plans include third party sourced parts which may not be covered by the third party manufacturer s warranty 
ultimately  the warranty experience of the company is directly attributable to the quality of its products 
the company actively manages its quality program by using a structured product introduction plan  process monitoring techniques utilizing statistical process controls  vendor quality metrics  a quality training curriculum for every employee and feedback loops to communicate warranty claims to designers and engineers for remediation in future production 
warranty expense has varied widely in the past due to such factors as significant new product introductions containing latent defects and design errors on individual large projects 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to reserves for warranties is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to significant fluctuation period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future warranty claims relative to potential unknown issues arising in both existing and new products  which assumptions are derived from historical trends of known or resolved issues  and risks associated with third party supplied components being manufactured using processes that the company does not control 
as of september   the balance sheet included warranty reserves of  while million of warranty charges were incurred during the fiscal year then ended  compared to warranty reserves of  and warranty charges of million for the year ended september  if the company s actual warranty costs are higher than estimates  warranty plan coverages are adversely varied  or estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  reserves for warranty would decrease  warranty expense would increase and gross margins would decrease 
accounting for income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the quarterly provision for income taxes is based partially upon estimates of pre tax financial accounting income for the full year and is affected by various differences between financial accounting income and taxable income 
judgment is also applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
in management s judgment  when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
there was no valuation allowance at september   due to anticipated utilization of all tax deferred tax assets 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because it relies on significant management judgment in making assumptions relative to temporary and permanent timing differences of tax effects  estimates of future earnings  prospective application of changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions  and the resulting ability to utilize tax assets at those future dates 
if the company s operating results were to fall short of expectations  thereby affecting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of the valuation allowance required to be included in the financial statements established in any given period 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance would reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  increase tax expense and reduce net income 

table of contents results of operations for the fiscal years ended september   and  the company s net sales were million  million  and million  respectively 
sales of parts and service contracts increased by  which was more than offset by decreases in sales of automated inspection systems and process systems of and  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal the company did not experience any significant turn key sales in fiscal or as compared to fiscal where turn key sales were approximately million 
net sales in fiscal increased by compared to fiscal sales of automated inspection systems  process systems and parts and service contracts increased by   and  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  the company experienced the benefits of the acquisitions of farmco and amvc made in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  as the incremental net sales from acquisitions accounted for the revenue growth in all product categories in fiscal acquired product lines  exclusive of parts and service  contributed approximately and of the systems sold in fiscal and  respectively 
the acquisition of amvc also helped accelerate the company s strategy of diversification  as net sales of non food systems  principally to the tobacco industry  represented and of system sales in fiscal and  respectively 
parts and service contract net sales increased by in fiscal over fiscal as a result of the acquisitions of farmco and amvc made in fiscal the incremental net sales from acquired product lines were partially offset by decreased net sales from the company s traditional business the food processing industry in the united states during both fiscal and fiscal the soft markets experienced in fiscal continued through much of fiscal as sales to the food processing industry continued to be unfavorably affected by market factors including further consolidation among food processors  which resulted in delayed investments in capital equipment by the company s customers 
softness in the vegetable industry caused by processed inventories carried over from the previous season and lower prices for customers products 
the continuing relatively high energy costs in certain sectors of the company s markets which contributed to cost pressures and reduced spending by customers for both new equipment and maintenance expenditures for parts and service 
the strength of the us dollar in world markets  which has made us manufactured goods relatively more expensive to international customers 
these factors began to reverse during the fourth quarter of fiscal reduction of interest rates both during and subsequent to the end of fiscal  easing of energy costs  weakening of the us dollar on world markets and improved health of customers in the vegetable industry have begun to show some favorable effects as new orders have increased subsequent to the close of fiscal there can be no assurance that these recent market changes will be sustainable 
export and international sales accounted for  and of total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
international sales decreased in fiscal to a proportion of total sales similar to previous years as a result of a non recurrence of a large french fry project in europe during fiscal european customers represented the largest market for such international sales in each of the three fiscal years 

table of contents gross profit was  and of sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the gross margin  as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  benefited from improvements in efficiencies across most product lines  including improvements in utilization of production and service capacity  and cost cutting measures taken during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal automated inspection systems gross margins  as a percent of net sales  increased by seven percentage points in fiscal over fiscal  principally as the result of a decrease in other costs of sale  largely due to improved utilization of manufacturing facilities  with a lesser contribution coming from decreased warranty costs 
the gross margins for process systems between fiscal and fiscal were comparable  with improvements in manufacturing efficiencies offset by increases in warranty expenses  due principally to two french fry projects in europe 
the company does not anticipate the recurrence of warranty costs due to similar causes as those experienced on these two projects 
parts and service contracts gross margins  as a percent of net sales  increased by eight percentage points in fiscal from fiscal  principally as the result of improved utilization of field service personnel 
the gross margin  as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  suffered from decreased margins in automated inspection systems and in parts and service contracts  partially offset by increased margins in process systems 
automated inspection systems gross margins  as a percent of net sales  decreased by four percentage points in fiscal from fiscal  principally as the result of a increase in warranty costs  the underutilization of manufacturing facilities and the accounting treatment of acquired inventories 
parts and service contracts gross margins  as a percent of net sales  decreased by eight percentage points in fiscal from fiscal  principally as the result of underutilization of field service personnel due to customer cutbacks in maintenance spending  and the costs associated with cross training of service personnel on all product lines 
the gross margins for process systems improved principally as a result of better cost control  and because the company did not experience any lower margin turn key sales in fiscal as compared to million of turn key sales in fiscal operating expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively 
during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  the company implemented significant cost reduction programs  which resulted in reduced operating expenses in all areas for fiscal when compared to the prior fiscal year 
a small portion of the expense decrease during fiscal  approximately of sales  was the result of the company s implementation of sfas  resulting in reduced amortization expense 
operating expenses in fiscal include a full year of operating expenses and amortization of intangibles of acquired companies  while fiscal included such expenses for approximately one quarter 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively 
in fiscal  selling and marketing expenses decreased principally due to reductions in programs and the associated manpower 
at the same time  the company invested in improved sales coverage in the asia pacific area with the opening of its new office in australia 
in fiscal  selling and marketing expenses increased over fiscal  principally due to the expenses contributed by the acquisitions 
during fiscal  the company also increased investment in new product promotions related to four new products introduced in fiscal and expanded sales coverage to new european and latin american markets 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively 
activities in fiscal focused on extending the capabilities and applications of the technologies contained in optyx  tegra and prism  and development of new inspection technologies 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased by approximately compared to the reduced levels of research and development expenses experienced in fiscal were the result of the full integration of the research and development activities of the acquired companies 

table of contents general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was an increase from million in fiscal  and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of elimination of nonrecurring and redundant costs experienced in fiscal as the company integrated the acquisitions made in fiscal these cost savings were partially offset by increased accounting and legal costs incurred during fiscal with regard to the sfas implementation and work on alternatives to meet the potential preferred stock redemption obligation 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal by approximately compared to fiscal as a result of a full year of combined operations in fiscal as compared to only a partial year in fiscal the decrease in amortization of intangibles  representing of net sales  for fiscal when compared to fiscal is the result of implementation of sfas  which eliminated amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets 
fiscal included a full year of amortization of acquired intangibles as compared to only a partial year in fiscal the company obtained independent appraisals of the fair market value of the amvc intangible assets acquired 
acquired intangible assets  including patents  existing technologies  trademarks  trade names and purchased customer development  are amortized over the shorter of their remaining lives or periods of to years 
a one time charge of  associated with the write off of acquired in process research and development was recorded immediately subsequent to the acquisition of amvc in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company anticipates increases in its insurance rates for both the employee benefit coverage and the risk management packages as a result of independent market factors 
losses incurred by carriers as a result of terrorist attacks and the well publicized cases of corporate malfeasance  together with general increases in health coverages  may result in increases  with estimates ranging from to or even more 
while the company has not received formal quotes in relation to any prospective renewals  market indicators point toward possible increases that may increase general and administrative expenses by as much as  to  during fiscal other income and expense includes interest income and expense  royalty income and other income or expense from miscellaneous sources 
net interest expense in fiscal was  compared to million in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in net interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from decreases in interest rates  both as a result of reductions in prime rate and reduced rates on refinanced debt  and decreases in total debt as a result of the company s strategy of applying cash generated from operating activities to debt reduction 
the increase in net interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from increased interest expense on long term debt arising from the acquisitions in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal and lower interest earnings as a result of lower invested cash and cash equivalents  and short term investment balances 
during fiscal  as part of the company s efforts to establish alternatives to meet the potential obligation arising from the redemption of preferred stock  the company embarked upon a tender offer to holders of that stock 
with the success of the refinance of the company s credit facilities  which provided funds for redemption  the tender offer was discontinued and  of associated costs were charged to other expense 
the company also recognized loan amortization costs of  for fiscal while fiscal and had no such costs 
during fiscal  the company received royalty payments of  compared to total royalty income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal as part of a settlement agreement entered into during  the company received royalty payments through fiscal related to the sale of certain equipment to a selected market 
the company recognized royalty income from this agreement of  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  the company recognized foreign currency transaction gains totaling  on cash and accounts receivable held primarily in euros and dutch guilders 
this compares to foreign currency transaction gains of  and foreign currency transaction losses of  in fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents the company s effective income tax rate was a tax expense of in fiscal  compared to tax benefits of and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective tax expense or tax benefit rate varies from the statutory rate of due to permanent differences in tax obligations arising from extra territorial income exclusions  research and development tax credits  and other permanent differences 
the larger variance from statutory rates in fiscal compared to fiscal and is principally due to the small taxable net loss reported for fiscal compared to larger taxable earnings or loss for the other fiscal years 
as a percentage of pre tax earnings or losses  the tax effect of permanent differences is lower in magnitude as pre tax earnings or losses move in either direction from zero 
on october   the company completed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary  ventek  inc  which supplied machine vision systems to the forest products industry 
ventek was acquired as part of the acquisition of amvc 
the company s strategic objective when it purchased amvc was to acquire src vision src  which the company believes yielded the expected synergies 
the company did not experience the same synergies with ventek  which served different markets 
ventek was also adversely affected by the slowdown in the forest products industry during fiscal and fiscal  resulting in a decreased financial contribution to the consolidated group 
the sale of ventek continued the efforts the company has taken in fiscal and to reduce costs and improve its financial results 
as a result of the sale of ventek  the company recorded a loss on the sale of discontinued operations of approximately million  net of tax  in fiscal the company also reported net earnings from this discontinued operation of  net of tax in fiscal  compared to net losses from the discontinued operation of  and  net of tax  for fiscal and  respectively 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of the sale of ventek 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company restructured its credit facility with its senior lender and  in the fourth fiscal quarter  refinanced its credit facility with a new senior lender 
each of these activities resulted in the expensing of unamortized loan origination fees as extraordinary items 
in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold its surplus manufacturing facility in medford  oregon  moved its medford staff into a smaller leased portion of that same facility and paid off the mortgage secured by that facility 
the early payoff of the mortgage resulted in a prepayment penalty and write off of associated unamortized loan costs  which was expensed as an extraordinary item 
the total charge for extraordinary items during fiscal was  net of tax  compared to no such charges in either fiscal or a recent accounting pronouncement which becomes effective in the fiscal will likely require that these charges be restated as part of net income from continuing operations  therefore  the company expects to reclassify these charges when it reports and compares the results of operations in fiscal to fiscal net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal and net earnings of  or net loss per diluted share of  for fiscal net earnings or loss for each period is adjusted by the accretion of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in calculating the associated earnings per share 
the increase in net income from continuing operations in fiscal was due to the cost cutting measures employed in late fiscal and early to reduce spending and return the company to profitability  and improvements in gross margins and operating expenses from the non recurrence of merger related and integration charges incurred in fiscal  which totaled million  or million after tax 
the increase in the net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted principally from decreased gross margins due to an increase in warranty costs  integration and overhead costs associated with the combination of the service and manufacturing organizations resulting from the amvc acquisition and the required accounting treatment of acquisition related inventories 

table of contents the company reported a net loss for fiscal of million  or per diluted share  after giving effect to earnings or losses from discontinued operations and the losses due to the extraordinary item and change in accounting principle 
this compares to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal and a net loss of  or per diluted share  in fiscal the reported basic and diluted earnings or loss per share for the respective periods are the same  due to the anti dilutive effect of the common share equivalents 
liquidity and capital resources the company successfully generated cash as a result of profitable continuing operations and asset management in fiscal the company strengthened its balance sheet and improved normal operating and balance sheet ratios by utilizing cash flows from operating and investing activities to reduce interest bearing debt and redeem preferred stock and warrants 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was favorably affected by non cash expenses reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings loss such as depreciation and amortization of million  the non cash charge for the change of accounting principle of million and non cash tax expense of million due to application of deferred income taxes resulting from the application of net operating loss and tax benefit carryovers from previous years  much of which was acquired with the amvc acquisition 
the company expects that these tax benefits and carryovers will be fully utilizable in reducing cash tax payments for fiscal and beyond 
in addition  cash provided by operating activities was affected by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventory of million  income tax refunds or other reductions to income tax receivables of million  increases in payroll  commissions and other liabilities netting million and an increase in customer deposits of million 
these cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  and a decrease in income taxes payable of million 
these changes in the balance sheet are a result of management s focus on cash generation through aggressive asset management  particularly in the fairly liquid areas such as accounts receivable  inventory and customer deposits 
cash generated from these sources provided funds to decrease accounts payable to more comfortable levels and reduce the interest bearing debt to provide borrowing capacity for redemption of preferred stock and warrants late in fiscal while management continues a strategic focus on cash generation through profitable operations and asset management  it does not expect to see the levels of cash inflows from asset management that were achieved in fiscal days sales in accounts receivable  a large source of cash inflows during fiscal  are as good as the company has been able to achieve at any point in its recent history 
management does expect to maintain gains accomplished in fiscal  while dedicating additional attention to inventory turns to improve the company s return on assets employed 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was also favorably affected by non cash expenses reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings loss such as depreciation and amortization of million and the non cash charge for loss on the operation and sale of the discontinued operation of million  partially offset by the non cash tax benefits which increased deferred income taxes by million 
these deferred tax benefits were added to existing carryovers of net operating losses and other tax benefits  which were available to reduce the cash tax requirement in future fiscal years 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was adversely affected by an increase in accounts receivable totaling million that resulted from slower payment patterns of certain european customers and the grant of extended 
table of contents payment terms to certain customers 
during fiscal  cash was generated by a decrease in accounts receivable totaling million that resulted principally from a decrease in sales volume and improved accounts receivable management 
operating activities during provided million in cash from a decrease in inventory compared to million provided by a decrease in inventories in fiscal increases in trade accounts payable  income taxes payable and a decrease in prepaid expenses  partially offset by decreases in accrued payroll liabilities  accrued customer support and warranty costs  other accrued liabilities and customer deposits provided cash of million during fiscal by comparison  decreases in trade accounts payable  accrued payroll liabilities  income taxes payable  other accrued liabilities  and increases in prepaid expenses  utilized cash totaling million during fiscal net cash resources from investing activities totaled million in fiscal  coming principally from the sale of the company s ventek subsidiary and its medford manufacturing facility 
this compares to the sale of property totaling  in fiscal  while fiscal had no such activities 
acquisitions of capital equipment totaled   and million during  and  respectively 
at september   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
in fiscal  the company used million of cash to acquire amvc and farmco during the third and fourth quarters 
there were no purchases or sales of short term investments in fiscal or fiscal  compared to net proceeds of million arising from the sale and purchase of short term investments in fiscal short term investments were sold in fiscal to finance a portion of the acquisition of amvc and farmco during that year 
the company s overall cash strategy since fiscal has been to utilize cash to reduce interest bearing debt rather than build large cash reserves 
financing activities were affected in fiscal by the refinance of the company s credit facilities  which resulted in million in new long term debt  payments on or retirements of long term debt totaling million  redemption of million of preferred stock and warrants and payment of a  prepayment penalty on the early extinguishment of debt upon the sale of the company s medford facility 
financing activities were affected in fiscal by cash generated from short term borrowings of million 
there were no short term borrowings in fiscal the company repaid long term debt during fiscal and totaling million and million  respectively 
cash flows from the issuance of long term debt totaled million for fiscal with no such issuances in fiscal proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the company s employee stock option and stock purchase plans during fiscal  and totaled   and  respectively

borrowings under the operating line were  at september  in january  the company refinanced its domestic credit accommodation 
the refinanced domestic credit accommodation was secured by all of the personal property of the company and contains covenants which require the maintenance of a debt service coverage ratio and limit capital expenditures 
as a result of this refinancing  a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of  less related income tax benefits of  was recorded as an extraordinary item 

table of contents on august   the company again refinanced its credit facility with a new credit facility provided by a new principal lender 
the new credit facility includes a credit accommodation totaling million in the united states consisting of a term loan of million  a revolving credit facility of up to the lesser of million or the available borrowing base  which is based on varying percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventories  and a million standby line of credit 
the revolving credit facility and the standby line of credit mature on july  the term loan requires quarterly payments of principal of  beginning november and matures on july  the standby line of credit reduces in amount of availability beginning november  by the greater of  or of net cash generated from operations for the previous fiscal quarter 
the refinanced term loan and operating line bear interest at the wall street journal prime rate plus per annum  which totaled at september   while the standby line of credit  should it be utilized  bears interest at the wall street journal prime rate plus at september  
the credit facility is secured by all of the us personal property  including patents and other intangibles of the company and its subsidiaries  and contains covenants  effective beginning august   which require the maintenance of a defined debt service ratio  a defined net worth balance and ratio  minimum working capital and current ratio  and minimum profitability

the credit facility bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus  which at september  totaled 
at september   the company had no borrowings under this facility except the existing term loan of approximately  the company made significant progress in addressing the liquidity and credit risks it faced in although its financial condition has improved significantly  the company still faces certain risks in these areas 
the company s new revolving credit facilities contain covenants which require certain levels of performance in operations and balance sheet ratios with which continuing compliance may be difficult if market conditions deteriorate 
an event of default could accelerate the due date of principal payments  prevent the company from borrowing under its credit facility or renewing its credit facility when it expires  or make it more difficult for the company to obtain replacement or additional financing in the future on terms favorable to the company 
the new facility is secured by substantially all the company s assets  thus limiting the company s alternatives in securing additional financing 
although the company does not anticipate any event of default  there can be no assurance the company will be in compliance with the borrowing agreement covenants in the future
