net sales and costs and related assets and liabilities are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the operations  thereby serving to reduce the company s exposure to exchange gains and losses

the currency translation adjustment component of shareholders equity had the effect of decreasing total equity by million at september  as compared to million at september  the fluctuation of the euro and the other relevant functional currencies against the us dollar has had the effect of increasing or decreasing as applicable reported net sales  as well as cost of goods sold and gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses  denominated in such foreign currencies when translated into us dollars as compared to prior periods
