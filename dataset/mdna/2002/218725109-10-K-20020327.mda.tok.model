overview we license software and provide professional services to financial service providers  such as banks  brokerages  insurance companies and financial portals 
corillian voyager is a software platform combined with a set of applications for internet banking  electronic bill presentment and payment  targeted marketing  data aggregation and online customer relationship management 
our corillian voyager standard edition se is a hosted internet banking solution tailored to the specific needs of small to mid sized financial institutions looking for the same scalability and reliability of corillian voyager in a more rapidly deployable  economical solution 
the corillian voyager se services include internet banking  bill payment and the complete integration of the open financial exchange ofx data standard 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from licensing our software and performing professional services for our customers  both through direct sales channels and indirect sales partners 
these professional services include implementation  custom software engineering  consulting  maintenance  training and hosting 
in most cases  we recognize revenues for licenses  implementation and custom engineering services using the percentage of completion method 
revenue relating to maintenance services is recognized ratably over the term of the associated maintenance contract 
revenues derived from training  hosting and consulting services are recognized as the services are performed 
we generally license corillian voyager on an end user basis  with our initial license fee based on a fixed number of end users 
as a customer increases its installed base of end users beyond the initial fixed number of end users  our software license requires the customer to pay us an additional license fee to cover additional increments of end users 
for customers that provide us with significant strategic advantages  we have in the past and may in the future charge discounted license fees based on an unlimited number of end users 
cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for professional service personnel and outsourced professional service providers who are responsible for the implementation and customization of our software and for maintenance and support personnel who are responsible for software maintenance 
our cost of revenues also includes a royalty and purchases of equipment and materials 
in connection with the purchase of the voyager technology in  we agreed to pay a royalty of of our revenues  up to a maximum of million  which we fully recognized and paid as of december  from time to time to accommodate specific customers  we resell equipment and materials to these customers  and the expenses associated with the purchase of this equipment and materials is included within the cost of revenues in the year in which the resale occurs 
since incorporation  we have incurred substantial costs to develop and market our technology and to provide professional services 
as a result  we have incurred net losses in each quarter of operation since inception and have accumulated a deficit of million as of december  our limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast future operating results 
as a result of the rapid evolution of our business and our limited operating history  we believe period to period comparisons of our results of operations  including our revenues and costs of revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of sales  are not necessarily indicative of our future performance 

table of contents customers who individually accounted for more than of our revenue on a consolidated basis represented  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
acquisitions in november  we acquired hatcher associates inc hatcher  a software integration  implementation and consulting company focused on applications for consumer banking 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreement dated november   between hatcher and corillian  approximately million shares of corillian common stock were issued or reserved for issuance for all outstanding shares of hatcher 
corillian also assumed outstanding options for  shares of the common stock of hatcher  which converted into fully vested options for  shares of corillian common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the net assets and results of operations of hatcher have been included in corillian s consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
of the total purchase price of million  approximately million was allocated to tangible assets acquired  offset by approximately million of liabilities assumed  and the remainder was allocated to intangible assets  including customer relationships of million  workforce of million and goodwill of million 
the estimate of fair value of the net assets acquired was based on an independent appraisal and management estimates 
goodwill and customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years and workforce is amortized over its estimated useful life of two years 
during  corillian recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from this acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in april  corillian issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to acquire intertech systems  inc intertech  a minnesota corporation  which was a developer of data aggregation intellectual property and technology 
following the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  corillian recorded approximately million in research and development expenses during  consisting of million relating to the  shares issued to intertech and  for consulting and other services relating to the acquisition in connection with the intertech transaction 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires corillian to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  corillian evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
corillian bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include software revenue recognition  impairments and estimation of useful lives of long term assets  and accruals for loss contracts and contingencies 
our policy and related procedures for software revenue recognition are summarized below 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
corillian recognizes revenue from software licensing agreements in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
corillian s software licenses are functionally dependent on implementation and certain custom 
table of contents software engineering services  therefore  software licenses and implementation services  together with custom software engineering services that are essential to the functionality of the software  are combined and recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements  which generally include software licenses  implementation and custom software engineering services  post contractual customer support  training services and hosting services  is allocated to the elements using the residual method specified in sop no 
corillian has determined that post contractual customer support  training and hosting services can be separated from software licenses  implementation and custom software engineering services because a post contractual customer support  training and hosting services are not essential to the functionality of any other element in the arrangement  and b sufficient vendor specific objective evidence exists to permit the allocation of revenue to these service elements 
vendor specific objective evidence has been established on post contractual customer support and hosting services using the price the customer is required to pay when they are sold separately the renewal rate  and on training based on the price customers are charged when these services are sold separately 
under the residual method  the fair value of post contractual customer support  training  and hosting services is deferred and subsequently recognized as the services are performed  and the difference between the total software arrangement fee and the amount deferred for post contractual customer support  hosting and training services is allocated to software license  implementation and custom software engineering services and recognized using contract accounting 
the percentage of completion is measured by the percentage of contract hours incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract hours for each contract 
corillian has the ability to make reasonable  dependable estimates relating to the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
corillian reduces the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through corporate policy  approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as revenue in excess of billing or deferred revenue 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by certain lines in our consolidated statements of operations 
year ended december  revenue cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of deferred stock based compensation restructuring and impairment charges total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net net loss comparison of years ended december   and revenue revenues increased from million for  to million for  to million for the increase in revenues each year is primarily due to software license and professional services sales due to an increased number of new and existing customers  an increase in our average transaction size  an increase in the number of end users on our customers platforms and an increase in the number of our professional services personnel working on customer projects 
we believe that our customer growth has resulted from greater market acceptance of our solutions by banks and other financial institutions 
this increase is also due to increased revenues from our international operations and corillian services  inc our international operations generated approximately million of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  our international operations generated no revenue during the years ended december  and corillian services  inc contributed approximately million to our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  the operations of corillian services  inc  which we acquired on november   contributed approximately million to our consolidated revenue during the year ended december  we anticipate that the reduction in workforce we affected at corillian services  inc in the fourth quarter of will result in decreased revenues from corillian services  inc as a percentage of total revenue in subsequent fiscal years as compared to fiscal cost of revenue cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for professional service personnel and outsourced professional service providers who are responsible for the implementation and customization of our software and for maintenance and support personnel who are responsible for post contractual customer support 
cost of revenues increased from million for  to million for  to million for gross profit increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the increase from to was primarily due to our shift to time and materials pricing in early  the cessation of 
table of contents our royalty obligation to checkfree during the third quarter of and our improved utilization of professional services personnel implementing our products 
in connection with the purchase of the voyager technology in  we agreed to pay a royalty of seven percent of our revenue  up to a maximum of million 
corillian recorded   and in royalty expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we completed our requirements under the royalty agreement during and paid the entire royalty obligation as of december  gross profit increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in this increase in gross profit was primarily due to a reduction of third party integration expenses as we transitioned corillian services  inc personnel to our implementation projects  an increase in higher margin revenue sources such as additional seat license sales and new license sales to existing voyager customers  the cessation of our royalty obligation during and improved margins on professional services and post contractual customer support 
our acquisition of corillian services  inc in november resulted in a decrease throughout in the use of outsourced service providers to perform implementation and customization services on our projects 
we decreased the number of our professional services personnel from at december   to at december   as a result of our restructuring actions to improve operational efficiency during the fourth quarter of as part of these restructuring actions  we permanently transitioned corillian services  inc implementation personnel to corillian s internal implementation staff 
we expect to continue to rely on our internal staff  including remaining corillian services  inc personnel  to service our growing customer base 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions  and related expenses for personnel involved in marketing  sales and support functions  as well as costs associated with trade shows and other promotional activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million for  to million for  to million for sales and marketing expense increased from to primarily due to the expansion of our domestic sales and marketing organization  and to a lesser extent  increased sales commissions associated with higher revenues and higher expenses associated with increased brand awareness efforts 
this increase was also due to the expansion of our international sales and marketing infrastructure during in  we incurred direct sales and marketing expenses of million for our sales and marketing personnel based outside of the united states  as compared with no direct international sales and marketing expense during we increased the number of our sales and marketing personnel from at december   to at december  the increase in sales and marketing expense from to was primarily attributable to an increase of million and million  respectively  in direct international and corillian services  inc sales and marketing expenses 
during the years ended december  and  we incurred direct international sales and marketing expenses of million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  we incurred direct sales and marketing expenses of  and million  respectively  attributable to corillian services  inc this increase in sales and marketing expense from our international and corillian services  inc operations was partially offset by the effect of our reduction in workforce implemented in the fourth quarter of we decreased the number of our sales and marketing personnel from at december   to at december   mainly due to this reduction in workforce 
we expect sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars to decrease in the first two quarters of as a result of our reduction in workforce  as compared with comparable periods in although we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease in the near term  these expenses could fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of new marketing programs and the levels of revenues recognized in each period 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for engineering personnel and costs of materials and equipment associated with the 
table of contents design  development and testing of our products

research and development expense for the year ended december  also included million of research and development expense incurred during the second quarter of related to the acquisition of intertech systems  inc we increased the number of our research and development personnel from at december   to at december  research and development decreased from to primarily due to million of funded research and development  which was recorded as a reduction of research and development expense during the third quarter of we slightly decreased the number of our research and development personnel from at december   to at december  research and development expenses could fluctuate in future periods due to the additional funding of our research and development activities by portions of customer contracts accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 research and development arrangements  as well as internal funding for the development of new products and enhancements to existing products

during the years ended december  and  we incurred direct international general and administrative expenses of  and million  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  we incurred direct general and administrative expenses of  and million  respectively  attributable to corillian services  inc in the near term  we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease in absolute dollars as a result of the reduction in workforce implemented during the fourth quarter of amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was  and million in and  respectively  reflecting amortization of customer relationships  workforce and goodwill acquired as part of our acquisition of hatcher associates inc hatcher in november following the acquisition  corillian changed the name of hatcher to corillian services  inc during the fourth quarter of  corillian recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of corillian services  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million and million in connection with stock options granted during and  respectively 
this amount represents the difference between the exercise price of stock options granted to employees and the fair value of our common stock at the time of the grants 
in addition  this amount includes the fair value of stock options granted to non employees 
this amount is being amortized over the respective vesting periods of these options on an accelerated basis 
for the years ended december   and  amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  million and million  respectively 
we expect 
table of contents amortization of approximately   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively  related to these stock options 
restructuring and impairment charges 
during the fourth quarter of  corillian initiated restructuring actions to improve operational efficiency and reduce operating expenses 
charges related to these restructuring actions were accrued in the period in which executive management committed to execute such actions 
the restructuring actions taken in included the reorganization of operational and management responsibilities and closure of corillian services  inc s formerly hatcher associates inc los angeles headquarters 
these actions resulted in a net reduction of worldwide headcount of  of which were employees of corillian services  inc restructuring charges recorded in connection with these actions totaled million and consisted of severance related costs of million   in losses recognized on the sale of equipment  and lease cancellation costs of  the restructuring effort was substantially completed by december  of the cash restructuring charges of million  approximately  was paid in and the remainder will be paid during the first half of in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  management reviewed the goodwill and other intangible asset balances for impairment as corillian services  inc s operating results and forecasted future results indicated the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment analysis was based on projected undiscounted cash flows  which were no longer deemed adequate to support the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the business 
consequently  in the fourth quarter of  corillian determined that the goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired and corillian recorded an impairment of the entire goodwill and other intangible assets balance of approximately million 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  gains and losses recognized upon sale of our assets  interest expense  our share of earnings and losses in joint venture investments  and other miscellaneous items

this decrease was also attributable to increased interest expense incurred on corillian s capital lease and line of credit obligations throughout income taxes no provision for federal and state income taxes was recorded for  or because we had incurred net operating losses in each of those years 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that expire in various amounts beginning in we had net deferred tax assets  including our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  of million as of december  a valuation allowance has been recorded for the net deferred tax asset balance as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance

future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing of research and development efforts and the expansion of our operations  both domestically and internationally 
we believe our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
if additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms or at all 
additional financing could result in dilution to our current shareholders percentage ownership

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange rate sensitivity we develop products in the united states and market our products and services in the united states  and to a lesser extent in europe  asia and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
because nearly all of our revenue is currently denominated in united states dollars  a strengthening of the united states dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not engage in exchange rate hedging or hold or issue foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in europe  asia and australia and conduct transactions in various local currencies in these locales 
to date  the impact of fluctuations in the relative fair value of other currencies has not been material 
interest rate sensitivity at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million  which consist mainly of cash  highly liquid short term commercial paper and taxable municipal bonds 
our investments may be subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a decline in interest rates over a sustained period would reduce our interest income 
substantially all of our revenues recognized to date have been denominated in united states dollars and substantially all of our revenues are from customers in the united states 
although substantially all of our revenues have been from united states customers  we expect to recognize more significant revenues from international markets  and those revenues could be denominated in currency from those international markets 
as a result  our operating results could become 
table of contents subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of the international currencies in those markets in relation to the united states dollar and could be harmed
