allianceenterprise offers substantially broader and far superior capabilities over the company s predecessor product  dispatch  which was designed for only field service and customer support management applications 
the company s products and services are primarily used in industries such as information technology  healthcare  industrial controls and instrumentation  retail systems  office automation  imaging systems  facilities management and telecommunications 
an eclectic group of other industries  all with equipment sales and service requirements  are also represented in astea s customer base 
the company maintains offices in the united states  united kingdom  australia  israel and the netherlands

software license fees accounted for of the company s total revenues in sales of allianceenterprise accounted for of total revenues and add on sales to existing dispatch users accounted for of total revenues 
software license fee revenues also include some fees from the sublicensing of third party software  primarily relational database licenses 
typically  customers pay a license fee for the software based on the number of licensed users 
depending on the contract terms and conditions  software license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product if no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
if significant vendor obligations exist at the time of delivery or if the product is subject to uncertain customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until no significant obligations remain or acceptance has occurred 
the remaining component of the company s revenues consists principally of fees derived from professional services associated with the implementation and deployment of the company s software products and maintenance fees for ongoing customer support  primarily external customer technical support services and product enhancements 
professional services including training are charged on an hourly or daily basis and billed on a regular basis pursuant to customer work orders

the company recognizes revenue from professional services as the services are performed 
maintenance fees are typically paid to the company under agreements entered into at the time of the initial software license 
maintenance revenue  which is invoiced annually upon the expiration of the warranty period  is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which is usually twelve months 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of its financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of astea international inc are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statement of operations procedures 
the significant accounting policies that the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding its reported financial results include the following revenues in accordance with statement of operations procedures sop  provides guidelines on the recognition of software license fee revenue 
principally  revenue may be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the fee is probable 
the company allocates a portion of its software revenue to post contract support activities or to other services or products provided to the customer free of charge or at non standard discounts when provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement 
amounts allocated are based upon standard prices charged for those services or products 
software license fees for resellers or other members of the indirect sales channel are based on a fixed percentage of the company s standard prices 
the company recognizes software license revenue for such contracts based upon the terms and conditions provided by the reseller to its customer 
revenue from post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract on a straight line basis 
consulting and training service revenue is generally recognized at the time the service is performed 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment  provided that the contract has been executed  delivery of the software has occurred  fees are fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
in instances where the aforementioned criteria have not been met  both the license and the consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
in limited instances  the company will enter into contracts for which revenue is recognized under contract accounting 
the accounting for such arrangements requires judgement  which impacts the timing of revenue recognition and provision for estimated losses  if applicable 
capitalized software research and development costs our policy on capitalized software costs determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or cost of license fees 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization

the board of directors from time to time reviews the company s forecasted operations and financial condition to determine whether and when payment of a dividend or dividends is appropriate 
on june   the company paid a dividend of per share 
the company does not plan any significant capital expenditures in in addition  it does not anticipate that its operations or financial condition will be affected materially by inflation 
certain factors that may affect future results the company does not provide forecasts of its future financial performance 
from time to time  however  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical fact may constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the risks  uncertainties and other information discussed within this annual report on form k  as well as the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
the following discussion of the company s risk factors should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto set forth elsewhere in this report 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in forward looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this report and presented by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial conditions uncertain market acceptance of allianceenterprise  decreased revenues from dispatch in each of  and  more than   and  respectively  of the company s total revenues was derived from the licensing of dispatch and the provision of professional services in connection with the implementation  deployment and maintenance of dispatch installations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company originally introduced servicealliance in august in order to target a market segment in which dispatch was not cost effective or attractive 
subsequent  rapid changes in technology have now positioned the allianceenterprise suite  introduced in and which includes the allianceenterprise functionality  to supercede dispatch as the company s flagship product 
as a result  there are no sales planned or anticipated for dispatch to new customers 
sales to existing customers comprised of dispatch license revenue in and dispatch revenues have declined in each of the last three fiscal years and that trend is expected to continue and accelerate 
while the company has licensed allianceenterprise to over companies worldwide in through  revenues from sales of allianceenterprise alone are not yet sufficient to support the expenses of the company 
the company s future success will depend mainly on its ability to increase licenses of the allianceenterprise suite offerings  on developing new products and product enhancements to complement its existing product offerings  on its ability to continue support and maintenance revenues from dispatch  and on its ability to control its operating expenses 
any failure of the company s products to achieve or sustain market acceptance  or of the company to sustain its current position in the customer relationship management software market  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase demand for allianceenterprise  obtain an acceptable level of support and maintenance revenues from dispatch  or to lower its expenses  thereby avoiding future losses 
need for development of new products 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments  industry standards and the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers  including developments within the client server  thin client and object oriented computing environments 
such developments may require  from time to time  substantial capital investments by the company in product development and testing 
the company intends to continue its commitment to research and development and its efforts to develop new products and product enhancements 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products and product enhancements  that new products and product enhancements will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance  or that the company s current or future products will conform to industry requirements 
furthermore  reallocation of resources by the company  such as the diversion of research and development personnel to development of a particular feature for a potential or existing customer  can delay new products and certain product enhancements 
if the company is unable to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely effected 
competition in the customer relationship management software market is intense 
the crm software market is intensely competitive 
the company s competitors include large public companies such as oracle  peoplesoft and siebel  as well as traditional enterprise resource planning erp software providers such as sap that are developing crm capabilities 
in addition  a number of smaller  privately held companies generally focus only on discrete areas of the crm software marketplace 
because the barriers to entry in the crm software market are relatively low  new competitors may emerge with products that are superior to the company s products or that achieve greater market acceptance 
some of the company s existing and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than does the company 
moreover  the crm industry is currently experiencing significant consolidation  as larger public companies seek to enter the crm market through acquisitions 
the company expects that competition will increase as a result of software industry consolidations 
as a result  some of the company s competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development and distribution of their products 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not adversely affect its business and results of operations 
continued dependence on large contracts may result in lengthy sales and implementation cycles 
the sale and implementation of the company s products generally involve a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
while allianceenterprise requires a less substantial commitment than does dispatch  the purchase and implementation of allianceenterprise still requires a substantial commitment 
as a result  the company s sales process often is subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes attendant to significant capital expenditures  definition of special customer implementation requirements  and extensive contract negotiations with the customer 
the sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer and typically lasts between four and nine months 
during this time the company may devote significant time and resources to a prospective customer  including costs associated with multiple site visits  product demonstrations and feasibility studies 
the company may experience a number of significant delays over which the company has no control 
because the costs associated with the sale of the product are fixed in current periods  timing differences between incurring costs and recognition of revenue associated with a particular project may result 
moreover  in the event of any downturn in any existing or potential customer s business or the economy in general  purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled 
in addition  following the initial sale  the implementation of the company s products typically involves several months of integration of the product with the customer s other existing systems and customer training 
a successful implementation requires a close working relationship between the customer and members of the company s professional service organization 
occasionally  delays result from a customer s lack of attention to the implementation project for reasons unrelated to the company s performance 
when the company has provided consulting services to implement certain larger projects  some customers have in the past delayed payment of a portion of license fees until implementation was complete and in some cases have disputed the consulting fees charged for implementation 
there can be no assurance the company will not experience additional delays or disputes regarding payment in the future  particularly if the company receives orders for large  complex installations 
some of the company s customers have adopted the company s software on an incremental basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s customers will expand usage of the company s software on an enterprise wide basis or implement new software products introduced by the company 
the failure of the company s software to perform according to customer expectations or otherwise to be deployed on an enterprise wide basis could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to collect revenues or to increase revenues from new as well as existing customers 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results may be significant 
the company s quarterly operating results have in the past varied significantly and are likely to vary significantly in the future  depending on factors such as the size and timing of revenue from significant orders  the recognition of revenue from such orders  the timing of new product releases and market acceptance of these new releases  the level of product and price competition  and the seasonality of its business 
as a result of the application of the revenue recognition rules applicable to the company s licenses under generally accepted accounting principles  the company s license revenues may be recognized in periods after those in which the respective licenses were signed 
in addition  the company s quarterly operating results are dependent on factors such as budgeting cycles of its customers  customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products  the impact of acquisitions of competitors  the cancellation of licenses or maintenance agreements  product life cycles  software bugs and other product quality problems  personnel changes  changes in company strategy  investments to develop sales distribution channels  changes in the level of operating expenses and general domestic and international economic and political conditions  among others 
the company has generally had stronger demand for its products during the quarters ending in june and december and weaker demand in the quarter ending in march 
the company anticipates that it may also experience relatively weaker demand in the quarter ending in september 
moreover  the company has generally recorded most of its total quarterly license revenues in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last half of that third month 
this concentration of license revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter 
the company expects these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future 
thus  the company s results of operations may vary seasonally in accordance with licensing activity or otherwise  and will also depend upon its recognition of revenue from such licenses from time to time 
there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable or avoid losses in any future period  and the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
rapid technological change 
the crm software market is subject to rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving technologies and industry standards that can quickly render existing products and services obsolete 
while the company is not aware of any emerging products that are likely to render its existing products obsolete  there can be no assurance that the company s products could not suffer such obsolescence 
because of the rapid pace of technological change in the application software industry  the company s current market position could be eroded rapidly by product advancements 
the company s application environment relies primarily on software development tools from microsoft corporation and powersoft corporation  a subsidiary of sybase  inc  in the case of allianceenterprise  and progress software corporation  in the case of dispatch if alternative software development tools were to be designed and generally accepted by the marketplace  the company could be at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies employing such alternative developmental tools  possibly resulting in material harm to the company s financial condition and results of operation 
need to expand indirect sales 
the company has historically sold its products through its direct sales force and a limited number of distributors value added resellers  system integrators and sales agents 
the company s ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on its success in establishing relationships with distributors and oem partners 
the company is currently investing  and plans to continue to invest  significant resources to expand its domestic and international direct sales force and develop distribution relationships 
the company s distributors also sell or can potentially sell products offered by the company s competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of its existing or future third party distribution partners or that such partners will recommend  or continue to recommend  the company s products 
the inability to establish or maintain successful relationships with distributors and oem partners could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
any failure by the company to maintain and train its direct sales force and expand other distribution channels would materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with international sales 
astea s international sales accounted for of the company s revenues in  in  and in the company expects that international sales will continue to be a significant component of its business 
international sales are subject to a variety of significant risks  including difficulties in establishing and managing international distribution channels and in translating products into foreign languages 
international operations also may encounter difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  staffing and managing personnel and enforcing intellectual property rights 
other factors that can also adversely affect international operations include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates  changes in import export duties and quotas  introduction of tariff or non tariff barriers  potentially adverse tax consequences  possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  changes in the market for business software as a result of currency unification in europe  and economic or political changes in international markets 
the current economic difficulties in several asian countries could have an adverse impact on the company s international operations in future periods 
in addition  the company s international revenues may also be affected to a great extent by seasonal fluctuations resulting from lower sales that typically occur during the summer months in europe and other parts of the world 
dependence on key personnel  competition for employees 
the future success of the company will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain talented and qualified employees  including skilled management personnel 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for key personnel is intense  particularly so in recent years 
from time to time the company has experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining talented and qualified employees 
there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key technical  sales and managerial employees or that it can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel in the future 
the inability of the company to continue to attract talented personnel or the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
concentration of ownership 
zack b 
bergreen  the company s chief executive officer and chairman of the board  as of march   beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company 
as a result  mr 
bergreen exercises significant control over the company through his ability to influence and control the election of directors and all other matters that require action by the company s stockholders 
under certain circumstances  mr 
bergreen could prevent or delay a change of control of the company which may be favored by a significant portion of the company s other stockholders  or cause a change of control not favored by the majority of the company s other stockholders 
mr 
bergreen s ability under certain circumstances to influence  cause or delay a change in control of the company also may have an adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
risks of dependence on proprietary technology 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
the company s products are licensed to customers under signed license agreements containing  among other terms  provisions protecting against the unauthorized use  copying and transfer of the licensed program 
in addition  the company relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and non disclosure agreements to protect its proprietary rights in its products and technology 
policing unauthorized use of the company s software is difficult and  while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that measures taken by the company will be adequate to protect the company s proprietary technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies 
moreover  although the company believes that its products and technologies do not infringe on any existing proprietary rights of others  and although there are no pending lawsuits against the company regarding infringement of any existing patents or other intellectual property rights or any notices that the company is infringing the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that such infringement claims will not be asserted by third parties in the future 
any such situations can have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
risk of product defects  failure to meet performance criteria 
the company s software is intended for use in enterprise wide applications that may be critical to a customer s business 
as a result  the company s customers and potential customers typically have demanding requirements for installation and deployment 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain errors or failures  particularly when software must be customized for a particular licensee  when new products are first introduced or when new versions are released 
although the company conducts extensive product testing during product development  the company has at times delayed commercial release of software until problems were corrected and  in some cases  has provided enhancements to correct errors in released software 
the company could  in the future  lose revenues as a result of software errors or defects 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in software  customizations or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss or delay of revenue or delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
burdens of customization 
certain of the company s clients request customization of dispatch or allianceenterprise products to address unique characteristics of their businesses or computing environments 
the company s commitment to customization could place a burden on the company s client support resources or delay the delivery or installation of products which  in turn  could materially adversely affect the company s relationship with significant clients or otherwise adversely affect its business and results of operations 
in addition  the company could incur penalties or reductions in revenues for failures to develop or timely deliver new products or product enhancements under development agreements and other arrangements with customers 
possible volatility of stock price 
the market price of the common stock has in the past been  and may continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations in response to  and may be adversely affected by  variations in quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  developments in the software industry  adverse earnings or other financial announcements of the company s customers and general stock market conditions as well as other factors 
in addition  the stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time which may bear no meaningful relationship to the company s performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company does not have any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio 
the company places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
the company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   the company s investments consisted of us government agency securities  commercial paper and corporate and municipal bonds 
the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk the company does not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or purchased currency options to hedge local currency cash flows or for trading purposes 
all sales arrangements with international customers are denominated in foreign currency 
the company does not expect any material loss with respect to foreign currency risk
