item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
overview we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in october we commenced operations in november  following our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of partec ltd  our predecessor company that began its operations in january since commencing operations  our activities have been primarily devoted to developing our technologies  raising capital  purchasing assets for our corporate offices and laboratory facilities and recruiting personnel 
we are a development stage company and have no product sales to date 
our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from various private placements of equity securities and from our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
we have two wholly owned subsidiaries located in israel  keryx israel ltd  an israeli registered company  which engages in administrative functions  and keryx biomedical technologies ltd  an israeli registered company  which engages in research and development activities 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants  sponsored research associates and outside service providers for laboratory development  manufacturing expenses related to the production of clinical trial inventory materials and other expenses relating to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our product candidates 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including business development  general legal activities  and various costs relating to our operations as a public company 
our results of operations include non cash compensation expense as a result of grants of stock and stock options 
compensation expense for options granted to employees represents the difference between the intrinsic value of our common stock and the exercise price of the options at the date of grant 
we account for stock based employee and director compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  referred to as apb no 
 and financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation and comply with the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
compensation for options granted to consultants has been determined in accordance with sfas no 
 as the fair value of the equity instruments issued  and according to the guidelines set forth in eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and eitf accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees  referred to as sfas no 
apb opinion no 
has been applied in accounting for fixed and milestone based stock options to employees and directors as allowed by sfas no 
the compensation cost is recorded over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options 
the expense is included in the respective categories of expense in the statement of operations 
we expect to record additional non cash compensation expense in the future  which may be significant 
however  because some of the options issued to consultants either do not vest immediately or vest upon the achievement of certain milestones  the total expense is uncertain 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
in applying these critical accounting policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates 
these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  please see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include the following foreign currency translation 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we translate non us dollar amounts in the financial statements of our israeli subsidiaries into us dollars 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of any gains or losses resulting from this translation is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiaries 
generally  the currency in which a subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency 
however  any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements would be included as a separate part of our stockholders equity under the caption cumulative translation adjustment 
however  if the functional currency of the subsidiary is deemed to be the us dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the us dollar to be the functional currency for each of our israeli subsidiaries 
therefore all gains and losses from translations are recorded in our statement of operations 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have fully offset our us deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance 
our lack of earnings history and the uncertainty surrounding our ability to generate taxable income prior to the expiration of such deferred tax assets were the primary factors considered by management in establishing the valuation allowance 
the deferred tax asset in our financial statements relates to our wholly owned israeli subsidiaries 
stock compensation 
we have issued options and warrants to employees  directors and consultants 
in applying sfas no 
 we use the black scholes pricing model to calculate the fair market value of our options and warrants 
the black scholes model takes into account volatility in the price of our stock  the risk free interest rate  the estimated life of the option or warrant  the closing market price of our stock and the exercise price 
for purposes of the calculation  it was assumed that no dividends will be paid during the life of the options and warrants 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  total compensation expense for options issued to consultants is determined at the measurement date 
the expense is recognized over the vesting period for the options 
until the measurement date is reached  the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain 
we record option compensation based on the fair value of the options at the reporting date 
these options are then revalued  or the total compensation is recalculated based on the then current fair value  at each subsequent reporting date 
this results in a change to the amount previously recorded in respect of the option grant and additional expense or a negative expense may be recorded in subsequent periods based on changes in the assumptions used to calculate fair value  such as changes in market price  until the measurement date is reached and the compensation expense is determined 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
we did not have any revenue for the years ended december  and december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to expenses of  for the year ended december  net of non cash compensation  research and development expenses increased by  to  due primarily to growth in personnel  manufacturing expenses associated with krx clinical trial inventory and increased pre clinical work to advance our kinace platform 
we expect our research and development costs to continue to increase significantly over the next several years as we expand our research and product development efforts and implement our business strategy 
non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants was negative  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this negative non cash compensation expense was primarily due to the revaluation of previously issued options to consultants 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to expenses of  for the year ended december  net of non cash compensation  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  due primarily to increased personnel and management expenses  and increased investments in business development and facilities required to support our growth 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase over the next several years as we implement our business strategy and commercialize our products 
non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december interest income expense  net 
interest income  net  increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to income of  for the year ended december  the increase resulted from a higher level of invested funds due primarily to proceeds from our initial public offering that closed in august  that were invested for a full year in income taxes 
income tax expense decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to an expense of  for the year ended december  income tax expense is attributable to taxable income from the continuing operations of our subsidiaries in israel 
as of december   we have recorded a deferred tax asset against income taxes for the period then ended 
income taxes are related to the taxable income of our israeli subsidiaries 
this income is eliminated upon consolidation of our financial statements 
impact of inflation 
the effects of inflation and changing prices on our operations were not significant during the periods presented 
years ended december  and revenue 
we did not have any revenue for the years ended december  and december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to expenses of  for the year ended december  net of non cash compensation  research and development expenses increased by  to  due primarily to professional fees and expenditures on expansion of our existing research and development activities during the period 
non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

interest income  net  increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to an expense of  for the year ended december  the increase resulted from a higher level of invested funds due primarily to proceeds from the initial public offering that closed in august income taxes 
income tax expense increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to an expense of  for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to taxable income from the continuing operations of our single subsidiary in israel at that time 
this income is eliminated upon consolidation of our financial statements 
impact of inflation 
the effects of inflation and changing prices on our operations were not significant during the periods presented 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations from inception primarily through various private and public financings 
as of december   we had received net proceeds of million from our initial public offering and million from private placement issuances of common and preferred stock  including million raised through the contribution by holders of their notes issued by our predecessor company 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  interest receivable and short term securities 
cash used in operating activities for the period ended december  was million as compared to million for the comparable period ended december  this increase was due primarily to increased expenses associated with the expansion of our business 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the period ended december  this was primarily the result of long term investment maturities  offset by capital expenditures 
we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since our inception 
we anticipate incurring negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
we have spent  and expect to continue to spend  substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy  including our planned product development efforts  our clinical trials  and our research and discovery efforts 
as of december   we have known contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies of  of this amount   relates to research agreements  with  due during and the remaining  due in the additional  relates to operating lease obligations  of which  is due during  a total of  is due during and  with the remaining  due during payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years research agreements    operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     additionally  we have undertaken to make milestone payments to certain of our licensors  contingent upon attaining certain goals  of up to approximately million 
in certain cases  such payments will reduce any royalties due on sales of related products 
in the event that the milestones are not achieved  we remain obligated to pay one licensor  annually thereafter until the license expires 
we believe that our million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as of december  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned operating needs and capital expenditures until mid our cash and cash equivalents as of december  are invested in highly liquid investments such as cash  money market accounts  short term us corporate debt securities  and short term obligations of domestic governmental agencies 
as of december  we are unaware of any known trends or any known demands  commitments  events  or uncertainties that will  or that are reasonably likely to  result in a material increase or decrease in our required liquidity 
our liquidity needs throughout will continue to be funded from existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties 
the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following o the progress of our research activities  o the number and scope of our research programs  o the progress of our pre clinical and clinical development activities  o the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into research and development agreements  o our ability to maintain current research and development programs and to establish new research and development and licensing arrangements  o our ability to achieve our milestones under licensing arrangements  o the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and o the costs and timing of regulatory approvals 
we have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
we may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate 
potential sources of financing include strategic relationships  public or private sales of our stock or debt and other sources 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long term capital requirements 
we do not have any committed sources of financing at this time  and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted 
if we are not able to obtain financing when needed  we may be unable to carry out our business plan 
as a result  we may have to significantly limit our operations and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas and subsequently  sfas after its adoption 
we adopted the provisions of sfas as of july   and sfas is effective for periods beginning on or after january  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june   but before sfas is adopted in full  are not amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  continue to be amortized and tested for impairment prior to the full adoption of sfas upon adoption of sfas  we are required to evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new classification criteria in sfas for recognition separate from goodwill 
we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
if an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas within the first interim period 
impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with sfas s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  we are required to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we will then have up to six months from january  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
the second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the recognized and unrecognized assets and the liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of income 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas and sfas to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
we also record a corresponding asset  which is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
we are required to adopt sfas on january  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we are required to adopt sfas on january  and do not believe it will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
we maintain our portfolio in cash equivalents and short and long term interest bearing securities  including corporate debt  money market funds and government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is required
