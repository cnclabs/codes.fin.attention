this strategy also involves reducing the duration of the investment portfolio  and decreasing the potential changes in the market value of the underlying assets 
this restructuring strategy should result in reduced interest income from its investment portfolio with interest rates at current levels  but more interest income as interest rates rise

the nonperforming loans prior to the designation had a net book value of million 
the designation resulted in a million provision for possible loan and lease losses relating to nonperforming loans held for sale in the fourth quarter of  and a corresponding charge off in the same amount 
the decrease in from was due to a million special provision taken in to conform the loan reserve policies of jeff and sjb to that of the company 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses the allowance and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a monthly basis 
the methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following two criteria the establishment of reserve amounts for all specifically identified criticized loans  including those arising from business combinations  that have been designated as requiring attention by management s internal loan review program 
the establishment of reserves for pools of homogenous types of loans not subject to specific review  including family residential mortgages  consumer loans  and credit card accounts  based upon historical loss rates 
an allocation of the allowance for the non criticized loans in each portfolio and for all off balance sheet exposures is determined based upon the historical average loss experience of those portfolios 
consideration is also given to the changed risk profile brought about by the aforementioned business combinations  customer knowledge  the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending work out and collection staffs  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions and the concentration of real estate related loans located in the northeastern part of the united states 
since many of the loans depend upon the sufficiency of collateral as a secondary source of repayment  any adverse trend in the real estate markets could affect underlying values available to protect the company from loss 
other evidence used to determine the amount of the allowance and its components are as follows regulatory and other examinations the amount and trend of criticized loans actual losses peer comparisons with other financial institutions economic data associated with the real estate market in the company s area of operations opportunities to dispose of marginally performing loans for cash considerations based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all attendant factors associated with the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance for possible loan and lease losses to be adequate at december  the allowance as a percentage of total loans outstanding was at december   at december  and at december  the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans was at december   at december  and at december  the following is a summary of the activity in the allowance for possible loan and lease losses  by loan category  for the years indicated in thousands allowance for possible loan and lease losses amount of loans outstanding at end of year      daily average amount of loans outstanding      allowance for possible loan and lease losses balance at beginning of year      loans charged off real estate mortgages      commercial and industrial      consumer credit      other assets held for sale   total loans charged off      recoveries real estate mortgages   commercial and industrial      consumer credit      other total recoveries      net loans charged off      provision for possible loan and lease losses portfolio loans      provision for possible loan and lease losses non performing loans held for sale  allowance of acquired companies     balance at end of year      provision for possible loan and lease losses as a percentage of average loans outstanding net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding allowance for possible loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at year end

the company has several liquidity measurements that are evaluated on a frequent basis 
the company has adequate sources of liquidity including the ability to attract deposits from businesses and individuals through its branches  brokered deposits from securities firms  cash flow from interest  prepayments and principal repayments on investment securities and loans  securities available for sale  and the ability to borrow funds on a collateralized basis from the federal home loan bank and federal reserve discount window  repurchase agreements collateralized by securities with securities firms  and other sources 
the management of balance sheet volumes  mixes  and maturities enables the company to maintain adequate levels of liquidity 
the company does not rely on its unsecured credit ratings for borrowing senior debt to fund its operations in the institutional certificate of deposit market or debt market 
the company does rely on its unsecured credit ratings for issuing subordinated debt and capital trust securities to enhance its regulatory capital ratios 
fitch has assigned hudson united bank a rating of a for long term deposits and f for short term deposits 
in addition fitch has assigned a rating of bbb for subordinated debt and capital trust obligations of the company 
moody s has assigned to hudson united bank a baa rating for long term deposits and a rating of p for short term deposits 
standard and poor s has assigned a rating of bb to the company s subordinated debt 
any downgrading of the company s unsecured credit ratings would not cause the interest rate on any of its subordinated debt or capital trust obligations to increase  or cause the principal amount to be putable by the holders to the company 
a downgrading of the company s unsecured credit ratings could make it difficult for the company to issue additional subordinated debt or capital trust securities on attractive terms  if at all

interest rate sensitivity management ensures that the company maintains acceptable levels of net interest income throughout a range of interest rate environments 
the company seeks to maintain its interest rate risk within a range that it believes is both manageable and prudent  given its capital and income generating capacity

in addition  the company has a number of collateralized borrowing facilities with the federal home loan bank and federal reserve  primary broker dealers and other sources that are or can be used as sources of liquidity without having to sell assets to raise cash 
the company uses several measurements in monitoring its liquidity position 
at december   the company s liquidity ratios exceed all minimum standards set forth by internal policies 
the company has an asset liability management committee  which manages the risks associated with the volatility of interest rates and the resulting impact on net interest income  net income and capital 
the management of interest rate risk at the company is performed by i income simulation analysis which analyzes the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income  net income and capital over specific periods of time and captures the dynamic impact of interest rate changes on the company s mix of assets and liabilities and ii analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap 
the following table presents the gap position of the company at december  in preparing this table  management has anticipated prepayments for mortgage backed securities and mortgage related securities according to standard industry prepayment assumptions in effect at year end 
total loans include adjustable rate loans  which are placed according to repricing periods 
fixed rate residential mortgages are assumed to prepay at rates consistent with historical average housing turnover rates 
money market deposits and interest bearing demand accounts have been included in the due within days category 
assets with daily floating rates are included in the due within days category 
assets and liabilities are included in the table based on their maturities  expected cash repayments or period of first repricing  subject to the foregoing assumptions 
in analyzing its gap position  although all time periods are considered  the company emphasizes the next twelve month period 
an institution is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also repricing within that time period 
conversely  an institution is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing is less than the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing during the same period 
theoretically  in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap should result in an increase in net interest income  and in a rising interest rate environment this negative gap should adversely affect net interest income 
the converse would be true for a positive gap 
however  shortcomings are inherent in a simplified gap analysis that may result in changes in interest rates affecting net interest income more or less than the gap analysis would indicate 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating gap 
also  gap does not permit analysis of how changes in the mix of various assets and liabilities and growth rate assumptions impact net interest income 
the following table shows the gap position of the company at december  in thousands due within one due between one year and due over five or less five years years total assets securities     total loans     total earning assets     percent of total earning assets liabilities interest bearing deposits     borrowings     total interest bearing liabilities     percent of total interest rate sensitivity gap before off balance sheet derivatives     off balance sheet derivatives    gap after off balance sheet derivatives     gap as a percent of earnings assets due in part to the shortcomings of gap analysis  the asset liability committee of the company believes that financial simulation modeling more accurately estimates the effects and exposure on net interest income to changes in interest rates 
it attempts to measure the degree to which the interest income and interest expense on certain assets and liabilities which are directly leveled to market indices  such as fed funds or the prime rate or libor  may change as market interest rate changes 
it also attempts to measure the degree to which interest expense on deposits  the rates which are administered by the bank s management  but which need to be generally competitive with the administered deposit rates established by other banks  may change as market interest rates change  and the degree to which balances in deposit accounts may change due to changes in administered rates implemented by the bank s management 
it additionally attempts to measure how changes in the composition of the investment portfolio may change the potential interest income and cash flow of the bank  and how hedging instruments such as interest rate derivatives may be used to change the interest sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities 
as such  net interest income simulation is designed to address the likely probability of changes in net interest income as a result of interest rate changes and behavioral response of the components of the balance sheet to those changes 
the market value of portfolio equity represents the fair values of the net present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items 
financial modeling is performed under several scenarios including a regulatory rate shock scenario which measures changes in net interest income over the next twelve months and market value of portfolio equity given instantaneous and sustained changes in interest rates 
during  the company entered into a series of derivative contracts interest rate swaps  floors and caps to hedge the variability of its net interest income 
these agreements are entered into as hedges against interest rate risk and are designated against specific assets and liabilities 
the notional amount of the derivative contracts totaled million at december  the purpose of these contracts is to limit the volatility in the company s net interest income and net interest margin in the event of changes in interest rates 
management did not enter into these contracts for speculative purposes 
under sfas no 
 the company has adopted hedge accounting for these contracts 
sfas no 
states that the net payments under the contracts should be recorded in interest income and the change in valuation of the contracts should be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in total stockholders equity 
changes in interest rates will impact the cash flows and valuation of the derivative contracts  but management does not expect the overall financial statement impact to be material under any interest rate scenario
