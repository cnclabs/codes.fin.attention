item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and other information included in this report 
the financial results reported herein do not indicate the financial results that may be achieved by the company in any future period 
background monterey pasta company was incorporated in june as a producer and wholesaler of refrigerated gourmet pasta and sauces to restaurants and grocery stores in the monterey  california area 
the company has since expanded its operations to provide a variety of gourmet refrigerated food products to grocery and club stores throughout the united states  selected regions in canada  the caribbean  latin america  and asia pacific 
the company s overall strategic plan is to enhance the value of the monterey pasta company brand name by distributing its gourmet products through multiple channels of distribution 
the company s product distribution to grocery and club stores increased from approximately stores as of december  to approximately  by december  declined to approximately  as of december  and increased  once again  to approximately  stores by december  during  and  significant costs were incurred to promote the expansion that occurred  including product demonstration  advertising  warehousing  and distribution costs and the hiring of additional personnel 
in  the focus was changed to developing a profitable distribution base 
hence  the reduction in store totals  and the return to profitability 
during through  the company added profitable retail and club distribution including approximately additional club stores  retail stores as part of the march  frescala foods acquisition  and several new retail chains comprising approximately  stores 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue will depend on three key factors whether grocery and club store chains will continue to increase the number of their stores offering the company s products  whether the company can continue to increase the number of grocery and club store chains offering its products  and continued introduction of new products that meet consumer acceptance 
grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores  and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future or that such chains will not reduce the number of stores carrying the company s products 
the company believes that access to substantially greater capital resources  coupled with continued reduction of its administrative and production costs as a percent of sales revenue  will be key requirements in the company s efforts to enhance its competitive position and increase its market penetration 
in order to support its expansion program  the company has developed  and is continuing to develop new products for consumers and revised advertising and promotional activities for its retail grocery and club store accounts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its net revenues from grocery and club stores 
because the company will continue to make expenditures associated with the expansion of its business  the company s results of operations may be affected 
operations for  and net revenues from were   and  for   and  respectively  reflecting an annual increase in sales of for  when compared to  and a increase for when compared to the and increases resulted from same store sales growth as well as increased store numbers from approximately  at the end of to approximately  individual grocery and club stores by year end of  and approximately  at year end the sales level represents a compound annual average growth since  when sales were  of over 
gross margin for remained close to the level at compared with  although the last quarter of evidenced an increase in gross margin at  when compared to the first three quarters  which averaged 
gross margin in was 
the decline was influenced by significant energy cost increases in the first two quarters  substantial increases in dairy ingredients affecting the first ten months of in varying degrees  and production inefficiencies associated with the rapid national rollout of the successful borsellini and calzone product lines 
electricity prices at year end were higher than they were in january of natural gas prices increased in excess of compared with average year levels by march of by year end they were approximately below year average levels 
the production inefficiencies related to the borsellini and calzone lines were completely resolved by the middle of quarter three 
dairy ingredients at year end were tracking at or below levels originally budgeted for  although the decline did not begin influencing margins until the middle of the fourth quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to  up  or from  in  which had increased  or from the increase resulted from variable expense increase associated with the sales increase 
it also reflected an increased investment in marketing expenditures  most notably product demonstrations  the addition of several salaried positions to further support growth  and  in non cash compensation expense related to performance based stock options granted to executives in year eliminating the one time option compensation expense would reduce the sg a increase from to the increase in over resulted primarily from variable costs associated with the sales increase 
sg a expenses as a percent of sales were   and for   and  respectively 
adjusting for the one time option compensation expense would reduce sg a expense as a percent of sales for to 
management believes the current level of sg a expenses is consistent with efficient operations  and additional expenses in future periods  mainly in the sales and marketing area  will be directly associated with increased levels of sales 
depreciation and amortization expense  included in cost of sales and sg a  increased to  or of net revenues in  compared to  or of net revenues in  and  or in the increases over the past two years relate primarily to capital expenditures in the salinas  california production facility and the addition of the frescala foods business that added  amortization expense during   in  and  in the acquisition of the nate s polenta business in december see liquidity  capital resources and business acquisitions  page added  in amortization expense in the company anticipates further increase in depreciation expense in future periods as additional equipment is purchased and placed in service 
because of the changes associated with statement of financial accounting standards see new accounting pronouncements on page  however  amortization of existing intangibles is expected to decline from  in to  in net interest income of  was recognized in compared to net interest expense of  in and  in the interest income was generated from investment in short term money funds  pending the need for investment in capital assets or a potential acquisition 
at year end  the company had no bank debt and the net interest income for the year included  of interest expense from financing leases 
the decrease in interest expense compared with resulted from the reduction of  and by the end of quarter three  the elimination of debt resulting from increased profitability 
see consolidated balance sheets page 
income tax benefit expense for   and was   and  respectively 
the benefit resulted primarily from the reversal of prior valuation allowances against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had experienced three consecutive years of increasingly profitable operations 
accordingly  a portion of the valuation allowance totaling  was reversed in  since we believed it was more likely than not that at least this portion of deferred tax assets  relating to net operating loss carryforwards nols  california manufacturer s tax credits  and various timing differences  would be realized 
additional reserves were reversed in in  we realized additional actual tax benefits as a result of the exercise of non qualified stock options and the exercise and subsequent sale of certain incentive stock options disqualifying dispositions 
for financial reporting purposes  any resulting reduction in income tax obligations is credited to additional paid in capital 
in  estimated income tax expense of  was offset for actual cash liability purposes by use of nols  the tax credits  and the effect of current year disqualifying dispositions 
accordingly  estimated income tax liability for is only  towards which  has been paid as of december   leaving a prepayment of  associated with future income tax expense may fluctuate significantly depending upon the outcome of a tax court case involving a similar tax situation which may result in our ability to use approximately million in additional nols relating to our previously owned subsidiary upscale food outlets  inc ufo  currently covered with a valuation reserve as we cannot yet determine that utilization of these nols is probable 
alternatively  it is at least possible that approximately million in ufo nols already utilized might be disallowed 
see also liquidity  capital resources and business acquisition deferred tax assets and note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity  capital resources  and business acquisitions during the twelve months ended december    of cash was provided by the company s operations  compared to  provided in the decline in net income of  was offset by a  decrease in deferred tax assets  leaving a net increase of  attributable to profit performance associated with operations 
the company accrued  in tax expense for book purposes but paid only  in cash taxes for year due primarily to utilization of nols as discussed above 
the million increase in net cash income over net income plus depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and non cash compensation expense was partially offset by growth in the working capital components to support the sales growth 
the  increase in prepaid expenses was a result of a  reclassification of operating supplies inventory from the production inventory account  increased prepaid insurance and taxes of  and other prepaid expense increases of  mainly associated with customer programs 
the improvement in cash flow from operations followed a improvement of over  most of which was contributed by an increased net cash income  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
the accounts payable balance included nearly  in accrued fixed asset expenditures associated with the significant plant expansion program completed in the accounts payable balance was  lower because of a much lower level of capital commitments at year end 
the company currently has a credit facility  which was renegotiated in august  for million in aggregate borrowings  of which zero was outstanding at december  see note to the financial statements 
the million working capital portion of the facility is priced at either prime rate or libor  plus basis points for a debt tangible net worth ratio of  with libor premiums increasing in basis point increments based on increased debt tangible net worth increments of 
the million non revolving term portion of the facility pricing is at either prime rate or libor plus premiums for the same debt tangible net worth ratios beginning at basis points over libor and increasing basis points for successive debt tangible net worth increments 
the term loan facility is subject to annual review if unused 
if used it converts to an month term loan 
a term note from the same institution  in the amount of  was obtained in march to assist with the frescala foods acquisition discussed below  and was repaid in september a total of  in cash was used in in connection with the nate s polenta acquisition  including costs associated with the transaction  compared with  in associated with the march acquisition of frescala foods  inc discussed below 
in addition   in cash was used to purchase equipment and leasehold improvements in  compared to  in approximately million of the capital expenditures were part of a million capital plan approved by the company s board of directors in october for the period of october through december the company made additional capital expenditures in of approximately million to expand production capability  improve packaging efficiency and maintain quality and upgrade utilities including boiler capacity and waste water treatment  as well as another 
million for a stuffed pizza calzone line 
the company invested million in capital assets in major projects included approximately  for expansion of and improvements in the pizza calzone line  approximately  for ingredients blending upgrade  and over  for the borsellini dies and pasta machines 
the company also invested over  in facility improvements to enhance sanitation and support growth  and  in new or improved packaging equipment  as well as many other capital projects designed to support growth  improve processes  or assist in compliance issues 
the company anticipates capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
all future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with a combination of cash flow from operations and use of the company s credit facility 
on march   the company purchased the operating assets and inventory of frescala foods  inc frescala  a san antonio  texas based fresh pasta and sauce producer with an emphasis on private label production 
the consideration to frescala consisted of  in cash plus fully vested options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the options had an approximate fair market value of  an exercise price of per share  and a three year expiration 
additionally  frescala owners received an earn out of  as of october  based upon frescala sales above a predetermined level 
funding for the transaction came from a new  two year term loan  since repaid  use of existing accounts receivable and inventory line  and cash flow from operations 
the total consideration for frescala of  plus related acquisition costs of  was allocated to identifiable fixed assets totaling  and inventories of  the balance of  which includes trademarks and recipes not specifically quantifiable  was charged to goodwill 
on december   the company purchased the nate s polenta business of south san francisco  california for a total consideration of  plus related acquisition costs of  approximately  was allocated to inventory 
the remaining  which included recipes  a licensing agreement  and customer list was charged to goodwill 
additionally  nate s former owners could have received an earn out of a maximum of  to be paid as of august  based upon nate s sales above a predetermined level 
however  sales did not reach the predetermined level so no additional payment was made 
management believes that the company s million credit facility  cash generated from operations  and its current cash balance will provide adequate funding to meet its needs for normal operations and capital purchases through deferred tax assets due to the prior history of losses  a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was provided in and earlier years  as we could not determine that it was more likely than not that we could use them 
as of december   however  we had experienced three consecutive years of increasingly profitable operations 
accordingly  we reversed a portion of the valuation allowance totaling  at year end  since we believed it was more likely than not that at least this portion of deferred tax assets would be realized 
additional reserves  other than those referred to below  were reversed in the findings in a federal court case for an unrelated party involving some similar issues and fact patterns indicated that we would probably not be able to use certain net operating losses nols arising in connection with our previously owned subsidiary upscale food outlets  inc ufo 
accordingly  beginning of year federal nols in were reduced  as were the related deferred tax assets 
the resulting reduction in related gross deferred tax assets had no income statement effect in since they had been fully reserved in prior years 
in late  however  this federal court case was reversed on appeal 
the internal revenue service has issued a notice indicating it does not agree with the federal court s decision 
the irs has recommended  and the government has filed  a petition for rehearing and reconsideration with the federal circuit court 
thus  although the deferred tax assets related to the nols have been restored  amounts potentially available for future usage are substantially all reserved  as it cannot currently be determined that their utilization is probable 
we believe that the ufo nols utilized to date of approximately million will probably not be disallowed  as it is more likely that any negative determination through the tax court or legislatively would be prospective in nature 
as this case progresses  we will continue to re evaluate whether we can utilize any portion of the nols relating to ufo 
any such positive determination would reduce both income tax expense for book purposes and the amounts actually payable to the federal taxing authorities 
the disallowance of any previous ufo nol usage would increase both income tax expense and amounts actually payable 
sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing strategy is twofold and targets sustainable growth in distribution of its products and the introduction of innovative new products to keep the company positioned as the gourmet refrigerated category leader in the marketplace 
its focus is on increasing sales through expansion of its club store and retail grocery business 
after gaining over new club stores during and  expansion of the company s club store business continued in with the rollout of the company s products in costco s los angeles and san diego divisions with total warehouses 
the company s presence in costco was approximately stores at year end distribution of the company s products also continues to grow with the national expansion of sam s club 
monterey pasta s products are now found in approximately sam s club locations  an increase of approximately stores over during  the company s retail grocery distribution increased significantly with the addition of over ralph s stores in california  stores of denver based king soopers  stores of norfolk  va based farm fresh  inc  smart and final stores throughout the western united states  as well as a third direct store delivery route in northern california 
it also acquired new stores with the march frescala acquisition  of which it retained approximately during  the net retail store increase was approximately  with the addition of whole foods and wild oats stores  raley s  super targets  vons  furr s  and the balance  over  stores from an increased presence with a large private label customer  to whom the company formerly sold its branded product 
monterey pasta s products typically are made with no preservatives or artificial ingredients 
capitalizing on this strength  the company continues to pursue increased distribution through natural and organic food retailers  whose growth has exceeded in recent years 
the company estimates there are potential natural and organic retail grocery stores available  as potential markets for its products 
during  the company continued its emphasis on bringing innovative new products to the market place with the introduction of refrigerated stuffed pizzas  calzones  pierogies  a tortilla soup  and a vodka sauce 
the refrigerated pizzas and calzones were introduced late in the third quarter with a guaranteed shelf life of days  and  to the company s knowledge  are the only extended shelf life refrigerated pizzas and calzones 
the pierogies  introduced in the first quarter of  are also the only extended shelf life refrigerated pierogy the company is aware of  have been accepted nationally at sam s club stores  and have regional distribution elsewhere 
these introductions are part of an ongoing effort to rapidly introduce new products in the refrigerated section  which further enhance the company s gourmet image 
expansion of the company s club store business took on an international flavor during with the introduction of the company s products into the eastern canada division of costco  as well as costco locations in mexico  and locations in asia pacific 
the company s products are now found in approximately costco wholesale locations 
distribution of the company s products also continues to grow with the national expansion of sam s club  and the introduction of the company s products into sam s club locations in mexico 
monterey pasta s products are now found in approximately sam s club locations 
during the company s retail business increased significantly with an additional albertson s stores including in the metro phoenix market  and in northern california  over dominick s stores in the metro chicago market  and jerry s enterprises stores in the upper midwest  which average  square feet in size 
the company also acquired significant retail business with its purchase of the nate s polenta brand in late the nate s polenta business added distribution to over retail outlets 
at end of  the company had distribution in over  retail outlets 
in  the company continued its emphasis on bringing innovative new products to the marketplace with the introduction of two new product lines veil thin pasta and italian classic sauces 
veil thin pasta features a delicate dough that is significantly thinner than traditional refrigerated pasta doughs 
the company s first offering in the veil thin line is its borsellini  which wraps gourmet fillings in small pouches of veil thin dough 
the product line has enjoyed considerable success in both retail and club store accounts 
the italian classics sauce line expands the company s sauce offerings  and features three varieties of traditional style italian sauces 
italian classics sauces can be found in both retail and club store accounts 
in addition  the company also added significantly to its existing line of refrigerated  fresh calzones during the year  and was successful in introducing them to both retail and club store accounts 
business risks certain characteristics and dynamics of the company s business and of financial markets generally create risks to the company s long term success and to predictable quarterly results 
these risks include no assurance of continued profitability 
in the second quarter of  the company reported its first operating loss from continuing operations 
subsequent to that quarter the company incurred losses through the first quarter of  after which it regained profitability  which has continued for nineteen consecutive quarters 
at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  there can be no assurance that the company will maintain its recent profitability in the long or short term 
liquidity need for additional capital 
management believes that its current cash balances  operations and existing bank lines of credit will provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s planned capital and operating requirements for normal operations and capital expenditures through the next twelve months  assuming that its existing bank lines can be extended when they expire in october  in addition  the disallowance of a significant portion of previously utilized ufo nols might require an unexpected cash outlay 
if the company s operations do not provide cash sufficient to fund its operations  and the company seeks outside financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing when needed  on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  any future equity financing or convertible debt financing would cause the company s stockholders to incur dilution in net tangible book value per share of common stock 
hiring and retention of key personnel 
the success of the company depends on its ability to retain key executives  and to motivate and retain other key employees and officers 
the company has key man insurance policies in place  each in the face amount of  for its chief executive officer  r 
lance hewitt  and its chief financial officer  stephen l 
brinkman 
there can be no assurance that significant management turnover will not occur in the future 
impact of inflation 
except for dairy ingredients and energy price increases  see california energy crisis and dairy ingredients prices risks on page  the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations through substantial increases in labor  employee benefits  freight  ingredients and packaging  rents and other operating expenses  and further increases in cheese and energy prices could adversely affect the operations of the company s business in future periods 
the company cannot predict whether such increases will occur in the future  or their magnitude 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated substantially since the initial public offering of the company s common stock in december such volatility may  in part  be attributable to the company s operating results or to changes in the direction of the company s expansion efforts 
in addition  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets or the food industry  natural disasters or other developments affecting the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies  including the company  for reasons sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
any shortfall in the company s net sales or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts or the market could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter 
this could result in an even more immediate and significant adverse impact on the trading price of the company s common stock upon announcement of the shortfall or quarterly operating results 
risks inherent in food production 
the company faces all of the risks inherent in the production and distribution of refrigerated food products  including contamination  adulteration and spoilage  and the associated risks of product liability litigation  which may be associated with even an isolated event 
the company has a modern production facility  employs what it believes is state of the art thermal processing  temperature controlled storage  haacp programs intended to insure food safety  and has obtained usda approval for its production plant 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s procedures will be adequate to prevent the occurrence of such events 
dependence on major customers 
during  two customers  costco and sam s club stores  accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
the company currently sells its products to seven separate costco regions approximately stores which make purchasing decisions independently of one another 
these regions re evaluate  on a regular basis  the products carried in their stores 
there can be no assurance that these costco regions will continue to offer monterey pasta products in the future or continue to allocate monterey pasta the same amount of shelf space 
the company also supplies its products to approximately sam s club stores 
purchasing decisions are made at the company headquarters with input from the store level 
while the company is in the fifth year of its relationship with sam s  and this relationship is expected to continue  there can be no assurance that sam s club stores will continue to carry its products 
loss of either of these customers  costco or sam s club  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
seasonality and quarterly results 
the company s grocery and club store accounts are expected to experience seasonal fluctuations to some extent 
the company s business in general may also be affected by a variety of other factors  including but not limited to general economic trends  competition  marketing programs  and special or unusual events 
competition and dependence on common carriers 
the company s business continues to be dominated by several very large competitors  which have significantly greater resources than the company  such competitors can outspend the company and negatively affect the company s market share and results of operations 
the company also continues to be dependent on common carriers to distribute its products 
any disruption in its distribution system or increase in the costs thereof could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
california energy crisis 
during  california experienced an energy crisis that could have disrupted the company s operations and did increase the company s energy expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  when power reserves for california fall below  electricity providers have on some occasions implemented  and may in the future implement  rolling blackouts 
if blackouts interrupt the power supply to the company s production facilities  such facilities would temporarily be unable to continue production 
any such interruption could result in a loss of revenue as a result of reduced production and  in severe cases  spoilage of food products 
in addition  related to the energy crisis  many of the electricity and natural gas suppliers raised their rates substantially during the first six months of because the company has most of its operations in california  its operating costs are affected by an increase in electricity and natural gas prices 
as a result  the company s operating results are likely to be affected in some measure by the current california energy crisis 
electricity prices have remained unchanged from may through december  while natural gas prices have declined substantially from their levels in the first five months of management cannot predict the level of future energy prices with certainty 
marketing and sales risks 
the future success of the company s efforts will depend on a number of factors  including whether grocery and club store chains will continue to expand the number of their individual stores offering the company s products and whether allowances and other incentives will expand retail distribution 
expansion into new markets increases the risk of significant product returns resulting from the company s supply of slower selling items to its customers 
in addition  grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future 
should these channels choose to reduce or eliminate products  the company could experience a significant reduction in its product sales 
as indicated previously  the company remains dependent on the use of slotting allowances and other incentives to expand retail distribution 
in order to reduce risk  the company has significantly reduced expansion into new markets requiring such major expenditures 
dairy ingredients prices 
during the first ten months of average price of certain dairy ingredients increased over compared with the average of the prior twelve months  as measured by butterfat prices published by the state of california department of food and agriculture 
because the company utilizes various dairy ingredients in many of its products  its operating costs will be affected by an increase in those ingredients 
the company s operating results were affected in the first eleven months of  and could be affected in some measure in future months by price increases 
dairy ingredients historically tend to be cyclical in nature and subject to declines in price as well as increases 
management cannot predict with certainty the duration or magnitude of the current price cycle

sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and for purchase business combinations completed on or after july  it also requires  upon adoption of sfas that we reclassify the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in sfas sfas requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas requires that we identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in sfas sfas is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
sfas requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption
