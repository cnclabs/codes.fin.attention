the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that effect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  financing obligations  restructuring costs  retirement benefits and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are our critical accounting policies we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income 
our judgements regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  our ability to continue to successfully execute our strategy and other factors 
we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgements 
changes in business strategy and or market conditions may significantly impact these judgements and require adjustment to the recorded asset balances 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the transfer of title and risk of loss has occurred  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
this recognition criteria is met at the time the product is delivered to the customer s site 
product sales are recorded net of returns at the time revenue is recognized 
sales related to services are generally recognized over the contract term using the percentage of completion method 
billings in excess of revenue on service contracts are recorded as deferred income until the revenue recognition criteria are met

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rate which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facility 
our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately million 
fluctuations in interest rates will not affect the interest payable on the senior subordinated notes  which is fixed 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we also have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the cash flows received from our foreign affiliates 
this risk is mitigated by the fact that their operations are conducted in their respective local currencies 
currently  we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 business combination 
the provisions of fas i require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   ii provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill  and iii require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
fas also requires that upon adoption of fas the company reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill  based on certain criteria 
fas supersedes apb  intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of fas i prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  ii require that goodwill and indefinite live intangible assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  iii require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  and iv remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
the company will adopt the provisions of fas in its first quarter ended march  the company is in the process of preparing for its adoption of fas and is making the determinations as to what its reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill  intangible assets  other assets  and liabilities should be allocated to those reporting units 
in connection with the adoption of fas  the company will reclassify approximately million of assembled workforce from other intangible assets into goodwill and will no longer record approximately million of amortization relating to its existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
fas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step 
the company expects to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of the company s fiscal year 
intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment using a one step process which compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year  and pursuant to the requirements of fas will be completed during the first quarter of any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the second quarter of the company has not yet determined what effect these impairment tests will have on the company s earnings and financial position 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no  accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity is required to capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and will be adopted by the company effective fiscal the company believes adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
because fas did not address the accounting for a segment of a business accounted for as a discontinued operation under apb  two accounting models existed for long lived assets to be disposed 
fas establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in fas  for long lived assets to be disposed 
it also addresses certain significant implementation issues under fas the provisions of fas will be effective for the company as of the beginning of fiscal year the company believes adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements
