economic conditions have caused our customers to reevaluate their capital spending plans  and to defer previously planned projects for information technology infrastructure 
however  we believe the need for storage networking solutions is significant and will continue to increase 
due to the slowdown in customer spending for information technology infrastructure  we took cost reduction actions in april that reduced our quarterly expense run rate  including a percent workforce reduction a wage freeze for all employees a percent pay cut for executive management a percent pay cut for selected other employees  and significant reductions in discretionary spending 
the reduction in demand for our products and services also resulted in the following charges in the first quarter of million to write down slow moving inventory  for the write off of our filespeed product  and  for restructuring  principally severance 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge for the future costs associated with a facility that was abandoned prior to the expiration of the lease term and a million charge for the write off of non storage networking related products 
we reversed the unused portion of the million charge for the abandoned facility in the third quarter of the amount of the reversal was  
table of contents sale and write down of webmethods stock during the first quarter of  we sold  shares of webmethods stock received from the sale of intelliframe for approximately million  resulting in a pre tax loss of approximately million

discontinued operations divestiture of propelis software  inc propelis software  inc  formerly known as our enterprise integration solutions division  developed and sold our enterprise application integration  or eai  software that automates the integration of computer software applications and business workflow processes 
in august  we determined to divest propelis software  inc and focus on our core storage networking business 
as a result  propelis software  inc has been accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements  meaning that the division s revenues and expenses are not shown and its net income loss for all periods are included under the discontinued operations caption in our statement of operations 
during  we sold substantially all of the assets of our discontinued operations in a series of transactions 
these included the sale of our intelliframe subsidiary to webmethods and the sale of other assets to jacada ltd 
all outstanding options to purchase stock of propelis software have been cancelled or have lapsed 
on february  we sold all of the outstanding stock of intelliframe corporation  including the technology underlying our propelis bpm product  to webmethods  inc for million in cash and  shares of webmethods common stock 
the stock received from webmethods  inc was valued at million  which reflects a discount from its publicly reported trading price due to the initial restrictions placed on our ability to freely sell the stock 
in connection with this transaction  we paid million to two employees  who were former shareholders of intelliframe  to satisfy all obligations to make further bonus payments under their employment agreements

we may redeem the notes upon payment of the outstanding principal balance  accrued interest and a make whole premium if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least consecutive trading days within a period of consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date we mail the redemption notice 
we are required and intend to register million shares within days of the original issuance of the notes 

table of contents change in year end on january   we changed our fiscal year end to january st  from december st 
we believe the twelve months ended december  provide a meaningful comparison to the twelve months ended january  and there are no factors  seasonal or otherwise  that would impact the comparability of information or trends  if results for the twelve months ended january  were presented in lieu of results for the twelve months ended december  references in this form k to fiscal and represent the twelve months ended january  and  respectively 
references to fiscal year represent the twelve months ended december  accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  management applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment for product sales with standard configurations and product sales with other than standard configurations which have demonstrated performance in accordance with its customer s specifications prior to shipment provided that a evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred  c the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  and d collectibility is assured 
all other product sales are recognized when customer acceptance is received or the passage of the customer acceptance period 
we accrue for warranty costs and sales returns at the time of shipment based on experience 
in transactions that include multiple products and or services  we allocate the sales value among each of the deliverables based on their relative fair values 
service fees are recognized as revenue when earned  which is generally on a straight line basis over the contracted service period or as the services are rendered 
deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of service agreements billed in advance to customers 
valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in addition  we also make estimates of potential future product returns 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns  we consider specific accounts  changes in customer payment terms  historical write offs and returns  changes in customer demand and relationships  concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness 
changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs and product returns 
valuation of inventory we review obsolescence to determine that inventory items deemed obsolete are appropriately reserved 
in making the determination we consider our history of inventory write offs  future sales of related products  and quantity of inventory at the balance sheet date assessed against our past usage rates and future expected usage rates 
changes in factors such as technology  customers demand  competitor product introductions and other matters could affect the level of inventory obsolescence in the future 

table of contents valuation of deferred taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for incomes taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction where we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as the depreciable life of fixed assets for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe recovery is unlikely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase the valuation allowance in a given period  we must increase tax expense within our statement of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million at january  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize certain state and foreign tax credits and loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets are recoverable 
in the event actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived and intangibles assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net long lived and intangible assets  and goodwill amounted to million at january   and no asset impairments were identified as of that date 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective february  as a result  we have ceased amortizing goodwill at february  of million 
in  we recorded amortization expense related to this goodwill of  which will no longer be required in in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
upon completion of any impairment review  there can no be assurance that a material charge will not be required 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth financial data for our continuing operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue except for gross profit  which is expressed as a percentage of the related revenue 
the segment operating information presented below is for illustrative purposes only and has been adjusted to eliminate the effects of special items and other charges recognized by our networking solutions division during the first quarter of  including a million write down of inventory  a  write off of our filespeed product and a  restructuring charge 
the segment operating information eliminates special charges recognized by our networking solutions division in the fourth quarter of  including million for the write off of non san related products and million for

we expect sales of channel extension products to continue for the foreseeable future but do not expect revenues to grow substantially 
revenue for our networking solutions division was negatively impacted in as economic conditions caused our customers to reevaluate their capital spending plans  and to defer previously planned projects for information technology infrastructure 
during  partner relationships with stk and compaq generated significant product revenue 
sales of the dxe product to stk contributed million of product revenue in  compared to million of product revenue in we discontinued the dxe rde product line in march  and are transitioning the customer base to our ultranet products 
an oem agreement with compaq contributed million of product revenue in no revenue was generated from this oem agreement in maintenance revenue increased in to million from million in the increase in revenue is due to the growing installed base of customers using our networking products 
the maintenance revenue growth rate slowed in compared to due to the decline in networking product revenue in in addition  some customers elected not to re new maintenance agreements in for our older channelink products 

table of contents storage solutions prior to our acquisition of articulent in april  our storage solutions division consisted of our san products and storage networking design and implementation services 
revenue from our storage solutions division increased in to million  an increase of from million in the acquisition of articulent in april significantly expanded our solution offerings and accounted for most of the increase 
years ended january  and december  networking solutions our networking solutions division generated revenue of million in  an increase of  from million in storage networking applications for both open systems and mainframes continued to drive new product revenue 
storage networking related product revenue increased in to million from million in sales of channel extension product applications increased in to million from million in during  partner relationships with stk and compaq generated significant product revenue 
sales of the dxe product to stk contributed million of product revenue in  while our oem relationship with compaq contributed million of product revenue 
maintenance revenue increased in to million from million in the increase in revenue is due to the growing installed base of customers using our networking products 
storage solutions revenue from our san products and storage networking design and implementation services increased in to million from million in the increase is due to greater customer demand for storage area networks and storage networking 
these applications tend to be highly complex  and for these reasons  businesses often outsource their design and implementation to third parties 
in addition  we were just starting to increase our investment in these service areas in  resulting in additional revenue in general revenue from the sale of products and services outside the united states decreased by or million in when compared to  and increased by or million in when compared to we derived  and of our revenue outside the united states in  and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue generated outside the united states in is primarily attributable to the global economic slow down and reduced spending on information technology by our customers 
in addition  the articulent business acquired in april is primarily focused in the united states and does not have a significant presence in international markets 
no single customer accounted for more than of our revenue in  or price discounting had a small impact on revenue generated by our networking solutions business in in  approximately  and of our product revenue was derived from businesses in the financial services  telecommunications and information outsourcing industries  respectively 
we primarily sell our storage networking products directly to end user customers in connection with joint marketing activities with our business partners 
for a new customer  the initial sales and design cycle  from first contact through shipment  can vary from days to months or more 
we expect that this cycle will continue 
we expect continued quarter to quarter fluctuations in revenue in both domestic and international markets 
the timing of sizable orders  because of their relative impact on total quarterly sales for both our networking and storage solutions divisions  may contribute to such fluctuations 
the level of product 
table of contents sales reported by us in any given period will continue to be affected by the receipt and fulfillment of sizable new orders in both domestic and international markets 
gross profit margin years ended january  and january  networking solutions excluding the million write down of slow moving inventory and the  write off of our filespeed product in the first quarter of  gross profit margins from the sale of networking products were in compared to in the decline in gross margin percentage was due to the continued movement in sales mix toward our ultranet products which carry a lower margin than our older channelink products  and higher levels of sales discounts 
gross service margins for our networking maintenance business improved in to from in the improvement was due to the steadily increasing base of customers contracting for maintenance services  the cost reduction actions that were taken in april  and a change in third party maintenance and logistic suppliers in that also reduced our costs 
storage solutions gross profit margins from the sale of storage solutions products were in compared to in the decline in gross margin percentage was primarily due to an increase in the sale of lower margin third party products resulting from the acquisition of articulent in april historically  the product solutions offered by articulent have generated gross margins in the to range 
gross profit margins from storage solutions services were a negative in compared to a positive in the decline in gross margin percentage and negative gross margin in is due to the fixed cost structure of the services business and low levels of service revenue in the service costs for the solutions business  mainly people  tend to be fixed in nature 
we expect to generate a gross profit from services in the future as business volumes pick up 
years ended january  and december  networking solutions gross profit margins from the sale of networking products were in  compared to in excluding a million charge for the write off of non storage networking related products  gross profit margins from the sale of products would have been in the decrease in gross profit margins to from in was due to an increase in sales of our dxe product to stk  and our ultranet gateway product to compaq  both of which carry lower gross margins  but comparable operating margins  than our channelink and ultranet products sold through direct channels 
gross profit margins for our networking maintenance business were and in and  respectively 
the improvement was due to the steadily increasing base of customers contracting for maintenance services 
storage solutions gross profit margins from the sale of storage solutions products were in there were no storage solutions product sales in  as we were just starting to invest in our storage solutions business and were not offering storage solution products 
gross profit margins from our storage solution services were in compared to in the decline in gross profit margin in was due to our hiring additional technical and consulting personnel to expand our storage solutions service offerings and capabilities

engineering and development expense increased in to million from million in the increase was primarily due to continued development of our ultranet family of products  particularly the ultranet edge product  which generated over million of revenue since its introduction in the third quarter of this increase was partially offset by the cost reduction actions take in april  including the workforce reduction  wage cuts and reductions in discretionary spending 
storage solutions sales  marketing  engineering and development expense increased in to million from million in the increase was primarily due to the incremental costs associated with the acquisition of articulent in april  including wages for approximately new employees and related costs such as travel  training and facilities 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in the increase in expense is primarily due to the acquisition of articulent  including additional costs for insurance and professional fees

years ending january  and december  networking solutions sales and marketing expense increased in to million from million in the increase in expense resulted from higher commissions  wages  fringe benefits and travel associated with additional headcount required to generate the increase in product revenue for engineering and development expense increased in to million from million in the increase was primarily due to continued development of our ultranet family of products that provide customers with additional applications to satisfy their growing storage networking capabilities 
during  we announced storage networking over standard ip solutions  including tape  scsi and fibre channel over ip to strengthen our presence in the ip solutions market 
we made investments in additional employees to develop these new applications 
storage solutions sales and marketing expense associated with our storage solutions division increased to million in from nothing in when we were just starting to invest in our storage solutions business 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased in to million from million in the increase was due to higher costs for wages  insurance and professional fees required to support the growth in our business 

table of contents other years ending january  and and december  excluding the loss from the sale and write down of webmethods stock  other income in and increased by million and million  respectively  when compared to the prior year due to an increase in interest income resulting from higher balances of cash and marketable securities available for investment partially offset by lower yields 
in october of  we raised million from a secondary stock offering 
pending use of the offering proceeds for general corporate purposes or complementary acquisitions  the funds have been invested in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
the proceeds from our recently completed convertible debt offering will be similarly invested until used for general working capital purposes including potential acquisitions 
changes in interest expense in  and are due to fluctuations in the balance of capital lease obligations 
interest expense is expected to increase by million per quarter as a result of our recent sale of million of convertible subordinated notes due february we recorded a provision for income taxes at an effective tax rate of in  and at an effective tax rate of and in and  respectively 
the fluctuations in our effective tax rate are primarily due to the large special charges recorded in and  the amount of nondeductible foreign losses and fluctuations in the level of benefit from our foreign sales corporation 
we also recorded an  valuation allowance in for certain state and foreign tax credits and loss carryforwards 
utilization of these benefits in future periods was determined to be unlikely 
based on an assessment of our taxable earnings history and prospective future taxable income  we have determined it to be more likely than not that our remaining net deferred tax asset will be realized in future periods 
we may be required to provide a valuation allowance for this asset in the future if we do not generate sufficient taxable income as planned 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through the public and private sale of equity securities  bank borrowings under lines of credit  capital and operating equipment leases and cash generated by operations 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at january  totaled million  a decrease of million since january  operations utilized million of cash in  primarily to fund our operating loss and discontinued operations in the first half of the year  and a million increase in inventory resulting from lower than anticipated demand for our networking products and introduction of our new ultranet edge product 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock through our employee stock purchase plan provided cash in of million 
uses of cash in included million for the purchase of articulent and purchases of property and equipment and field support spares totaling million 
we also used  of cash in to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
in february  we sold million of convertible subordinated notes  raising net proceeds of million 
the proceeds from the offering will be used for general working capital purposes  including potential acquisitions 
expenditures for capital equipment and field support spares have been  and will likely continue to be  a significant capital requirement 
we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  when combined with anticipated cash flows from operations and proceeds from our recently completed convertible debenture offering will be adequate to fund our operating plans and meet our current anticipated aggregate capital requirements  at least through fiscal in april  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock
