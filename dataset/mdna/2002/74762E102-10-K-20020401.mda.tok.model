item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in item introduction we derive our revenues from one reportable segment by providing specialized contracting services and offering comprehensive network solutions 
our customers include electric power  gas  telecommunications and cable television companies  as well as commercial  industrial and governmental entities 
assuming all companies we acquired prior to december  had been acquired on january   we had pro forma combined revenues for the year ended december  of billion  of which was attributable to electric power and gas companies  was attributable to telecommunications customers  was attributable to cable television operators and was attributable to ancillary services  such as installing intelligent traffic networks  cable and control systems for light rail lines  airports and highways  and providing specialty rock trenching  directional boring and road milling for industrial and commercial customers 
we acquired nine companies in  three of which have continued as separate operating and reporting subsidiaries  or platform companies  while the remaining six acquired companies were tuck in acquisitions whose operating and accounting activities were absorbed into other operating subsidiaries 
we enter into contracts principally on the basis of competitive unit price or fixed price bids  the final terms and prices of which we frequently negotiate with the customer 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  most are made on either a unit price or fixed price basis in which we agree to do the work for a price per unit of work performed unit price or for a fixed amount for the entire project fixed price 
we also perform services on a cost plus or time and materials basis 
we complete most installation projects within one year  while we frequently provide maintenance and repair work under open ended  unit price master service agreements which are renewable annually 
we generally recognize revenue when services are performed except when work is being performed under fixed price contracts 
we typically record revenues from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
some of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds upon execution of the contract  depending upon the nature of the work to be performed 
our fixed price contracts often include payment provisions pursuant to which the customer withholds a to retainage from each progress payment and remits the retainage to us upon completion and approval of the work 
cost of services consists primarily of salaries  wages and benefits to employees  depreciation  fuel and other vehicle expenses  equipment rentals  subcontracted services  insurance  facilities expenses  materials and parts and supplies 
our gross margin  which is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues  is typically higher on projects where labor  rather than materials  constitutes a greater portion of the cost of services 
we can predict materials costs more accurately than labor costs 
therefore  to compensate for the potential variability of labor costs  we seek to maintain higher margins on labor intensive projects 
certain of our subsidiaries were previously subject to deductibles ranging from  to  for workers compensation insurance and  as of august   we have a deductible of  per occurrence related to workers compensation  employer s liability  automobile and general liability claims 
in addition  effective january   we consolidated the various non union employee related health care benefits plans that existed at certain of our subsidiaries into one corporate plan which is subject to a deductible of  per claimant per year 
fluctuations in insurance accruals related to these deductibles could have an impact on operating margins in the period in which such adjustments are made 
due in part to the events of september   the insurance market for large risks  including specialty service contractors  continues to experience increasing premiums 
this increased pricing pressure may cause us to increase our deductibles to defray certain of these costs 
we continue to build long term relationships with our insurance carriers to minimize such market swings 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management  administrative salaries and benefits  marketing  office rent and utilities  communications  professional fees and bad debt expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses can be impacted by our customers inability to pay for services performed 
through december   we have recorded goodwill of billion  which primarily equals the excess amount we have paid for businesses over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of such businesses acquired using the purchase method of accounting 
through december   we amortized this goodwill over its estimated useful life of years as a non cash charge to operating income 
we are unable to deduct the majority of amortized goodwill from our income for tax purposes 
seasonality  fluctuations of quarterly results our results of operations can be subject to seasonal variations 
during the winter months  demand for new projects and new maintenance service arrangements may be lower due to reduced construction activity 
however  demand for repair and maintenance services attributable to damage caused by inclement weather during the winter months may partially offset the loss of revenues from lower demand for new projects and new maintenance service arrangements 
additionally  our industry can be highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new projects in various geographic regions in the us typically  we experience lower gross and operating margins during the winter months 
the timing of acquisitions  variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter  the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs  regional economic conditions and our customer s access to capital may also materially affect quarterly results 
accordingly  our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and long term debt of million  net of current maturities 
our long term debt balance at that date included borrowings of million under our credit facility  million of senior secured notes  million of convertible subordinated notes and million of other debt 
during the year ended december   operating activities provided net cash to us of million 
operating cash flow before changes in working capital and other operating accounts totaled million 
net changes in working capital and other operating accounts generated million  net in  primarily as a result of management focus on working capital and a general business slowdown 
cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services  operating margins and the type of services we provide 
acquisitions created significant changes in our working capital accounts throughout the year and such accounts are not comparable to prior periods 
we used net cash in investing activities of million  including million used for the purchase of businesses  net of cash acquired and million used for additions of property and equipment 
financing activities provided net cash of million  resulting primarily from million in net borrowings under our credit facility and million from the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by million in net repayments of long term debt and million used for the purchase of treasury stock 
we currently have a million credit facility with participating banks 
the credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our operating subsidiaries and the majority of our assets 
we use the credit facility to provide funds to be used for working capital  to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a libor plus to  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facility or b the bank s prime rate plus up to  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda 
we pay commitment fees of to based on the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda on any unused borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
our subsidiaries guarantee repayment of all amounts due under the credit facility  and the credit facility restricts pledges of material assets 
we agreed to usual and customary covenants for a credit facility of this nature  including a prohibition on the payment of dividends on common stock  certain financial ratios and indebtedness covenants and a requirement to obtain the consent of the lenders for acquisitions exceeding a certain level of cash consideration 
as of march   we had borrowing availability of million under the credit facility 
the weighted average borrowing rate on the credit facility for the year ended december  was 
as of december   we had million of senior secured notes which have maturities ranging from four to nine years with a weighted average interest rate of and  pursuant to an intercreditor agreement  rank equally in right of repayment with indebtedness under our credit facility 
the senior secured notes have financial covenants similar to those under the credit facility 
as of december   we had million in convertible subordinated notes that bear interest at per year and are convertible into shares of our common stock at a price of per share  subject to adjustment as a result of certain events 
the convertible subordinated notes require semi annual interest payments until the notes mature on july  we have the option to redeem some or all of the convertible subordinated notes beginning july  at specified redemption prices  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
if certain fundamental changes occur  as described in the indenture under which we issued the convertible subordinated notes  holders of the convertible subordinated notes may require us to purchase all or part of their notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we have specifically provided for the possibility of a non cash goodwill impairment charge in our credit facility resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
and  accordingly  expect no impact on our credit facility as a result of this charge 
we are currently seeking to avoid any potential covenant violations through a similar amendment with holders of our senior secured notes and expect the completion of an amendment prior to the occurrence of any covenant violation 
a goodwill impairment charge will not violate any covenants in our convertible subordinated notes 
other commitments 
as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
our significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with non cancelable operating leases  letter of credit obligations and surety guarantees 
we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities 
we enter into non cancelable operating leases for many of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
we may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term 
typically we are liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
some customers require us to post letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts 
certain of our vendors also require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on behalf of us  such as to beneficiaries under our self funded insurance programs 
such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution 
the letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement 
to date we have not had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by the issuer of the letter of credit or by us and do not believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs 
to date  we have not had any significant reimbursements to our surety for bond related costs 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
the company s future contractual obligations  including interest under capital leases  are as follows in thousands less than total one year thereafter long term debt obligations including capital leases        operating lease obligations        the company also had million in letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility primarily to secure obligations under our casualty insurance program at year end 
while not actual borrowings  letters of credit do reflect potential liabilities under our credit facility and therefore are treated as a use of borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
these are irrevocable stand by letters of credit with maturities expiring at various times throughout upon maturity  it is expected that the majority of these letters of credit will be renewed for subsequent one year periods 
borrowing availability under our credit facility was million as of december  stock repurchase plan 
our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase plan under which up to million of our common stock may be repurchased 
under the stock repurchase plan  we may conduct purchases through open market transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws 
during  we purchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
the amount of shares purchased and the timing of any future purchases will be based on a number of factors  including the market price of the stock  market conditions and as our management deems appropriate 
stock employee compensation trust 
on march   our board of directors approved the creation of a sect to fund certain of our future employee benefit obligations using our common stock 
the sect was established by selling million shares of our common stock  including the  shares we purchased during pursuant to our stock repurchase plan  to the sect in exchange for a promissory note plus an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the shares 
the sect is a trust that holds shares of our common stock to be used to fund our obligations during the term of the trust in respect of certain benefit plans 
the sect will release the shares over years  the life of the trust  as the note is paid down through contributions by us to satisfy certain benefit requirements of our benefit plans 
in addition  we believe that the sect will reduce our cash obligations to fund these programs and provide us with a pre determined method to increase our equity base over time  which we believe will have a positive impact on our credit ratios 
we will recognize compensation expense for certain shares released based on the fair value of such shares as they are released from the sect 
unallocated shares held by the sect will not be included in calculating our earnings per share 
in all matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote or any tender offers made to our stockholders  the unallocated shares in the sect will be voted or tendered based on the direction of the participants in our broad based employee stock purchase plan 
litigation 
on november   aquila filed an arbitration demand against us with the kansas city  missouri office of the american arbitration association 
in its demand  aquila alleged that the amendment to our stockholder rights plan adopted by our board of directors on november   and subsequently ratified and reauthorized by a committee of our board of directors  violated the terms of our securities purchase agreement with aquila 
in its demand  aquila seeks i damages which may occur if the price of our shares rises during the period in which the rights plan amendment is in effect  ii a declaratory judgment that the rights plan amendment is void  and iii an order requiring us to take all necessary steps to amend our rights plan to allow aquila to acquire up to of our shares on a fully diluted basis without any economic penalty 
the arbitration proceeding is in the discovery stage and no prediction can be made as to the probable outcome of the proceeding at this time or as to the amount  if any  in damages we may be found to owe 
in addition  defense fees will be incurred associated with this case and other litigation with aquila and no prediction can be made as to the range of these fees 
in addition  we are from time to time a party to other litigation or administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we do not believe that any of these other proceedings  separately or in the aggregate would  in the opinion of management  be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
proxy solicitation 
on february   aquila announced its intention to conduct a proxy solicitation to replace members of our board of directors with a slate of its own nominees 
we intend to oppose the aquila proxy contest 
the proxy contest has resulted in  and will continue to result in  the incurrence of substantial fees and no prediction can be made as to the total amount of these fees 
change of control 
we entered into new employment agreements with certain employees  as of march   which become effective upon a change of control as defined in the new employment agreements of quanta 
the new employment agreements supplemented existing employment agreements already in effect 
the new employment agreements provide that  following a change of control  if we terminate the employee s employment without cause as defined in the new employment agreements  the employee terminates employment for good reason as defined in the new employment agreements  or the employee s employment terminates due to death or disability  we will pay certain amounts to the employee  which may vary with the level of the employee s responsibility and the terms of the employee s prior employment arrangements 
in addition  in the case of certain senior executives  these payments would also be due if the employee terminates his or her employment within the day window period commencing six months after the change in control 
in addition  an event of default could occur under our credit facility and senior secured notes in the event that aquila prevails in its recently announced proxy contest for control of our board of directors 
no such event of default provision exists under our convertible subordinated notes 
we cannot be certain that the affected lenders and note holders would waive such an event of default or that we or aquila would be able to refinance any defaulted indebtedness 
acquisitions 
during  we acquired nine companies for an aggregate consideration of million shares of common stock and million in cash 
the cash portion of such consideration was provided by proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for property and equipment for at least the next months 
however  if companies we wish to acquire are unwilling to accept our common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses  we could be required to utilize more cash to complete acquisitions 
if sufficient funds were not available from operating cash flow or through borrowings under the credit facility  we may be required to seek additional financing through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that we could secure such financing if and when we need it or on terms we would deem acceptable 
concentration of credit risk 
the company grants credit  generally without collateral  to its customers  which include electric power and gas companies  telecommunications and cable television system operators  governmental entities  general contractors  builders and owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the united states 
consequently  the company is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the united states 
however  the company generally is entitled to payment for work performed and has certain lien rights on that work and concentrations of credit risk are limited due to the diversity of the company s customer base 
further  management believes that its contract acceptance  billing and collection policies are adequate to minimize the potential credit risk 
no customer accounted for more than of accounts receivable or revenues as of or during the years ended december   or related party transactions 
in the normal course of business  we from time to time enter into transactions with related parties 
these transactions typically take the form of network service work for aquila or facility leases with prior owners 
see additional discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december   and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results 
significant balance sheet changes total assets increased approximately million in compared to this increase is primarily due to the following goodwill  net increased million resulting from acquisitions in property and equipment  net increased million due to expenditures for equipment necessary to perform contracts and equipment obtained through the acquisition of nine companies during other assets  net increased million due primarily to notes receivable from one of our customers 
we have agreed to long term payment terms while this customer is pursuing alternative financing 
the receivables are partially secured and bear interest at per year 
at december   the total amount due under this arrangement was million  with million classified as non current 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased million  primarily as a result of million of current deferred tax assets associated with various expenses that are not currently deductible 
the above increases were partially offset by decreased accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of million that resulted from a provision of million to allow for uncollectible receivables associated with the continued decline in the financial strength of certain customers in the telecommunications industry  continued emphasis on working capital management and lower levels of revenue during the fourth quarter of in  total liabilities increased approximately million and stockholders equity increased approximately million 
these increases were primarily due to the following stockholders equity increased million during this was primarily the result of the issuance of approximately million in shares of common stock for the acquisition of purchased companies  the issuance of approximately million in shares of common stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises  and net income of million 
these increases were partially offset by million of purchases of common stock under the stock repurchase plan 
deferred income taxes and other non current liabilities increased million due to an increase of million in deferred income tax liabilities resulting primarily from timing differences associated with property  equipment and goodwill and an increase of million in self insurance accruals related to claims that are not expected to be settled during results of operations the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of revenues for the years indicated dollars in thousands year ended december  revenues    cost of services including depreciation    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    merger and special charges   goodwill amortization    income from operations    interest expense    other income expense  net   income before income tax provision    provision for income taxes    net income    year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to strong growth in electric power and gas revenues as a result of increased outsourcing and deregulation  a full year of contributed revenues in for those companies acquired in and revenues of million from platform companies acquired in which continued to exist as separate reporting subsidiaries 
the increase was partially offset by decreased revenues from telecommunications customers due in part to the continued inability of certain of the customers to raise new capital and the overall downturn in the national economy 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million to million for the year ended december  gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin resulted from lower margins on work performed for telecommunications customers due to increased pricing pressures  lower asset utilization and the economic factors noted above  partially offset by higher margins received on work performed for the electric power and gas customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include million in charges consisting of a charge of million to provide allowances for accounts receivable risk associated with the continued decline in the financial strength of certain customers in the telecommunications industry  million in charges associated with the realignment of field personnel and discontinuance of negotiations regarding the acquisition of certain telecommunications contractors and million in costs associated with negotiations with aquila 
in addition  million of the increase was attributable to the platform companies we acquired subsequent to december  selling  general and administrative expenses also included a full period of costs in associated with those companies acquired during the remainder of the increase was attributable to tuck in acquisitions and the continued establishment of infrastructure to facilitate our growth and to integrate our acquired businesses

gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as a result of higher revenues 
gross margin decreased slightly from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decrease in gross margin resulted from lower margins on work performed for gas transmission and inside electrical customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to a full year of costs in associated with companies acquired in  million of additional selling  general and administrative expenses attributable to the platform companies we acquired in and the continued establishment of infrastructure to facilitate our growth and integrate our acquired businesses 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due to better absorption associated with a higher level of revenues

merger and special charges increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  in december  we agreed to conclude our obligations under the management services agreement with aquila in exchange for a one time payment to aquila of approximately million 
merger and special charges for the year ended december  included million of non cash compensation charges  which were related to the allocation of shares of common stock to participants in an employee stock ownership plan associated with one of the companies we acquired in a pooling transaction  and million of related excise tax charges 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   due to higher levels of debt resulting from the acquisitions of the companies we purchased in we also borrowed funds under our credit facility for equipment purchases and other operating activities to support higher levels of revenue 
in addition  interest expense increased due to higher interest rates under our credit facility during and from our issuance of the senior secured notes in march these increases were partially offset by lower interest rates on the convertible subordinated notes issued in july provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   with an effective tax rate of compared to million for the year ended december  and an effective tax rate of 
in  the provision reflected a portion of the merger and special charges for which no tax benefit had been provided

new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june   be accounted for using the purchase method 
the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be assessed at least annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
in addition  acquired intangible assets are required to be recognized and amortized over their useful lives if the benefit of the asset is based on contractual or legal rights 
while most provisions of sfas no 
are effective for the company beginning january   goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june   are subject immediately to the non amortization and amortization provisions of the statement  respectively 
at december   our net goodwill was billion and annual amortization of such goodwill was approximately million 
based on a preliminary review of the new standard  we believe that we will record a non cash goodwill impairment charge upon adoption and that the amount of such charge will be material in relation to our unamortized goodwill balance 
such charge  however  will not impact cash flow or operating income but will be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we have specifically provided for the possibility of a non cash goodwill impairment charge in our credit facility resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
 and accordingly  expect no impact on our credit facility as a result of this charge 
we are currently seeking to avoid any potential covenant violations through a similar amendment with holders of our senior secured notes and expect the completion of an amendment prior to the occurrence of any covenant violation 
a goodwill impairment charge will not violate any covenants in our convertible subordinated notes 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and establishes criteria for determining when a long lived asset is held for sale 
we are required to and will adopt sfas no 
on january   and believe that the adoption will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies  which are also described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and provision for doubtful accounts 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account receivable is considered doubtful 
inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgements and estimates including  among others  our customer s access to capital  our customer s willingness to pay  general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer 
goodwill 
as stated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements under new accounting pronouncements  fasb statement no 
provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
statement no 
also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment 
the statement requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions in order to allocate goodwill to reporting units and to determine the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  cost of capital and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets  as compared to our accounting policy for the assessment of goodwill impairment in  which was based on an undiscounted cash flow model 
revenue recognition 
we typically record revenues from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
changes in job performance  job conditions and final contract settlements  among others  are the factors that influence the assessment of the total estimated costs to complete these contracts 
self insurance 
we are insured for workers compensation  employer s liability  auto liability and general liability claims  subject to a deductible of  per accident or occurrence 
in addition  effective january   we consolidated the various non union employee related health care benefits plans that existed at certain of its subsidiaries into one corporate plan which is subject to a deductible of  per claimant per year 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate 
outlook the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
we expect continued growth and demand for our services from our utility and gas customers throughout we expect continued weakness in demand for our services from our telecommunications customers and relatively level demand for our services from our cable television and ancillary customers 
the economic conditions prevalent in impacted our ability to grow at historical levels and a continued economic downturn may lead to less demand for our services 
we intend to continue to emphasize internal growth  although we also plan to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions of profitable companies with strong management teams and good reputations to broaden our customer base  expand our geographic area of operation and grow our portfolio of services 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities  but we are not currently engaged in any negotiations to make any material acquisitions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates and  to a certain extent  commodity prices  as discussed below 
management does not generally use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
as of december   however  we had one derivative contract outstanding which related to anticipated exposure in the price of gas 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the derivative counterparty 
however  we monitor our derivative position by regularly evaluating our position and the credit worthiness of the counterparty  which we consider credit worthy at december  management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risk from the use of derivative financial instruments 
the sensitivity analyses below  which hypothetically illustrates our potential market risk exposure  estimates the effects of hypothetical sudden and sustained changes in the applicable market conditions on earnings 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider any additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions may be different from what actually occurs in the future 
interest rates 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
as such  we are exposed to earnings and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long term obligations 
as of december   approximately of our long term obligations were floating rate obligations 
as of december   the fair value of our variable rate debt of million approximated book value  and the fair value of our fixed rate debt of million was approximately million based upon discounted future cash flows using incremental borrowing rates and current market prices 
the detrimental effect on our pretax earnings of a hypothetical basis point increase in both variable and fixed interest rates would be approximately million and million  respectively 
commodity price exposure 
in october  we entered into a forward purchase contract with settlements through  in order to secure pricing on anticipated gas requirements related to a project in process at december  the objective is to mitigate the variability in the price of gas by fixing the price we will have to pay to our counterparty 
as of december   the fair value of this derivative was million and recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of march   we entered into a sub services agreement with our customer whereby the customer assumed all liabilities associated with this contract 
we had no derivative instruments outstanding as of or during the year ended december
