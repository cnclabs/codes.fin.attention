under the agreement  the company has the option to elect to have interest rates determined based upon the prime rate at pnc bank na plus margin or a libor rate plus margin 
a commitment fee is payable on the unused amount of credit 
the agreement requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants 
the company is in compliance with the covenants of the agreement 
at july   approximately  of the line of credit was available to the company under the formulas contained in the agreement 
the agreement requires that the company maintain a specified level of ii consolidated net worth  which could restrict the company s ability to pay dividends 
at july   the required consolidated net worth was approximately  and the company s actual consolidated net worth on that date was approximately  at july  and  there were no borrowings under this line of credit 
long term obligations as a percentage of long term obligations plus stockholders investment were at july  and at july  and the company continues to seek opportunities to invest in new products  new markets and strategic acquisitions and joint ventures  which fit its growth strategy 
management believes the company s cash and cash equivalents  available line of credit  and the cash flow it generates from operating activities are adequate to meet the company s current investing and financing needs 
the company does not have material off balance sheet arrangements or related party transactions 
the company is not aware of factors that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity trends  other than the risk factors presented in other company filings 
however  the following additional information is provided to assist financial statement users 
operating leases these leases generally are entered into only for non strategic investments eg  warehouses  office buildings  computer equipment where the economic profile is favorable 
purchase commitments the company has purchase commitments for materials  supplies  services  and property  plant and equipment as part of the ordinary conduct of business 
in the aggregate  such commitments are not in excess of current market prices 
due to the proprietary nature of many of the company s materials and processes  certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination 
the company does not believe a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations 
other contractual obligations the company does not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity 
related party transactions the company does not have any related party transactions that materially affect the results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
the company s future commitments at july  for long term debt and capital lease obligations  and operating lease obligations are as follows dollars in thousands long term debt year ending july  capital leases operating leases total thereafter    total    inflation essentially all of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of its products in competitive markets 
because prices are influenced by market conditions  it is not always possible to fully recover cost increases through pricing 
changes in product mix from year to year and timing differences in instituting price changes make it virtually impossible to accurately define the impact of inflation on profit margins 
ii euro conversion on january   the euro was adopted as the national currency of european union member nations 
during a three year transition period  the euro has been used as a non cash transactional currency 
the company began conducting business in euros in january  and has changed its functional currencies during the three year transition period 
the conversion to the euro did not have a significant operational impact or a material impact on the results of operations  cash flows or financial condition of the company 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of goods to customers 
the vast majority of the company s revenue relates to sale of inventory to customers  and revenue is recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer 
given the nature of the company s business and the applicable rules guiding revenue recognition  the company s revenue recognition practices do not contain estimates that materially affect results of operations 
restructuring restructuring charges relate to the restructurings in fiscal and the company provides forward looking information about the restructuring activities  including estimated costs and savings 
such disclosures represent management s best estimate  but do require significant estimates that may change over time 
however  the specific reserves recorded in each year under the restructuring activities are not considered highly uncertain  as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
changes in existing regulatory tax laws and rates may affect the company s ability to successfully manage regulatory matters around the world  and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
the company s accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
although certain changes cannot be reasonably assumed in the company s current estimates  management does not believe such changes would result in a material period to period impact on the results of operations or financial condition 
purchase price allocation the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and application of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for allocation purposes 
if the actual results differ from the ii estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration in the amortization expense 
in addition  fas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment 
changes in management estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
new accounting standards as of august   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for the acquisition of intangible assets outside of a business combination and for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this accounting standard requires that goodwill be separately disclosed from other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet  and no longer be amortized  but tested for impairment on at least a periodic basis 
the company performed the transitional assessment of goodwill on august  and the annual assessment on may  the assessments included comparing the carrying amount of net assets  including goodwill  of each reporting unit to their respective fair value as of the date of the assessment 
fair value was estimated based upon discounted cash flow analyses 
because the estimated fair value of each of the company s reporting units exceeded their carrying amount  management believes that no impairment existed as of the date of the latest assessment 
no indications of impairment have been identified between the date of the latest assessment and july  in accordance with sfas no 
 the company discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective august  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company adopted both sfas no 
and sfas no 
in august the company does not expect the statements to have a material impact on its financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this pronouncement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   and requires these costs to be recognized when the liability is incurred and not at project initiation 
the company is reviewing the provisions of this statement  but does not expect it to have a material impact on its financial statements 
forward looking statements except for historical information  the company s reports to the securities and exchange commission on form k and form q and periodic press releases  as well as other public documents and statements  may contain forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are often identified by words such as intend  anticipate  assume  believe  estimate  expect  plan  project  will  and other expressions  which refer to future events and trends 
the ability of the company to attain management s goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors  including those set forth herein 
economic conditions operating results are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and growth or contraction of the principal economies in which we operate  including the united states  canada  europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
this is especially true with respect to growth or contraction of the industrial and technology sectors of those economies 
all economies in which we operate are cyclical ii and the rates of growth or contraction can vary substantially 
because we have few long term contracts  we generally ship products within a short period of time from receiving orders and thus maintain only a small backlog 
the extent to which we can rapidly adjust our cost structure and output to changing economic conditions may have a significant effect on our future profitability 
currency fluctuations approximately half of our sales are in foreign currencies  which fluctuate in relationship to one another and to the united states dollar 
fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction  translation and other losses 
these fluctuations can have an adverse effect on our reported sales and earnings 
cost of raw materials as a manufacturer  our sales and profitability are also dependent upon availability and cost of raw materials and the ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor 
inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials and labor have occurred in the past and are expected to recur 
our ability to reflect these costs in increased selling prices for our products  increasing our productivity  and focusing on higher profit businesses  will significantly influence our ability to maintain our margins 
past performance may or may not be replicable in the future 
reliance on suppliers our manufacturing operations depend on our suppliers ability to deliver quality components and products in time for us to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules 
if shortages or delays occur  our operating results could suffer until other sources can be developed 
new products a significant portion of the revenues in each of our recent fiscal years has been represented by sales of products we have introduced within three years prior to the period 
our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop  acquire and retain necessary intellectual property rights is therefore essential to maintaining our growth  which ability cannot be assured 
acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures part of our historic growth has come through acquisitions 
we may also engage in strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
our ability to effectively evaluate potential acquisition  strategic alliance  joint venture or divestiture transactions and to effectuate such transactions at a reasonable price can affect our profitability 
in addition  acquisitions  strategic alliances and joint ventures may require us to integrate with a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may also have to develop  manufacture and market products with our products in a way that enhances the performance of the combined business or product line 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including the hiring and retention of key employees  management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  the integration or coordination of different research and development and product manufacturing facilities  and systems integration and implementation 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
intellectual property we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the us and in certain other countries  and agreements with our employees and customers to establish and maintain our property rights in our technology and products 
however  any of our intellectual property rights could be ii challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property 
even if we do not believe that our products are infringing third parties intellectual property rights  the claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology or substitute similar technology from another source  our business could suffer 
environmental some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal  state and foreign laws governing the environment 
it is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites inside and outside the us  even when not subject to local government regulations 
however  a failure to comply with applicable standards or the accidental emission of or exposure to hazardous materials could give rise to significant monetary liability 
also  the imposition of new governmental standards or requirements could materially increase our cost of operation 
effect of international political considerations our international operations may be significantly influenced by political  economic and regulatory conditions including tariffs in the countries in which we conduct our operations 
other other factors include costs and other effects of interest rate increases  legal and administrative cases and proceedings  settlements  judgments and investigations  claims  and changes in those items  adoption of new  or revised accounting policies and practices and the application of such policies and practices  the successful implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system  business reorganizations or combinations  loss of significant contract or customer  the euro conversion  the ability and willingness of purchasers to substitute other products for the products that we distribute  and pricing  purchasing  financing and promotional decisions by intermediaries in the distribution channel 
the factors identified in this statement are believed to be important factors but not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be expressed or implied in any forward looking statement made by  or on behalf of  the company 
other factors not discussed in this statement could also have material adverse effects concerning forward looking objectives or estimates 
the company assumes no obligation to update the information included in this statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
to manage that risk effectively  the company enters into hedging transactions  according to established guidelines and policies  that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of this financial market risk 
the global nature of the company s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets 
as a result of investments  production facilities and other operations on a global scale  the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary objective of the company s foreign exchange risk management is to minimize the impact of currency movements on intercompany transactions and foreign raw material imports 
to achieve this objective  the company hedges a portion of known exposures using forward contracts 
main exposures are related to transactions denominated in the british pound  the euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen and australian dollar 
the risk of these hedging instruments is not material 
the company could be exposed to interest rate risk through its corporate borrowing activities 
the objective of the company s interest rate risk management activities is to manage the levels of the company s fixed and floating interest rate exposure to be consistent with the company s preferred mix 
the interest rate risk management program consists of entering into approved interest rate derivatives when there is a desire to modify the company s exposure to interest rates 
as of july   the company has not entered into any interest rate derivatives
