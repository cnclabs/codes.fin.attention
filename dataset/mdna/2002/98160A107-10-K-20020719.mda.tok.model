item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and other financial information appearing elsewhere herein 
the company s revenues are generated from four primary sources domestic company operated sizzler restaurant sales and franchise revenues including franchise fees  royalties and rental income  international company operated sizzler restaurant sales and franchise revenues  revenues from international kfc franchises operated by the company and domestic company operated pat oscar s sm restaurants 
during fiscal year  the company opened four new pat oscar s sm locations  including its first in san bernardino county  california and now operates in three counties in california and one in arizona 
the company plans to open five to six restaurants in fiscal year  including one or two locations in los angeles county  california 
the company continued its focus on providing high quality food in a fast casual setting served by employees who are trained in a culture that emphasizes cheerful service and the value of its employees and guests 
during fiscal year  following the prior year enhancement of a majority of its company owned sizzler restaurants with an interior remodel and menu upgrade  the company concentrated on strengthening its operations through re training its restaurant employees and by obtaining guest feedback from a variety of sources including focus groups  secret shoppers and employees 
near the end of fiscal year  the company began testing an updated exterior fa ade at one of its restaurants and expects to expand the test  if successful  to ten locations during fiscal year in addition to the company store remodels  the company has continued the franchise reinvestment program whereby its franchisees are implementing the d cor and menu upgrades implemented by the company 
during the fiscal year  the company s franchisees completed four full restaurant remodels and partial remodels 
during fiscal year  the company s international division continued testing the sizzler remodel design that incorporates features from the us sizzler remodels as well as local preferences 
the company is presently testing two remodel formats  one mirrors the us sizzler version and the other is a scaled back version of its theme 
the company will continue to monitor these locations before proceeding with the remodel program in australia 
the company has also continued its facilities upgrade program for its kfc locations and has introduced face to face drive through window operations in locations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of asset  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to its most critical accounting policies  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our franchisees to make required payments for franchise royalties  rents and notes receivable 
in assessing the recoverability of these receivables  the company makes assumptions regarding the financial condition of its franchisees based primarily on past payment trends and periodic financial information  which the franchisees are required to submit 
if the financial condition of its franchisees were to deteriorate and result in their inability to make payments  the company may be required to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts by recording additional bad debt expense 
property and equipment the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers a history of operating losses to be its primary indicator of potential impairment 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the company deems an asset to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted projected future operating cash flows directly related to the asset  including disposal value  if any  is less than its carrying amount 
projected future operating cashflows are based on budgeted future operational results 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate projected future operating cashflows 
accordingly  if actual results vary from such estimates  significant future impairments could result 
intangible assets the company is required to review its intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis 
the company has established its reporting units based on its current reporting structure and all recognized assets  liabilities and goodwill have been assigned to these reporting units 
fair value for goodwill is determined based on fair market valuation of the reporting unit 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair market value 
accordingly  actual results could vary from such estimates 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years for the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of enactment 
the company regularly reviews its deferred income tax assets to determine the realizability of the deferred income tax assets based on the weight of available information 
realization of the net deferred income tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the periods in which temporary differences will reverse 
the amount of the net deferred income tax asset that is considered realizable  however  could be adjusted in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are adjusted 
self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of its workers compensation  general liability and health insurance plans 
the full extent of certain claims  in many cases  may not become fully determined for several years 
the company  therefore  estimates the potential obligation for liabilities which have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data and experience  and utilizes an outside consulting firm to assist the company in developing these estimates 
although management believes that the amounts accrued for these obligations are sufficient  any significant increase in either the number of claims and or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
supplemental executive retirement plan the company terminated its supplemental executive retirement plan serp but continues to remain obligated under the serp for former employees including an employee who retired in fiscal the company accounts for the serp under sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
the company makes significant assumptions used in determining the net pension cost and benefit obligation 
significant assumptions used are discount rates and mortality tables  which are determined with assistance of an outside consulting firm 
although management believes that the amounts accrued for these benefit obligations are sufficient  any changes in these assumptions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the following market risks interest rate risk  foreign currency rate risk  and commodity price risk 
interest rate risk the company s primary financial instrument subject to interest rate risk is a bank loan with an outstanding principal balance of million or million australian dollars at april  the loan is payable in australian dollars and is collateralized by the principal operating assets  undertakings  intellectual property  unlimited cross guarantees and certain negative pledge agreements of the company s international division 
the loan bears variable interest at a rate equal to the australian inter bank borrowing rate percent at april   plus a margin of percent 
the primary exposure relating to this financial instrument results from changes in interest rates 
to limit the company s exposure to interest rate increases  the company entered into two interest rate cap contracts  which prevent the company s interest rate from exceeding a weighted average interest rate of approximately percent  in which case the company would receive the difference between the contract rate and the actual interest rate 
interest rate caps in place cover approximately percent of the loan principal outstanding and expire september  and august   respectively 
in addition  the company has entered into two interest rate swap contracts to convert part of its variable interest rate exposure to a fixed rate of approximately percent 
interest rate swap contracts in place as of the end of the fiscal year covered approximately percent of the loan principal outstanding and expire september  and august   respectively 
the company also has a revolving credit facility and a term loan in the amount of million with variable interest as a result of the acquisition of pat oscar s 
the interest rates ranged from to percent during fiscal year the company calculated that a hypothetical percent change in the interest rates  as defined above  in the near term would result in approximately a  change in interest expense for the company s variable rate debt noted above
