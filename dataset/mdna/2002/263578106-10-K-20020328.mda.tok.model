item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the following should be read in connection with all consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this report 
general nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we generate revenues primarily through sales of over the counter and prescription pharmaceutical products  health and beauty care products  food and beverage items  tobacco products  cosmetics  housewares  hosiery  greeting cards  photofinishing  photo supplies and seasonal merchandise 
health and beauty care products  including over the counter drugs  represent our highest volume product categories 
our primary costs and expenses are nbsp  inventory costs  nbsp  labor expenses and nbsp  occupancy costs 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we achieved sales per square foot of in fiscal and in fiscal we believe that sales per square foot is a useful measure of comparing our performance to that of our competitors because it is a measure of a store s sales productivity 
we currently expect that our sales per square foot may decline as we continue with our plan to increase new store openings during fiscal the opening of these additional stores may result in a decline in sales per square foot principally because nbsp  the average square footage for new stores will often be greater than that of the existing store base and nbsp  new stores generally take some time to reach a mature level of sales 
we believe that our competitors in the industry experience increases and decreases in sales per square foot for similar reasons 
over the next two years  we plan to open to stores  of which approximately two thirds will be located outside of manhattan 
there are no future plans for any significant number of store closings 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our primary assets are our ownership of of the outstanding partnership interest of duane reade  a new york general partnership  and ownership of all of the outstanding common stock of dri nbsp  i nbsp  inc dri nbsp  i nbsp  inc 
owns the remaining partnership interest in duane reade 
substantially all of our operations are conducted through duane reade 
in august nbsp  we established two new subsidiaries  duane reade international and duane reade realty 
duane reade distributed to duane reade nbsp  inc and dri i nbsp  inc 
all rights  title  and interest in all its trademarks  trade names and all other intellectual property rights 
in turn  duane reade nbsp  inc and dri i nbsp  inc 
made a capital contribution of these intellectual property rights to duane reade international 
this change created a controlled system to manage and exploit these intellectual property rights separate and apart from the retail operations 
in addition  duane reade distributed some of its store leases to duane reade nbsp  inc and dri i nbsp  inc  which in turn made a capital contribution of these leases to duane reade realty 
duane reade realty is the lessee under certain store leases entered into after its creation 
duane reade realty subleases to duane reade the properties subject to those leases 
the consolidated financial statements included herein reflect the accounts of duane reade inc and its subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
results of operations nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  on september nbsp   a terrorist attack on the world trade center complex in downtown manhattan resulted in the total destruction of that landmark and significant disruption of commerce throughout the entire city  within which most of our stores are located 
the attack resulted in the complete loss of two stores  one of which was in the top tier of our stores based on sales volume and profit contribution 
also  as a result of this disaster and the related disruptions within our market in the period following the disaster  we reported significant declines in sales and earnings growth trends from the levels achieved prior to the disaster 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  over the weeks in subsequent to the disaster  we estimate lost sales of approximately nbsp  million  primarily in higher margin front end sales  and reduced net earnings of approximately nbsp  million  or per diluted share 
we are insured for our property losses  extra costs to re establish operations and business interruption losses 
to date  we have collected nbsp  million in insurance recoveries for our property losses  of which nbsp  million was received subsequent to the december nbsp  nbsp  year end 
the results discussed below include all business interruption losses incurred over the period subsequent to the disaster with no provision for insurance recoveries other than the cost of our physical property losses and covered extra expenses to re establish operations 
we have submitted our business interruption claim  which is material in amount  to the insurance carrier  and we expect the required adjusting process for the settlement of this claim to continue well into the second half of this year 
specific areas of our reported results materially impacted by this disaster are included in our management discussion and analysis of financial condition provided below 
a name page bm nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the following sets forth the results of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net sales nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  cost of sales nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  gross profit nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  selling  general amp  administrative expenses nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  depreciation and amortization nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  store pre opening expenses nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  operating income nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net interest expense nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  income before income taxes nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  income tax benefit expense nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  income before extraordinary charge nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  extraordinary charge nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net income loss nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  fiscal compared to fiscal nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net sales in the week year ended december nbsp  were nbsp  billion  an increase of over the week year ended december nbsp  sales of nbsp  billion 
on a comparable week basis  net sales in increased over the same period in the increases were due to increased comparable store sales of and the inclusion of stores opened during for the entire period and net new stores opened in the increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to improved pharmacy sales  which increased to of total sales in compared to of total sales in pharmacy sales have followed the general industry trend reflecting accelerated growth rates versus front end sales 
pharmacy and front end comparable sales increased by and  respectively 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for from for  resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to for from for cost of goods sold in includes two unusual items  a loss of nbsp  million from the early termination of a supply agreement and a gain of nbsp  million from the sale of a few stores customer lists 
the combined net loss of nbsp  million for these unusual items represented of sales in the balance of the gross margin decline primarily resulted from the low front end comparable store growth rate of and the faster growth rate of lower margin pharmacy sales 
the low growth rate in comparable front end sales for the year was primarily attributable to the impact of customer disruptions in the aftermath of the world trade center disaster  the recessionary economy in the second half of the year and a mild flu season in the fourth quarter that depressed sales of cough and cold categories 
lower margin pharmacy sales benefited in the fourth quarter from increased demand for ciprofloxacin as a result of anthrax scares  as well as higher rates of sales in certain sleep aids and anti depressants 
gross profit was also adversely impacted by the loss of front end sales related allowances in the period following the world trade center disaster 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  selling  general and administrative expenses were nbsp  million  or of net sales  and nbsp  million  or of net sales  in and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of sales reflects improved efficiencies and additional expense leveraging against new store sales  as well as a reduction in earnings based incentive compensation and benefit costs 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  depreciation and amortization of intangibles in and was nbsp  million and nbsp  million  respectively 
the increase was attributable to capital spending for property and equipment during and  primarily in support of new store growth as well as amortization expenses for goodwill  pharmacy customer lists and lease acquisition costs for acquisitions completed during and nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  store pre opening expenses of nbsp  million related to the opening of stores in as compared to nbsp  million reflecting store openings in nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net interest expense decreased to nbsp  million in from nbsp  million in the decrease in interest expense was principally due to the nbsp  million of proceeds from the june  nbsp  equity offering that were used to reduce term loan and revolver borrowings and lower interest rates on the floating rate portion of our revolving credit facility during  as well as one less week in fiscal as compared to fiscal this was partially offset by increased revolver borrowings attributable to the lost sales and earnings in the aftermath of the world trade center disaster 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our income before income taxes increased to nbsp  million in from nbsp  million in nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  during  we recorded an income tax provision of nbsp  million  reflecting an effective tax rate of  reduced by certain wage related income tax credits amounting to nbsp  million 
during  we recorded an income tax provision of nbsp  million  reflecting an effective tax rate of  reduced by wage related income tax credits totaling nbsp  million 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net income was nbsp  million in and nbsp  million in the increase of nbsp  million is a result of the increase in pre tax income of nbsp  million in versus  partially offset by the incremental income tax provision of nbsp  million and the after tax extraordinary charge of nbsp  million in  reflecting the write off of deferred financing costs as a result of the june  early retirement of debt 
fiscal compared to fiscal nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net sales in the week year ended december nbsp  were nbsp  billion  an increase of over the week year ended december nbsp  sales of nbsp  million 
on a comparable week basis  net sales in increased over the same period in the increase was due to increased comparable store sales of and the inclusion of stores opened during for the entire period and net new stores opened in the increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to improved pharmacy sales  which increased to of total sales in compared to of total sales in pharmacy sales have followed the general industry trend reflecting accelerated growth rates versus front end sales 
pharmacy and front end comparable sales increased by and  respectively 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for from for  resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to for from for the decrease in gross margin resulted principally from the faster growth rate of lower margin pharmacy sales and the inclusion of the rd week in  which included a significant portion of post holiday markdowns not included in the previous week year 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  selling  general and administrative expenses were nbsp  million  or of net sales  and nbsp  million  or of net sales  in and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of sales reflects the favorable leveraging of store operating costs from maturing retail sites  as well as the leveraging of general and administrative expenses against new and comparative store sales growth 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  depreciation and amortization of intangibles in and was nbsp  million and nbsp  million  respectively 
the increase was attributable to capital spending for property and equipment during and as well as amortization expenses for goodwill  pharmacy customer lists and lease acquisition costs for acquisitions completed during and this was partially offset by reduced amortization expenses related to a nbsp  million reduction of goodwill in the fourth quarter of  and a change in the estimated useful life of pharmacy customer list acquisitions from to nbsp  years 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  store pre opening expenses of nbsp  million related to the opening of stores in as compared to nbsp  million reflecting store openings in nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net interest expense increased to nbsp  million in from nbsp  million in the increase in interest expense was principally due to higher levels of average borrowings and higher interest rates during nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our income before income taxes increased to nbsp  million in from nbsp  million in nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  during  we recorded an income tax provision of nbsp  million  reflecting an effective tax rate of  partially offset by certain wage related income tax credits 
during  we recorded an income tax benefit of nbsp  million due to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation reserves of nbsp  million 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we recorded net income of nbsp  million in  compared to net income of nbsp  million in the decrease of nbsp  million is a result of the income tax benefit of nbsp  million recorded in as compared to the income tax provision of nbsp  million recorded in  partially offset by the increase in pre tax income of nbsp  million in versus liquidity and capital resources nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  on june nbsp   we successfully completed a follow on equity offering the offering of  shares of common stock  including  primary shares and  secondary shares from selling stockholders 
the primary shares were sold for net proceeds of per share that resulted in nbsp  million in proceeds to us after deducting various expenses related to the offering 
we also received nbsp  million from the exercise of certain selling shareholders stock options in connection with the sale of the secondary shares 
these proceeds were used to reduce term loan and revolver borrowings  resulting in a reduction of debt at june nbsp  from nbsp  million to nbsp  million 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in connection with the completed equity offering  on july nbsp   we entered into the fourth amended and restated credit agreement the restated credit agreement 
the restated credit agreement resulted in a refinancing of our outstanding term b and term c loans into a new term b loan with reduced libor margins and an extended maturity date 
the restated credit agreement was made possible as a result of the completed offering and related improvement in our leverage ratios 
as of december nbsp   the outstanding balances of the term a and term b loans were nbsp  million and nbsp  million  respectively 
the libor margin on the new term b loan was reduced to from on the term b and term c loans in effect prior to the refinancing 
additionally  the restated credit agreement provides for an increase in permitted revolver borrowings from nbsp  million to nbsp  million of which nbsp  million was made available as of the date of the refinancing 
at december nbsp   there was nbsp  million of outstanding revolver borrowings and nbsp  million of standby letters of credit  leaving nbsp  million of availability 
annual permitted capital expenditures were increased from to nbsp  million in this restated credit agreement  and certain restrictive covenants were modified to provide us with additional flexibility 
our revolver and term nbsp  a loans under our restated credit agreement expire on february nbsp   and our term nbsp  b loan expires on february nbsp  we expect to be able to replace the revolving and term nbsp  a portions of our restated credit agreement under terms that are approximately equivalent to those currently in effect 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  working capital was nbsp  million as of december nbsp  and nbsp  million as of december nbsp  the increase of nbsp  million was primarily due to inventory and accounts receivable increases of nbsp  million and nbsp  million respectively 
the inventory increase resulted from purchases of inventory required to support the opening of additional stores during  as well as increases in owned pharmacy inventory above a consignment limit of nbsp  million  under the agreement with our primary pharmacy supplier 
increased inventory also related to earlier purchases of spring holiday merchandise in advance of an earlier easter holiday in the increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to significantly higher sales volumes of third party reimbursed prescriptions that is consistent with the general industry trend 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our ebitda increased by nbsp  million  or  to nbsp  million in compared to nbsp  million in ebitda as a percentage of sales was in  compared to in the reduced ebitda margin was primarily attributable to lower gross profit margins as discussed above 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was nbsp  million  compared to nbsp  million for fiscal the primary reason for the increase was increased cash earnings partially offset by increases in working capital related to inventory for new stores and increased accounts receivable 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was nbsp  million  compared to nbsp  million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in was for capital expenditures of nbsp  million  primarily related to the opening and remodeling of new and renovated stores  combined with nbsp  million for lease  pharmacy file and other acquisition costs  partially offset by nbsp  million of proceeds generated by the sale of certain stores customer files 
net cash used in investing activities in was due to capital expenditures of nbsp  million and nbsp  million for lease  pharmacy file and other acquisition costs 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was nbsp  million  compared to nbsp  million in fiscal the higher levels of cash provided by financing activities in resulted from increased capital expenditures to support increased levels of new store growth and higher levels of cash spending for lease  pharmacy file and other acquisition costs 
proceeds of nbsp  million from the june  common stock offering were used to repay a portion of our outstanding senior debt 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our capital requirements primarily result from opening and stocking new stores  remodeling and renovating existing retail locations and from the continuing development of management information systems 
we believe that there are significant opportunities to open additional stores  and currently plan to open approximately to stores during the next two years 
we expect to spend approximately nbsp  million in fiscal on capital expenditures  primarily for new and replacement stores and an additional nbsp  million for lease and pharmacy file acquisition and other costs 
we also require working capital to support inventory for our existing stores 
historically  we have been able to lease our store locations 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  leases for of our stores that generated approximately of our net sales for fiscal are scheduled to expire before the end of fiscal four of these leases have renewal options 
we believe that we will be able to renew the other expiring leases on economically favorable terms or  alternatively  find other economically attractive locations to lease 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   approximately  of our approximately  employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreements covering these employees  we are required  in some instances  to pay specified annual increases in salary and benefits contributions relating to the member employees 
we do not believe that these increases will have a material impact on our liquidity or results of operations 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we believe that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under our credit agreement  will be adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to comply with the terms of our debt agreements 
as of december nbsp   we had borrowed nbsp  million under the revolving portion of our restated credit agreement and had approximately nbsp  million of remaining availability 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future 
substantially all of our borrowings under the restated credit agreement bear interest at floating rates 
therefore  our financial condition will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  at december nbsp   there were nbsp  million of receivables related to recoverable property losses and extra costs to reopen stores that were temporarily closed due to the disruptions related to the september nbsp  world trade center disaster 
we have received nbsp  million in insurance proceeds subsequent to the balance sheet date that represents partial payment for these losses and we expect to receive the balance within the first half of the current year 
we have also submitted our business interruption claim  which is material in amount  and expect that the required process of adjusting this claim will continue into the second half of this year 
the above liquidity assessment does not assume any additional insurance recoveries above those already collected to date 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the restated credit agreement contains various covenants that limit or restrict  among other things  subject to certain exceptions  capital expenditures  the incurrence of indebtedness  the creation of liens  transactions with affiliates  restricted payments  investments and acquisitions  mergers  consolidations  dissolutions  asset sales  dividends  distributions and certain other transactions and business activities 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  financial performance covenants include interest coverage  leverage ratios  minimum net worth requirements and fixed charge coverage 
at december nbsp   we were in compliance with all financial performance covenants 
there are no credit ratings related triggers in our restated credit agreement or in the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes due the senior note indenture that would impact cost of borrowing  annual amortization of principal or related debt maturities 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  on december nbsp   we entered into a two year interest rate swap in the notional amount of nbsp  million 
this swap had an effective date of january nbsp  and represented a hedging transaction whereby we would receive interest at a floating rate and pay interest at a fixed libor rate 
the effect of this swap is to fix our interest obligations on nbsp  million of floating rate debt for two years at a libor rate of plus the applicable margins as defined in the credit agreement see note nbsp  to the consolidated financial statements 
this agreement expires on january nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the following table provides additional information with respect to our commitments and obligations payments due by period contractual cash obligations nbsp  total nbsp  within year nbsp  years nbsp  years nbsp  after years nbsp  nbsp  dollars in thousands long term debt nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  capital lease obligations nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  operating leases nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  total contractual cash obligations nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  at december   this represented the outstanding balance of term loans million and revolving credit borrowings million under our restated credit agreement  combined with the outstanding balance of our senior subordinated notes due million  as further detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements

the largest of these is with amerisourcebergen  the company s primary pharmaceutical supplier 
generally  these agreements provide for certain volume commitments and are terminable by us  subject in some cases to specified termination payments  none of which would constitute a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
it is the opinion of management that if any of these agreements were terminated or if any contracting party was to experience events precluding fulfillment of its obligations  we would be able to find a suitable alternative supplier 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we are not a party to any agreements with  or commitments to  any special purpose entities that would constitute material off balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments listed above 
critical accounting policies nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our discussion of results of operations and financial condition relies on our consolidated financial statements that are prepared based on certain critical accounting policies that require management to make judgements and estimates that are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty 
we believe that investors need to be aware of these policies and how they impact our financial reporting to gain a more complete understanding of our consolidated financial statements as a whole  as well as our related discussion and analysis presented herein 
while we believe that these accounting policies are grounded on sound measurement criteria  actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from these estimates or forecasts 
the accounting policies and related risks described in the paragraphs below are those that depend most heavily on these judgements and estimates 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size pharmacy receivables  reserves for uncollectible accounts  at december nbsp   accounts receivable included nbsp  million of amounts due from various insurance companies and governmental agencies under third party payment plans for prescription sales made prior to the year end date 
our accounting policy is to fully reserve for all unpaid pharmacy receivables over nbsp  days old  as well as any others deemed potentially uncollectible 
this policy is based on our past collection experience 
our uncollectible pharmacy receivable losses amounted to nbsp  million in fiscal and there was approximately nbsp  million reserved for uncollectible pharmacy receivables at december nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size inventory shrink estimates  we take front end physical inventories in each of our stores and the distribution center twice per year on a staggered cycle basis 
front end inventories at balance sheet dates are valued using the retail dollar based first in  first out fifo method reduced by estimated inventory shrink losses for the period between the last physical inventory in each store and the balance sheet date 
these shrink estimates are based on the latest chain wide trends 
at december nbsp   an understatement of this shrink estimate by of front end sales would result in a reduction in current year pre tax earnings of approximately nbsp  million 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size insurance liabilities and reserves  at december nbsp   there were nbsp  million of accrued general liability claim costs that primarily related to our self insured portion of customer accident claims 
our policy is to recognize a liability for the estimated self insured portion of the projected ultimate settlement value of these claims as well as a provision for incurred but unreported claims as of each balance sheet date 
these estimates are made based on a review of the facts and circumstances of each individual claim using experienced third party claims adjustors 
these estimates are also reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis by management 
although the maximum self insured portion of any individual claim amounts to  our historical claim settlement experience is significantly lower 
at december nbsp   there were outstanding claims with an average projected settlement value of approximately  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  at december nbsp   goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  amounted to approximately nbsp  million 
other net intangible assets consisted of lease acquisition costs of nbsp  million  customer lists of nbsp  million and non compete agreements amounting to nbsp  million 
our policy is to evaluate these acquired assets for impairment as of each balance sheet date by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows from the underlying stores or assets over their remaining asset lives to the net intangible asset values 
any intangible asset for which the projected undiscounted cash flow is insufficient to recover the asset s carrying value is considered impaired and would be written down to its net recoverable value 
such write downs would result in a non cash charge to earnings 
the september nbsp  terrorist attack on the world trade center had a significant adverse impact upon our third and fourth quarter s earnings  gross margins and cash flow 
despite this impact  there were no goodwill or intangible asset impairments in our december nbsp  evaluation 
the projected future cash flows used in this evaluation reflected a gradual improvement in our sales  margins and cash flows during the current year as the rebuilding process in new york city expands in scope 
the average period of cash flow recovery determined in this test was within nbsp  years  and all stores are projected to recover their intangible asset values within their useful lives 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size other loss contingencies  liabilities for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
loss contingencies often take years to resolve and can involve complicated litigation matters and potential regulatory actions  the outcomes of which are difficult to predict 
at december nbsp   there were no loss contingency liabilities that we considered probable and reasonably estimable 
accounting change nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  during the first quarter of  we plan to adopt a change in accounting method to convert from our current retail dollar based first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation to an item specific cost based last in  first out lifo method of inventory valuation 
this change is expected to result in a separate one time non cash after tax charge of approximately nbsp  million to be recorded in the first quarter 
in addition  expected inflation in inventory acquisition costs will likely result in increased charges to cost of goods to be sold during we estimate that a inflation in the annual inventory acquisition costs in would approximate a nbsp  million reduction in fiscal net earnings 
adoption of the specific cost lifo method will result in the recognition of the latest item costs in our reported gross margins  and will make our results more comparable to other major retailers in our industry 
in an inflationary period  the lifo method also has the added favorable impact of increasing cash flow through reduced income taxes 
seasonality nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the non pharmacy business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas holiday season generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other periods 
see note nbsp  to the consolidated financial statements for an illustration of the effect of seasonality on our results of operations 
inflation nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations during the three years ended december nbsp   although most recent data available indicates that there has been a modest increase in the overall inflation levels impacting our business 
there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material impact in the future 
recently issued accounting pronouncements nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  during the third quarter of  we adopted financial accounting standards board pronouncements nos
