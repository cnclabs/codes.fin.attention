safe harbor for forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  excluding historical information  may include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to the outlook for earnings  revenues  and other future financial business performance or strategies and expectations 
forward looking statements are typically identified by words such as  but not limited to  estimates  expects  anticipates  intends  believes  plans  and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will  should  would  and could 
although wgl holdings believes such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  it cannot give assurance that every objective will be reached 
forward looking statements speak only as of today  and wgl holdings assumes no duty to update them 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance changes in economic  competitive  political and regulatory conditions and developments  changes in capital and energy commodity market conditions  changes in credit market conditions and creditworthiness of customers and suppliers  changes in relevant laws and regulations  including tax  environmental and employment laws and regulations  weather conditions  legislative  regulatory and judicial mandates and decisions  timing and success of business and product development efforts  technological improvements  the pace of deregulation efforts and the availability of other competitive alternatives  terrorist activities  and other uncertainties 
such factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond the company s direct control 
accordingly  while it believes that the assumptions are reasonable  the company cannot ensure that all expectations and objectives will be realized 
the company urges readers to use care and consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors that could affect the company s business as described in this annual report 
all forward looking statements made in this report rely upon the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of overview wgl holdings  through its subsidiaries  sells and delivers natural gas and provides a variety of energy related products and services to customers primarily in the metropolitan washington  dc  maryland  and virginia areas 
the company s core subsidiary  washington gas  is involved in the distribution and sale of natural gas that is primarily regulated by state regulatory commissions 
in response to changes in federal and state regulation  the company has taken the initiative to offer competitively priced natural gas and electricity to customers through its unregulated retail energy marketing subsidiary 
the company also offers energy related products and services that are closely related to its core business 
the majority of these energy related activities are performed by wholly owned subsidiaries of washington gas resources corp 
washington gas resources 
wgl holdings has three core operating segments regulated utility  retail energy marketing  and heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac products and services 
these three segments are described below regulated utility 
with over percent of the company s assets  washington gas delivers natural gas to retail customers in accordance with tariffs set by state or district of columbia regulatory commissions that have jurisdiction over washington gas rates 
these rates are intended to provide the regulated utility with an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on the investment devoted to the delivery of natural gas to customers 
washington gas also sells the natural gas commodity to customers who have not elected to purchase natural gas from unregulated third party marketers 
the regulated utility does not incur a profit or a loss when it sells the natural gas commodity as utility customers are charged for the natural gas commodity at the same cost the regulated utility incurs  subject to routine regulatory reviews of the reasonableness of these costs 
at september   the regulated utility was selling and delivering the natural gas commodity to approximately percent of its customers 
the remaining percent of washington gas customers utilize the delivery services of washington gas for delivery of the natural gas commodity purchased from third party marketers  one of which is a subsidiary of wgl holdings 
factors critical to the success of the regulated utility include operating a safe  reliable natural gas distribution system  and recovering the costs and expenses of this business  which include a fair rate of return on invested capital that is allowed by the regulatory commissions that have jurisdiction over the regulated utility s rates 
hampshire gas company  a wholly owned subsidiary of wgl holdings  is a regulated natural gas storage business that operates an underground storage field on behalf of washington gas in accordance with a tariff administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
retail energy marketing 
washington gas energy services  inc wgeservices  a wholly owned subsidiary of washington gas resources  competes with other third party marketers by selling natural gas and electricity directly to residential  commercial and industrial customers  both inside and outside of the regulated utility s traditional service territory 
wgeservices began selling electricity in fiscal year wgeservices has the opportunity to make a profit or the potential to incur a loss from these sales 
while wgeservices markets the natural gas and electricity commodities  regulated utilities such as washington gas deliver the natural gas and electric commodities to their customers 
no subsidiary or affiliate of the company owns or operates any electric generation  electric transmission or electric distribution assets 
factors critical to the success of the retail energy marketing business are managing the market risk of the difference between the sales price and the cost of natural gas and electricity  managing credit risks associated with customers and suppliers to this segment  and controlling the level of selling  general and administrative costs  most notably customer acquisition costs 
hvac 
two wholly owned subsidiaries  washington gas energy systems  inc wgesystems and american combustion industries  inc 
aci  provide turnkey design build renovation projects to the commercial and government markets 
for most of fiscal year  through a former percent equity investment in primary investors  llc primary investors  the hvac segment also installed  repaired and maintained hvac and plumbing equipment in the residential and small commercial markets 
as a result of a restructuring agreement on september  and a final closing on october  between the company and a percent co investor  the company no longer has any remaining equity investment in primary investors or any financial commitment to the residential hvac investment 
the commercial hvac operations focus on retrofitting a large number of aging commercial and government structures  primarily in the district of columbia and parts of maryland and virginia 
factors critical to the commercial hvac business success include the ability to maintain and grow the backlog of existing work through diversification of the market segments these subsidiaries serve and estimating and managing fixed price contracts

fiscal year results include a million loss from operations of the percent equity investment in residential hvac and a million after tax gain from the sale of two minor non utility assets 
summary of significant factors that affected the company s earnings winter weather 
the results of operations of the regulated utility are significantly affected by variations of winter weather from normal levels 
the regulated utility s rates are determined on the basis of expected normal weather conditions 
washington gas does not have a ratemaking provision that allows for revenues to be adjusted for the difference between actual weather conditions in a particular year and the expected normal weather conditions that are used to establish rates 
during fiscal year  winter weather  when measured by an industry standard called heating degree days  was approximately percent warmer than normal and percent warmer than fiscal year fiscal year was percent colder than normal and percent colder than fiscal year fiscal year was percent warmer than normal 
the company estimates that the effect of warmer than normal weather reduced earnings by million in fiscal year  before considering an million improvement for weather insurance 
in fiscal year  the colder than normal weather increased earnings by approximately million 
in fiscal year  warmer than normal weather reduced earnings by approximately million 
since fiscal year  the company has been managing its weather related business risk through an insurance policy that reimburses the company for a portion of the effect of deviations of weather from normal levels when the effect of weather is warmer than normal 
the weather insurance policy is described in the market risk weather risk section of this management s discussion and analysis and the accounting for the related transactions is described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
utility customer base and retail rates for natural gas delivery service 
during fiscal years  and  customer meters of washington gas increased by percent  percent and percent  respectively over the prior fiscal year 
washington gas had no change in the base rates charged for natural gas delivery service during fiscal years through utility operation and maintenance expenses 
utility operation and maintenance expenses for fiscal year increased million over the same period last year 
this was due principally to a million increase in labor and benefits related expenses  primarily pensions and post retirement medical and life insurance expenses  and a million increase in consulting expenses incurred in connection with washington gas initiatives to improve operational efficiencies and productivity 
other issues that contributed to the rise include a million increase related to professional services for audits  financial consulting and information technology services and million required to outsource mail services as a result of security concerns 
mitigating these increases was a million net decrease in the regulated utility segment s uncollectible accounts expense principally due to lower natural gas costs and warmer weather in the current year which in turn lowered customer bills 
this decrease in utility uncollectible accounts expense in fiscal year was net of a million provision for uncollectible accounts for ancillary services and reimbursements for damages to utility property and not related to the sale or delivery of natural gas 
operation and maintenance expenses in fiscal year increased million from the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in utility uncollectible accounts expense and a million increase in labor related expenses 
utility depreciation and amortization expense 
in fiscal years and  depreciation and amortization expense increased over the prior year by million and million  respectively 
these increases primarily reflect higher depreciation associated with increased investments in property  plant and equipment that result from customer growth and the increased cost of replacing capacity to serve existing customers  primarily due to inflation 
interest expense 
during fiscal year  interest expense decreased by million due to lower short term borrowings stemming from lower accounts receivable  unrecovered gas costs and storage gas inventory balances  coupled with significantly lower short term interest rates 
this reduction was partially offset by higher long term debt outstanding 
during fiscal year  additional debt was issued to fund a higher volume and cost of storage gas balances  increased customer accounts receivable and higher levels of unrecovered gas costs as compared with fiscal year non utility operations 
the results for non utility operations are presented in the consolidated statements of income  before other income expenses net  interest expense and dividends on preferred stock 
net income for the non utility operations is also presented in the operating segment reporting see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the non utility operating results reflect an operating loss for fiscal years and of million and million  respectively 
these results are discussed in detail in the non utility operating results section 
regulated utility operating results the company s regulated utility operations include results of the company s combined operations to render utility service in the district of columbia  maryland  and virginia 
the regulated utility operations reflect operating income  which is before other income expenses net  interest expense and dividends on preferred stock  for fiscal years  and of million  million  and million  respectively 
for purposes of the discussion below  the appropriate assignment and allocations of other income expenses net  interest expense and dividends on preferred stock were made to report net income for these operations on a segment basis 
during fiscal years  and  utility operations contributed million  million and million  respectively  toward net income 
the following table provides the factors contributing to the changes in utility net revenues between years 
composition of changes in utility net revenues increase decrease from prior year in millions volumetric effect of gas delivered to firm customers gas delivered to interruptible customers rights of way fees and gross receipts taxes total utility net revenues 
utility net revenues decreased million or percent in fiscal year and increased by million or percent in fiscal year the decline in utility net revenues in fiscal year resulted primarily from a percent decrease in deliveries to firm customers  reflecting percent warmer weather in fiscal year partially offset by a percent rise in customer meters 
as weather in fiscal year was percent colder than in fiscal year  fiscal year deliveries to firm customers rose percent 
in addition  the number of customers increased by percent in fiscal year rights of way fees and gross receipts taxes increased by million and million during fiscal years and  respectively over the prior years results 
the change in both fiscal years and primarily reflect fluctuations within rights of way fees and gross receipts taxes  which are impacted by changes in volumes  and are included as a corresponding amount in the line above entitled volumetric effect of gas delivered to firm customers 
the regulated utility is allowed recovery of these amounts from its customers and therefore these fees do not affect total net revenues 
in addition  tempering these changes were lower revenues associated with asset management activities of million  net of sharing  from fiscal year and increased revenue of million  net of sharing over fiscal year asset optimization agreements allow the regulated utility to generate revenue from optimizing the value of its contractual assets for transportation and storage of natural gas on the interstate pipeline 
for fiscal year  revenues from asset management activities are expected to decline due to the expectation of lower values attributable to such arrangements and to a recent order of the public service commission of the district of columbia psc of dc that approved washington gas proposal that the regulated utility share percent of the district of columbia s share of such revenues with customers on a prospective basis 
this order is not final 
utility gas delivered to firm customers 
the level of gas delivered is highly sensitive to weather variability because a large portion of the natural gas delivered by washington gas is used for space heating 
the regulated utility s rates are based on normal weather and none of the tariffs for the jurisdictions in which it operates currently have a weather normalization provision 
nonetheless  declining block rates  which reflect higher rates for the initial units delivered in a given month  reduce the impact of deviations from normal weather on net revenues in the utility s maryland and virginia jurisdictions 
during fiscal year  deliveries to the utility s firm customers decreased by million therms in relation to fiscal year and increased by million therms in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the year to year changes primarily reflect the impact of weather and the continued increase in customer meters as discussed above 
these changes include therms identified as firm in the selected financial and operations data under the captions gas sold and delivered and gas delivered for others 
utility gas delivered to interruptible customers 
deliveries to interruptible customers during fiscal year increased by million therms or percent over the fiscal year level 
the increase in fiscal year reflects a reduction in interruptible curtailment and higher demand due to lower gas costs 
deliveries to interruptible customers in fiscal year decreased by million therms or percent from fiscal year levels due to colder weather in fiscal year  which caused greater curtailments  and the competitive effects of higher natural gas prices 
the impact on net income of changes in gas deliveries to interruptible customers is minimal due to margin sharing arrangements in each of the regulated utility s jurisdictions  which results in the majority of gross margins for interruptible service being returned to firm customers 
the regulated utility sells and or delivers natural gas for use at two electric generation facilities in maryland  which are each owned by companies independent of washington gas 
variations in the volumes of deliveries to these two customers have little impact on utility net revenues and net income because of a margin sharing arrangement in maryland 
under that arrangement  the regulated utility calculates the gross margins  less related expenses  and the cost to recover the regulated utility s investment in the facilities constructed to serve these two customers 
after reducing the revenue stream by the expense  most of the net revenue is credited to the firm customers rates 
during fiscal year deliveries to these customers increased by million therms while fiscal year deliveries decreased by million therms versus fiscal year fiscal year deliveries were unusually high  reflecting operating interruptions at one customer s oil burning plant whereby the customer was required to use more natural gas 
utility cost of gas 
the utility s cost of natural gas includes both fixed and variable components 
the regulated utility pays fixed costs or demand charges to pipeline companies for system capacity needed to transport and store natural gas 
the regulated utility pays variable costs  or the cost of the natural gas commodity itself  to natural gas producers 
variations in the utility s cost of gas expense result from changes in gas sales volumes  the price of the gas purchased and the level of gas costs collected through the operation of firm gas cost recovery mechanisms 
under these regulated recovery mechanisms  the regulated utility records cost of gas expense equal to the cost of gas recovered from customers and included in revenues 
the difference between the firm gas costs paid and the gas costs recovered from customers is deferred on the balance sheet as an amount to be collected from or refunded to customers in future periods 
therefore  increases or decreases in the cost of gas associated with sales made to firm customers have no direct effect on net revenues and net income 
revenues can vary widely on an annual basis because of changes in the cost of gas  but such variations will not have any impact on net revenues or net income 
the commodity costs of gas invoiced to the utility  excluding the cost and related volumes applicable to sales made outside of the utility s service territory  referred to as offsystem sales  were and per therm for fiscal years and  respectively 
this lower cost in fiscal year reflects lower demand in the natural gas commodity market on a relative basis between the two years 
fiscal year gas costs were relatively higher versus fiscal year due to extremely cold weather during the winter of fiscal year the utility s net cost of gas  on a per therm basis  decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the decrease reflects higher commodity gas prices in fiscal year associated with the greater demand caused by the extremely cold weather  partially offset by higher fixed costs per therm in fiscal year due to lower volumes delivered 
utility other operating expenses  general taxes and depreciation 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million or percent in fiscal year and increased million or percent in fiscal year from the fiscal year results 
the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in operation and maintenance expenses 
composition of changes in operation and maintenance expenses increase decrease over prior year in millions non labor operating expenses pension and postretirement medical and life insurance benefit expenses technological initiatives non recurring reserve for customer billing refunds labor and labor related expenses uncollectible accounts total the increase in fiscal year non labor operating expenses primarily consists of million in professional fees incurred to achieve management objectives to improve greater operational efficiency and of the higher costs of public liability insurance 
other drivers for the higher costs include million related to professional services for audits  financial services and information technology outsourcing and million for improving mail security 
other smaller increases relate to higher volume of paving work  higher volume of customer origination work  higher pipeline easements and greater pipe location work 
labor and labor related expenses decreased million primarily because of fewer employees and lower incentive pay accruals for performance based incentive awards during fiscal year pension income related to the company s pension fund declined in fiscal year due to less favorable financial market conditions and expenses related to postretirement benefits other than pensions rose as a result of increased estimates of future medical inflation 
pension and postretirement medical and life insurance expenses are expected to increase in fiscal year by approximately million  largely as the result of continued relatively weak financial performance related to the company s pension plan and decreasing interest rates which cause an increase in the discounted liabilities associated with the plan benefits 
the provision for uncollectible accounts  which decreased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year  reflects lower natural gas costs and warmer weather in fiscal year these factors both caused a drop in the provision in this decrease in utility uncollectible accounts expense in fiscal year was net of a million provision for uncollectible accounts for ancillary services  and damages to company property  neither of which was related to the sale or delivery of natural gas 
in fiscal year  the provision rose from the fiscal level due to of the much colder weather and higher gas costs in relation to fiscal year general taxes decreased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year largely due to the reduction in certain revenue based rights of way fees imposed by the district of columbia  a tax expense which is recorded on a volumetric basis and higher than normal general taxes in fiscal year fiscal year also reflected a million one time adjustment for a virginia business license tax payment made as a result of a tax law restructuring 
general taxes increased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year the district of columbia rights of way fees  implemented in  which are being collected in rates  generated most of this increase 
during fiscal years and  depreciation and amortization rose by million or percent  and million or percent  respectively 
the increases reflect gross additions to property  plant and equipment that were made to meet continuing customer growth and to upgrade or replace existing facilities and systems 
the utility s composite depreciation rate was percent for fiscal year and percent for fiscal year the consolidated statements of income taxes detail the composition of the change in income tax expense for the company 
income taxes for the regulated utility segment decreased by million in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to lower pre tax income and deferred tax adjustments 
deferred state income tax expense for the regulated utility was recorded to reflect a new utility tax liability in fiscal year in maryland and virginia effective october  and january   respectively 
for the non utility segment  income taxes increased million in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily reflecting the combined effect of higher pre tax income offset by recording tax benefits for the primary investors investment losses 
a million decrease in income taxes for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year primarily reflects reduced pre tax income 
for more information  see wgl holdings consolidated statements of income taxes and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
non utility operating results the non utility operating results reflect an operating loss  before other income expenses net and interest expense  for fiscal years and of million and million  respectively 
for fiscal year these operations reported operating income of million 
for purposes of the discussion below  the appropriate assignments and allocations of other income expenses net and interest were made to report net income loss for these operations on a segment basis 
the non utility operating results include two segments retail energy marketing and hvac 
these segments  plus the impact of other incidental non utility activities  posted a net loss of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  and reported net income of million for fiscal year these results include million and million in non recurring impairment provisions for residential hvac operations in fiscal years and  respectively  and million  million  and million of net operating losses from residential hvac in fiscal years   and respectively 
they furthermore include an unusual  infrequent net loss of million from the company s inactive consumer financing business in fiscal year and million of after tax gains from sales of minor non utility assets in fiscal year the following table shows the composition of the changes in revenues for these non utility operations 
composition of changes in non utility revenues increase decrease over prior year in millions retail energy marketing hvac commercial other activities total the following discussion describes the results of operations for each of the non utility segments and other activities 
retail energy marketing 
the company s retail energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  was established in and sells natural gas on an unregulated  competitive basis directly to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
in fiscal year  it began selling electricity on an unregulated basis 
revenues for this segment have grown over the past three years and were million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the retail energy marketing segment had   and  natural gas customers at september    and  respectively 
electricity was provided to  customers at september   compared to  customers at september  wgeservices has also experienced a steady increase in the volume of gas sold  with billion cubic feet bcf sold in fiscal year  bcf sold in fiscal year  and bcf sold in fiscal year in addition to gas sales  wgeservices sold billion kilowatt hours kwh of electricity in fiscal year compared to billion kwh in fiscal year operating expenses of the retail energy marketing company rose by million and million in and  respectively  principally from the higher cost of gas and electricity sold 
net income from the retail energy marketing segment was million in fiscal year  compared to a net loss of million in fiscal year and net income of million in fiscal year fiscal year net income reflects more than double the level of gross margins from natural gas sales stemming from a percent increase in therms sold to a percent larger natural gas customer base 
natural gas gross margins per therm also improved because gas costs decreased from prior year levels 
since wgeservices sells natural gas at a fixed price over the term of its contracts  the shape of the forward price curve for natural gas purchases will cause gross margins to widen and narrow over time 
when gas costs increase  wgeservices experiences smaller margins as it locks in customer sales and matches them with volumes purchased in the marketplace at current costs 
conversely  in periods of declining gas costs  wgeservices is able to achieve higher gross margins 
gross margins from the sale of electricity increased over four times from the prior year as volumes sold tripled  the number of customers increased fifty percent and margins per kwh improved slightly 
electricity is purchased under a full requirements contract from the owner of several large power plants located near the company s retail electric customers 
some of the companies from whom wgeservices purchases natural gas and the sole provider of electricity under the full requirements contract mentioned above have relatively low or below investment grade credit ratings as determined by major credit rating agencies 
depending on the future ability of these suppliers to deliver natural gas or electricity under existing contracts  wgeservices could be exposed financially for the difference between the price at which wgeservices has contracted to buy natural gas and electricity  and the cost of any replacement natural gas or electricity that may need to be purchased if a supplier fails to fulfill its obligation to deliver energy to wgeservices 
hvac 
two subsidiaries  aci and wgesystems  which offer large scale hvac installations and related services to commercial and government customers  are included in the company s commercial hvac activities 
in addition  during fiscal years  and  the company had a percent equity investment in primary investors  a limited liability company that focused on investments in companies that provide products and services to residential and light commercial hvac customers 
revenues from commercial hvac activities were million in fiscal year  a decrease of million from the prior year 
the reduction in fiscal year was the result of a decline in the number of commercial design and build projects derived from one major customer  a local government 
in fiscal year  percent of revenues were generated from one customer  the federal government  and in fiscal year  percent of revenues were derived from these two major customers 
in fiscal year  revenues from commercial hvac activities were million  an increase of million or percent over fiscal year results 
net income from commercial hvac activities was million in fiscal year this compares to million of net income in fiscal year the decrease in net income in fiscal year reflected the completion of work for one major customer and an increase in bad debt expense 
net income in fiscal year was million 
the company s percent equity investment in primary investors resulted in a million after tax loss from operations excluding a million permanent impairment provision discussed below in fiscal year the company reported after tax losses from operations of million in fiscal year excluding a million permanent impairment provision and a million loss from operations in fiscal year over the course of fiscal year  management recorded million in non cash permanent impairment provisions to reflect a permanent decline in value 
this impairment provision  and previous impairment provisions and operating losses have eliminated the book value of the company s investment in primary investors as of september  on september   wgl holdings and a co investor entered into an agreement to restructure primary investors  with a final closing on october   such that wgl holdings has no remaining financial commitment to the co investor  primary investors or any affiliate of primary investors see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other activities 
some of the transactions for the company are not significant enough on a stand alone basis to warrant treatment as a segment and the transactions do not fit into one of the segments contained in the company s financial statements 
with respect to segment reporting  these transactions are aggregated in the section called other activities see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these transactions are included in the consolidated statements of income in non utility operations 
the segment definition included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements was revised in fiscal year to reflect the company s operating changes in late in its consumer financing operations 
the consumer financing operations were changed such that the company did not actively write any new loans in fiscal year  but rather  limited its operations to servicing existing loans 
accordingly  other activities also includes transactions related to the company s consumer financing operation  which was reported as a segment in fiscal years and financial reports 
the previously reported consumer financing segment for fiscal years and were restated to combine this segment into other activities 
the results of operations for other activities in fiscal year reflected a net loss of million due to a million after tax loss from a consumer financing business and miscellaneous expenses of the corporate holding company  such as corporate insurance  and a million charge for consolidated tax savings which is allocated to other segments but which has no impact on the consolidated statements of income of the company 
other income expenses net and interest expense the information below for other income expenses net and interest expense is reported on a consolidated basis 
other income expenses net improved by million for the year ended september  in relation to the year ended september  the primary reason for the improvement is million of net income from the proceeds of the regulated utility s weather insurance policy  partially offset by a million charge  which is net of income taxes  associated with a bad debt expense related to a bankrupt energy company  together with other miscellaneous items 
for segment reporting purposes  the cost and benefits of weather insurance and the bad debt expense for the bankrupt energy company are reflected in the regulated utility segment 
total interest expense decreased by million or percent in fiscal year and increased million or percent in fiscal year approximately percent of interest expense is applicable to the regulated utility s operations 
the following table shows the components of the changes in interest expense between years 
composition of changes in interest expense increase decrease from prior year in millions long term debt short term debt other total long term debt 
the million increase in interest expense on long term debt during fiscal year reflects an increase of million in the average balance outstanding  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in the weighted average cost of long term debt 
the million increase in interest expense on long term debt during fiscal year primarily resulted from a million increase in the average balance outstanding 
the embedded cost of long term debt was percent  percent and percent at september   and  respectively 
short term debt 
the million decrease in interest expense on short term debt during fiscal year reflects a million decrease in the average balance outstanding and a percentage point decrease in the weighted average cost of short term debt 
the million increase in interest expense on short term debt during fiscal year reflects a million increase in the average balance outstanding  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in the weighted average cost of short term debt 
see short term cash requirements and related financing for a discussion of fluctuations in short term debt balances 
other 
other interest expense increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and million during fiscal year in relation to fiscal year the increase in both years is due primarily to a decrease in the accrual for allowance for funds used during construction afudc 
for more information on afudc see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources general factors affecting liquidity it is important for the company to have access to short term debt markets to maintain satisfactory liquidity to operate its businesses on a near term basis 
acquisition of natural gas  electricity  pipeline capacity and the need to finance accounts receivable are the most significant short term financing requirements of the company 
the need for long term capital is primarily driven by capital expenditures and maturity of long term debt 
significant swings can take place in the level of short term debt needed by the company due primarily to changes in the price of natural gas and the impact of weather on the volumes of natural gas and electricity that need to be purchased to satisfy customer demand 
satisfactory backup financing to the company s commercial paper program in the form of revolving credit agreements and bank lines of credit enables the company to maintain access to short term debt markets 
the ability of the company to obtain such financing depends on its credit ratings  which are greatly affected by financial performance and the liquidity of financial markets 
also potentially affecting access to short term debt capital is the nature of any restrictions that might be placed upon the company such as ratings triggers or a requirement to provide creditors with additional credit support in the event of a determination of unreasonable creditworthiness 
the ability to procure sufficient levels of long term capital at reasonable costs is determined by the level of the company s capital expenditure requirements  its financial performance  and the impact of these factors on its credit ratings and investment alternatives available to investors 
the company s access to short and long term capital may be affected by contract provisions related to a change in the company s creditworthiness 
the company has a goal to maintain its common equity ratio in the mid percent range of total consolidated capital 
in addition  the company typically plans to reduce short term debt balances in the spring  because a significant portion of the company s current assets are converted into cash at the end of the heating season 
accomplishing these objectives and maintaining sufficient cash flow are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings for the company and washington gas and to allow access to capital at relatively low costs 
as of september   total consolidated capitalization  including current maturities of long term debt  comprised percent common equity  percent preferred stock and percent long term debt 
the cash flow requirements of the company and the ability to provide satisfactory resources to satisfy those requirements are largely influenced by the activities of washington gas 
short term cash requirements and related financing the regulated utility s business is weather sensitive and seasonal  causing short term cash requirements to vary significantly during the year 
in fiscal year  approximately percent of the total therms delivered in the regulated utility s service area excluding deliveries to two electric generation facilities was made in the first and second fiscal quarters 
cash requirements peak in the fall and winter months when accounts receivable  accrued utility revenues and storage gas inventories are at their highest levels 
after the winter heating season  many of these assets are converted into cash  which the company generally uses to reduce and sometimes eliminate short term debt and acquire storage gas for the next heating season 
the company s retail energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  has seasonal short term cash requirements resulting from purchasing gas in periods that are not matched with the sale of this commodity 
in addition  wgeservices must finance its accounts receivable for the gas and electricity that it sells  and the accounts receivable balances are seasonal 
storage gas inventories represent gas purchased from producers and are stored in facilities primarily owned by interstate pipelines 
both the regulated utility and the retail energy marketing segment maintain storage gas inventory 
the regulated utility generally pays for storage gas between heating seasons and withdraws it during the heating season 
significant variations in storage balances at september are usually caused by the price paid to producers and marketers  which is a function of short term market fluctuations in gas costs 
for the regulated utility such costs become a component of the cost of gas recovered from customers when volumes are withdrawn from storage 
in addition  the regulated utility is able to charge carrying costs related to the level of storage gas inventory in the amount it recovers from its customers in two of the three jurisdictions in which it operates 
variations in the timing of collections of gas costs under the regulated utility s gas cost recovery mechanisms and the level of refunds from pipeline companies that will be returned to customers can significantly affect short term cash requirements 
at september   the regulated utility had a million net under collection of gas costs  compared to a million net under collection at september  the company reflects the amounts under collected and over collected in the captions gas costs due from customers and gas costs due to customers  respectively in the consolidated balance sheets 
the large reduction from the prior year is primarily due to the substantial collection of the balance as of september  during fiscal year  and a closer matching in fiscal year of gas costs paid to suppliers with gas costs recovered from customers 
most of the current balance will be collected from  or returned to customers in fiscal year at september   and  refunds received from pipelines and to be returned to the regulated utility s customers were not material 
the company and washington gas utilize short term debt in the form of commercial paper or unsecured short term bank loans to fund seasonal requirements 
alternate sources at september   include an unsecured seasonal line of credit of million held by washington gas  a million revolving credit agreement for washington gas and an million revolving credit agreement for wgl holdings  each maintained with a group of banks 
the company also has a million permanent line of credit and washington gas has a million permanent line of credit 
the company can activate these financing options to support or replace its commercial paper see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at september   the company had outstanding notes payable of million  compared to million outstanding at september  the decrease in notes payable from the prior year was primarily due to the decrease in the balance for storage gas inventory and additional issuances of long term debt to take advantage of attractive long term interest rates 
at september   current maturities of long term debt were million compared to million at september  contractual commitments and obligations wgl holdings has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond fiscal year these commitments include long term debt  lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations for pipeline capacity  transportation and storage services and certain natural gas and electricity commodity commitments 
the estimated obligations as of september  for various fiscal years are shown below 
estimated contractual obligations and commercial commitments assumes normal weather in millions after years ended september  total pipeline and storage contracts medium term notes electric purchase commitments gas purchase commitments other long term debt operating leases natural gas purchase contracts total the table above reflects fixed and variable obligations estimated on the basis of normal weather and average customer usage 
these estimates reflect the likely purchases under various contracts 
the contracted minimums are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimated contractual obligations and commercial commitments table includes million for pipeline and storage contracts that consists of million for washington gas and million for wgeservices 
medium term notes mtns and other long term debt of million and million  respectively  represent the principal liability with long term debt maturity payments reflected in fiscal years and beyond 
electric purchase commitments of million are wgeservices expected expenditures based on forecasted usage of its existing customer base 
this commitment is pursuant to an electric purchase contract with a wholesale energy marketer that is contractually tied to a full requirements service with no minimum commitments 
purchases will fluctuate based on customers actual usage 
wgeservices purchase commitments are million and represent fixed price commitments for gas delivered to washington gas city gate stations  including the cost of transportation to that point  which is bundled in the purchase price 
washington gas has million of natural gas purchase contracts with suppliers that expire in fiscal year these contracts represent a commitment for the natural gas commodity only and exclude the cost of transportation to the city gate 
wgl holdings has also made certain additional commitments that include financial guarantees  primarily to support the energy acquisition activities of the retail energy marketing segment 
on september   the total guarantees outstanding were million  which includes amounts guaranteed on behalf of affiliates to other affiliates 
of this guaranteed amount  million will remain in effect until the termination of a contractual agreement  or until cancelled at the option of the company or by the counterparty 
when a customer selects a third party marketer to provide supply  washington gas generally assigns pipeline and storage capacity to third party marketers to deliver gas to washington gas city gate 
in order to provide gas commodity to customers who do not select a third party marketer  washington gas has a commodity acquisition plan to acquire the natural gas supply to serve the customer 
in connection with this plan  washington gas utilizes an asset manager to acquire the necessary supply to serve these customers 
washington gas commitment to the asset manager is to purchase gas supply through march  at a market price that is tied to various public indices for natural gas 
the contract commitment is related to customer demand  there are no minimum bill commitments  and no amount is included in the table above for these contracts 
the company does have minimum bill commitments for three supply related contracts that are reflected in the table above 
long term cash requirements and related financing the company s long term cash requirements primarily depend upon the level of capital expenditures  long term debt maturity requirements and decisions to refinance long term debt 
the company devotes the majority of its capital expenditures to adding new regulated utility customers in its existing service area 
at september   washington gas was authorized to issue up to million of long term debt under an existing shelf registration 
washington gas expects to file a new shelf registration application in the spring of note of the notes to consolidated financial statements further explains the nature of the company s long term debt 
cash flow from operating activities 
in fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  compared to million in fiscal year the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of the difference between utilizing million of cash in fiscal year for gas costs that were paid but unrecovered from customers at september   and subsequently collecting million of these unrecovered gas costs in fiscal year this effect alone contributed million of the change in operating cash flow in fiscal year a reduction in net cash required to support storage gas balances provided million of the change  and changes in accounts payable of million also contributed to increased operating cash flow 
major offsets to these amounts were a million drop in net income and a million reduction in deferred income taxes primarily associated with the change in the balance of unrecovered gas costs due from customers 
in fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in fiscal year this change primarily reflected increased amounts needed in fiscal year to fund a significant rise in gas costs due from customers  an increase in other prepayments and a reduction in accounts payable 
partially offsetting these uses of cash in fiscal year was a million increase in net income adjusted for non cash items and a decrease in cash used to fund storage gas inventories 
cash flow from financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal year the main reason for the variation is the million of proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock in fiscal year and a million greater reduction in notes payable in fiscal year the decline in notes payable is due to a decrease in unrecovered gas costs from customers and storage gas balances 
the company derived million more from the net effect of long term debt issues and retirements in fiscal year than in fiscal year the following table shows the issuance and retirement of long term debt that occurred during fiscal years  and see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
long term debt activity in millions interest rate amount interest rate amount interest rate amount medium term notes issued retired project financing issued retired other various various various total the dividends paid on common stock by the company during fiscal year increased by million over fiscal year this increase was due primarily to recognizing a full year s effect in fiscal year of the issuance of  shares of common stock in june see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and a increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock which became effective for the dividend paid on may  cash flow from investing activities 
capital expenditures for fiscal years  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
investments in new business construction  which include amounts invested to convert customers from other energy sources  result in the capacity to deliver additional therms 
during fiscal years  and  capital expenditures for new business equaled million  million and million  respectively  which represented percent  percent and percent of each year s respective total capital expenditures 
in addition  the company made equity investments in primary investors of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
no future equity investments will be made in primary investors 
other investing activities relate to the company financing certain construction projects on behalf of its commercial hvac subsidiary 
during fiscal year  the company received million from the sales of minor non utility investments 
during fiscal year  the sum of net income and non cash charges  less dividends on common stock totaled million  which represented percent of capital expenditures and investments 
for fiscal years and  respectively  the sum of net income and non cash charges  less dividends on common stock  totaled million and million  which represented percent and percent of capital expenditures plus investments 
sales and repurchases of accounts receivable in late  the company reduced its consumer financing operations and did not write new loans in fiscal year  but rather  limited its operations to servicing existing loans 
accordingly  the cash generated from the consumer financing operation was limited to collection of the principal and interest for existing loans that were netted against loan pools 
in prior periods  loan pools were created to convert the loans to cash through the sale of these pools to commercial banks 
during fiscal year and  the company augmented cash flow by selling these pools which amounted to million and million  respectively 
in connection with the pools  the company repurchased certain of these loans from the commercial banks in the amount of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
security ratings the table below reflects credit ratings for outstanding debt instruments of wgl holdings and washington gas at december  credit rating agencies can revise their credit ratings at any time 
wgl holdings washington gas unsecured medium term commercial unsecured commercial rating service notes indicative paper medium term notes paper fitch  inc a f aa f moody s investors service p a p standard poor s corporation aa a aa a indicates the ratings that would be applicable if wgl holdings were to issue unsecured medium term notes 
unpublished ratings triggers and certain debt covenants in the event the long term debt of washington gas is downgraded below certain levels  wgl holdings and washington gas are required to pay higher facility fees on their revolving credit agreements 
also under the revolving credit agreements  the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization can not exceed to percent 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreements  the company is required to inform lenders of changes in corporate existence  financial conditions  litigation and environmental warranties that might have a material adverse effect 
the failure to inform the lenders agent of changes in these areas deemed material in nature might constitute default under the agreement 
a default  if unremedied  may lead to a suspension of further loans and or acceleration in which obligations become immediately due and payable 
in connection with certain gas purchase and pipeline capacity agreements  in the event the long term debt of washington gas is downgraded below bbb by standard poor s or below baa by moody s  or washington gas is deemed by a counterparty not to be creditworthy  the counterparty may withhold service or deliveries  or may require additional credit support 
capital expenditures the following table shows the company s actual capital expenditures for fiscal years  and and projected capital expenditures for fiscal years through this table excludes the company s investment in primary investors of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the company s capital expenditure program includes investments to extend service to new areas and to ensure safe  reliable and improved service 
the increase in capital expenditures from to primarily reflected a major system improvement project necessary for future customer growth and also an increase in customers added 
the to projected period includes million for continued growth to serve new customers and million primarily for replacement and betterment projects 
the projected period also reflects million of other expenditures  primarily general plant and support services 
the company believes that the combination of available internal and external sources of funds will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures 
capital expenditures actual projected in millions total new business replacements other total competition the core business of the regulated utility faces competition based on customers preferences for natural gas compared to other energy products and the comparative prices of those products 
currently  the most significant product competition occurs between natural gas and electricity in the residential market 
the residential market generates a significant proportion of the regulated utility s net income 
in its service territory  washington gas continues to attract the majority of the new residential construction market 
the company believes that consumers continuing preference for natural gas allows washington gas to maintain a strong presence 
the regulated utility has generally maintained a price advantage over electricity in its service area 
increases in the price of the natural gas commodity during the winter of fiscal year altered this situation somewhat 
however  by the end of fiscal year and during fiscal year  natural gas prices have settled to more traditional levels 
furthermore  as discussed below  restructuring in both the natural gas and electric industries is leading to changes in traditional pricing models 
as part of the electric industry restructuring effort  certain business segments are moving toward market based pricing  with third party marketers of electricity participating in retail markets 
electric industry restructuring may result in lower comparative pricing for electric service and other alternative energy sources  including natural gas 
these changes could result in increased competition for the regulated utility 
in the interruptible market  the regulated utility s customers must be capable of using a fuel other than natural gas when demand by the regulated utility s firm customers peaks 
fuel oil is the most significant competing energy alternative to natural gas 
the regulated utility s success in this market depends largely on the relationship between gas and oil prices 
because the supply of natural gas is primarily derived from domestic sources  the relationship between supply and demand generally has the greatest impact on natural gas prices 
as a large portion of oil comes from foreign sources  political events can have significant influences on oil supplies and accordingly  oil prices 
deregulation in each of the jurisdictions the district of columbia  maryland and virginia served by the company s regulated utility  regulators and utilities have implemented customer choice programs 
these programs provide customers with an opportunity to choose to purchase their natural gas and or electric commodity from third party marketers  rather than purchasing these commodities as part of a bundled service from the local utility 
when customers choose to purchase their natural gas commodity from a third party marketer  there is no impact on the regulated utility s net revenues or net income because washington gas passes the cost of gas to customers without any mark up 
however  these customer choice programs provide unregulated third party marketers  such as wgeservices  with opportunities to profit from the sale of the natural gas commodity or electricity in competitive markets 
participating in this rapidly evolving marketplace also poses new risks and challenges discussed below that must be addressed in the company s current and future strategies 
the natural gas delivery function the natural gas delivery function  the core business of the company s regulated utility  continues to be regulated by local regulatory commissions 
in developing this core business  washington gas has invested over billion to construct a safe  reliable and economical natural gas distribution system 
because of the high fixed costs and significant safety and environmental considerations associated with building and operating a distribution system  it is expected that there will continue to be only one owner and operator of a natural gas distribution system per franchise area for the foreseeable future 
the nature of washington gas customer base and the distance of most customers from interstate pipelines mitigate the threat of bypass of its facilities by other potential delivery service providers 
washington gas expects that local regulatory commissions will continue to set the prices and terms for delivery service that give it an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on the capital invested in its distribution system and to recover reasonable operating expenses 
washington gas plans to continue constructing  operating and maintaining its natural gas distribution system 
the company does not foresee any significant near term changes in the regulated utility s risk profile 
the merchant function and natural gas unbundling the implementation of customer choice programs for natural gas customers is well underway in the district of columbia  maryland and virginia 
at september  all of the customers served by washington gas were eligible to participate in customer choice programs 
out of approximately  customers at september   approximately  customers purchased their natural gas commodity from unregulated third party marketers 
ultimately  the company expects the regulated utility may play a much smaller role in the merchant function and may eventually exit the merchant function as customers buy natural gas from unregulated marketers 
during this transition period  washington gas continues to have certain obligations under long term contracts to purchase natural gas from producers and transportation capacity from interstate pipeline companies 
accordingly  the strategy of washington gas focuses on managing efficiently the portfolio of contractual resources  recovering contractual costs and maximizing the value of contractual assets 
washington gas actively manages its supply portfolio to balance its sales and supply obligations 
currently  the regulated utility includes the cost of the natural gas commodity and pipeline services in the purchased gas costs that it includes in firm customers rates  subject to regulatory review 
the regulated utility s jurisdictional tariffs contain gas cost mechanisms that allow it to recover the invoice cost of gas applicable to firm customers 
washington gas believes it prudently entered into its gas contracts and that the costs being incurred should be recoverable from customers 
if future unbundling or other initiatives remove the current gas cost recovery provisions  washington gas could be adversely impacted to the extent it incurs non competitive gas costs without other satisfactory regulatory mechanisms available to recover any costs that may exceed market prices 
washington gas currently has recovery mechanisms for such potentially stranded costs in the district of columbia  maryland and virginia 
if washington gas were to determine that competition or changing regulation would preclude it from recovering these costs in rates  these costs would be charged to expense without any corresponding revenue recovery 
if this situation were to occur and depending upon the timing of the occurrence  the impact on washington gas financial position and results of operations would likely be significant 
in the event that a regulatory body disallows the recovery of such costs  these costs would be borne by shareholders 
to minimize its exposure to contract risks  washington gas has mechanisms in its customer choice programs to assign to participating third party marketers approximately percent of the storage and peak winter capacity resources that were dedicated to serving bundled service customers when those customers elected a third party marketer 
washington gas currently has mechanisms filed or approved with each of its local commissions to assign up to percent of the storage  transportation and peak winter capacity resources beginning during the heating season 
washington gas continually updates its forecasts of customer growth and the associated requirements for pipeline transportation  storage and peaking resources 
while the regulated utility is not renewing expiring long term gas commodity contracts at the present time  it is generally renewing pipeline transportation and storage contracts to meet its forecasts of increased customer gas requirements and to comply with regulatory mechanisms to provide for or make available such resources to marketers serving customers in the customer choice programs 
as the gas commodity contracts expire  washington gas enters into flexible short term purchasing arrangements to meet demand 
this strategy mitigates the exposure to long term commitments beyond minimum ferc approved contract requirements  while ensuring reliable and competitively priced gas for customers who continue to buy the natural gas commodity from the regulated utility 
to maximize the value of its contractual assets  the regulated utility has entered into contracts with unregulated marketers who make use of the regulated utility s firm storage and transportation rights to meet the regulated utility s city gate delivery needs and to make off system sales when such storage and transportation rights are underutilized 
the regulated utility continues to pay the fixed charges associated with the firm storage and transportation contracts used to make sales 
unregulated retail energy marketing and natural gas and electric unbundling as the regulated utility s role in the merchant function decreases over time  opportunities emerge for unregulated natural gas providers 
in the deregulated marketplace  third party marketers have profit making opportunities  but also assume the risk of loss 
recognizing the opportunities presented by competition  the company established wgeservices  an unregulated retail energy marketing subsidiary in fiscal year wgeservices now markets both natural gas and electricity to residential  commercial and industrial customers both inside and outside of the washington gas service area 
to date  wgeservices has grown to nearly  natural gas customers and  electric customers compared to  natural gas customers and  electric customers in fiscal year the initial year of electric sales  and  natural gas customers in fiscal year wgeservices gross revenues in fiscal years and  which include both sales of natural gas and electricity  were million and million  respectively 
wgeservices had net income of million in fiscal year and incurred a net loss of million in fiscal year  due mainly to acquisition costs associated with obtaining new electricity customers 
during fiscal year  wgeservices had revenues of million from natural gas customers and net income of million 
the regulatory process tends to stabilize rates and revenues of the regulated utility 
however  there can be significant volatility for unregulated third party marketers  such as wgeservices 
thus  while wgeservices has a significant potential for continued growth  it must carefully manage risks in a volatile commodity market 
wgeservices competes with other third party marketers as well as with regulated utilities to sell the unregulated natural gas commodity to customers 
marketers of the natural gas commodity compete largely on price  and gross margins are relatively small 
consequently  net income as a percentage of sales of unregulated natural gas is much lower than the comparable relationship to the regulated utility 
in addition  wgeservices faces supply side risks 
to minimize these risks  wgeservices strategy is to manage its natural gas contract portfolio in a manner that closely aligns the volumes of gas it purchases with firm commitments from customers to purchase this gas and enter into transactions to moderate gas supply cost volatility 
wgeservices purchases its gas from a number of wholesale suppliers in order to avoid relying on any single provider for its natural gas supply 
additionally  wgeservices maintains gas storage inventory to meet daily and monthly fluctuations in demand caused by variations in normal weather 
similarly  wgeservices dependency on any one customer or group of customers is limited 
beginning in fiscal year  wgeservices entered into derivative contracts in order to balance its sales commitments with the amount of gas it must purchase to satisfy those commitments 
wgeservices has a risk management policy in place and periodically reassesses its policy to determine its adequacy to mitigate risks in changing markets 
customer choice programs are not unique to the natural gas industry 
choice for electric customers has been implemented in each jurisdiction in which the regulated utility operates 
similar to the natural gas industry  participants in these programs can choose either to continue purchasing bundled electricity service from their local electric distribution utility or to purchase electricity from a third party marketer 
wgeservices competes with other third party marketers to sell electric supply services to customers 
marketers of electric supply service compete largely on price  and gross margins are relatively small 
in anticipation of the opportunities to sell electricity in jurisdictions that have implemented customer choice programs  wgeservices entered into a master purchase and sale agreement in april with a wholesale energy marketer 
under the agreement  as wgeservices identifies profitable opportunities  it purchases electric energy  capacity and certain ancillary services from the wholesaler for resale to retail electricity customers 
in each jurisdiction that has introduced customer choice programs  wgeservices evaluates the associated profit potential and other strategic factors 
wgeservices does not own or operate any electric generation  electric transmission or electric distribution assets 
some of the supplier companies that sell gas to wgeservices and the sole provider of electricity under the full requirements contract mentioned above  have relatively low or below investment grade credit ratings as determined by major credit rating agencies 
depending on the future ability of these suppliers to deliver natural gas or electricity under existing contracts  wgeservices could be financially exposed for the difference between the price at which wgeservices has contracted to buy natural gas and electricity  and the cost of any replacement natural gas or electricity that may need to be purchased 
potential for further unbundling currently  the company s regulated utility provides customer services  such as preparing bills  reading meters and responding to customer inquiries  as part of its core utility function 
unregulated third party marketers have the option to assume responsibility for bill preparation and customer collections 
in addition to billing and collecting from customers for the natural gas commodity  third party marketers bills may include natural gas delivery charges due the regulated utility  which are subsequently remitted to washington gas 
although washington gas still provides most customer services on a bundled basis  the potential exists for future deregulation initiatives to separate these services from the core utility function 
in that case  customers could choose to have unregulated competitors provide these services 
to remain competitive  the company strives to improve quality and efficiency and to reduce costs with the goal of achieving market level performance 
accordingly  the company will continue to look for opportunities to profit from further unbundling 
other factors affecting the company critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the selection and the application of appropriate technical accounting rules to the relevant facts and circumstances of the company s operations  as well as the use of estimates by management to compile the consolidated financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies necessarily involves judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events  including the likelihood of success of particular regulatory initiatives  the likelihood of actualizing environmental estimates and the probability of recovering costs and investments in both the regulated utility and non utility operations 
these judgments  in and of themselves  materially impact the financial statements and the related disclosures 
the company has identified four critical accounting policies discussed below that require judgment and estimation  where such estimates have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for utility revenue and cost of gas recognition 
for regulated deliveries of natural gas  washington gas reads meters and bills customers on a cycle basis 
it accrues revenues for gas that has been delivered but not yet billed at the end of an accounting period 
such revenues are recognized as unbilled revenue and those revenues are adjusted in the subsequent period when actual meter readings are taken 
the regulated utility s jurisdictional tariffs contain mechanisms that provide for the recovery of the invoice cost of gas applicable to firm customers 
under these mechanisms  the regulated utility periodically adjusts its firm customers rates to reflect increases and decreases in the invoice cost of gas 
annually  the regulated utility reconciles the difference between the total gas costs collected from firm customers and the invoice cost of gas 
the regulated utility defers any excess or deficiency and subsequently either recovers it from  or refunds it to  customers over the following twelve month period 
the gas costs due from customers and gas costs due to customers captions  reported in the consolidated balance sheet  reflect amounts related to these reconciliations 
accounting for regulated operations regulatory assets and liabilities 
a significant portion of the company s business is subject to regulation 
as the regulated utility industry continues to address competitive market issues  the cost of service regulation used to compensate the company s regulated utility for the cost of its regulated operations will continue to evolve 
non traditional ratemaking initiatives and market based pricing of products and services could have additional long term financial implications for the company 
management has relied on its projection of continued regulatory oversight of its operations in order to validate the carrying cost of the regulated utility investment in fixed assets 
the company s regulated utility records the results of its regulated activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non regulated businesses 
sfas no 
requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue and expense in non regulated businesses 
in certain circumstances  sfas no 
allows entities whose rates are determined by third party regulators to defer costs as regulatory assets in the balance sheet to the extent that the entity expects to recover these costs in future rates 
future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the company discontinuing the application of sfas no 
for some of its businesses and require the write off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery or refund 
in effect  the company s regulated utility could be required to write off certain regulatory assets that had been deferred in prior period consolidated balance sheets and charge these costs to expenses at the time it determines that the provisions of sfas no 
no longer apply 
if wgl holdings was required to discontinue the application of sfas no 
for its operations  it would theoretically have an extraordinary non cash charge to income for the net book value of its regulatory assets and liabilities 
other adjustments might also be required 
management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas no 
and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory environment 
accounting for income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 the company recognizes deferred income taxes for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires recognition of the additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences when regulators have flowed through income tax benefits or costs to ratepayers 
regulatory assets or liabilities corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities may be recorded to the extent the company believes they will be recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process 
amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service 
accounting for contingencies 
the company recognizes contingent liabilities utilizing sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
by their nature  the amount of the contingency and the timing of a contingent event are subject to management s judgment of such events and management s estimates of the amounts 
these contingent events and amounts are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
industry consolidation in recent years  the energy industry has seen a number of consolidations  combinations  disaggregations and other strategic alliances 
these changes are being driven  in part  as energy companies seek to offer a broader range of energy services to compete more effectively in attracting and retaining customers 
for example  affiliations with other operating utilities could potentially result in economies and synergies and could provide customers with a wider range of energy services 
consolidation will present combining entities with the challenges of remaining focused on the customer and integrating different organizations 
others in the energy industry are discontinuing operations in certain portions of the energy industry or divesting portions of their business and facilities 
the company  from time to time  performs studies and  in some cases  holds discussions regarding utility and energy related investments and transactions with other companies 
the ultimate impact on the company of any such investments and transactions that may occur cannot be determined at this time 
economic conditions the company and its subsidiaries operate in one of the fastest growing regions in the nation 
the continued prosperity of this region has allowed the company s regulated utility to expand its regulated delivery service customer base at a rate of growth well over twice the national industry average during the past five years 
in addition  this economy has provided a robust market for the company s subsidiaries to market natural gas  electricity and other energy related products and services 
a downturn in the economy of the region in which the company operates  which cannot be predicted with accuracy  might adversely affect the company s ability to grow its regulated utility and other businesses at the same rate they have grown in the past 
inflation deflation from time to time  the company s regulated utility seeks approval for rate increases from regulatory commissions to help it manage the effects of inflation on its capital investment and returns 
the most significant impact of inflation is on the regulated utility s replacement cost of plant and equipment 
while the regulatory commissions  having jurisdiction over the regulated utility s retail rates  allow depreciation only on the basis of historical cost to be recovered in rates  the company anticipates that its regulated utility should be allowed to recover the increased costs of its investment and earn a return thereon  after replacement of the facilities occurs 
to the extent the company s regulated utility experiences a sustained deflationary economic environment  actual returns on invested capital could rise and exceed returns allowed by regulators in previous regulatory proceedings 
if this were to occur  it could prompt the initiation of a regulatory review to reduce the revenue of the regulated utility 
labor contracts the company has five labor contracts with three labor unions 
the contract with international brotherhood of teamsters local is a four year contract that was ratified in june and applies to approximately members 
the contract with the office and professional employees international union opeiu  local  is a three year contract that was ratified in april and applies to approximately members 
in fiscal year  labor contracts with opeiu  local  and another smaller union that covers approximately employees will expire 
regulatory matters the regulated utility bases requests for a modification to existing rates on increased investment in plant and equipment  higher operating expenses and the need to earn an adequate return on invested capital 
until september   the regulated utility s base rates had not been modified in its major jurisdictions since the following table summarizes major rate applications and results 
summary of major rate applications and results increase in annual test year revenues millions allowed return effective months on common jurisdiction date ended requested granted equity virginia maryland a district of columbia district of columbia b virginia maryland b a rates were implemented as a result of a settlement agreement 
the return on equity indicated in the order of percent was not utilized to establish rates 
b application was settled without stipulating the return on common equity 
washington gas was granted a revenue increase in its maryland jurisdiction effective september  washington gas has also requested authority to increase its rates from the applicable regulatory agency in each of the two remaining jurisdictions where the company operates 
an order was issued on october  in the district of columbia ordering washington gas to lower revenues in this jurisdiction and on november   washington gas filed an application for reconsideration as discussed below 
washington gas filed for a rate increase in virginia that is also discussed below 
the key issues in each case are discussed below 
district of columbia jurisdiction on february   the district of columbia s office of the people s counsel opc filed a complaint with the psc of dc requesting an investigation into the reasonableness of the existing rates of washington gas 
on february   washington gas filed an answer urging the psc of dc to dismiss the opc complaint 
on march   the psc of dc issued an order granting opc s request to initiate an investigation into the reasonableness of washington gas base rates 
the psc of dc s order required washington gas to file base rate information no later than ninety days from march  on june   washington gas filed an application with the psc of dc to increase rates in the district of columbia 
the request sought to increase overall annual revenues in the district of columbia by approximately million  or percent  based on a proposed return on equity of percent 
on march   the opc filed testimony in which it recommended that the psc of dc order washington gas to reduce its rates by million  or percent 
the opc s recommendation was premised on a percent return on common equity 
the opc also recommended a one time refund of an estimated million associated with pensions and other postretirement benefits that had been collected by washington gas in accordance with a tracking mechanism approved previously by the psc of dc 
washington gas filed rebuttal testimony on april  evidentiary hearings were held the week of may  on october  the psc of dc issued an order for washington gas to decrease rates 
the order directs a decrease in overall annual revenues in the district of columbia of approximately million 
the psc of dc approved a return on common equity of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
the psc of dc rejected washington gas incentive rate plan 
the psc of dc rejected a proposal by opc seeking retroactive refunds of asset management revenues collected by washington gas in the past and approved the regulated utility s proposal to share fifty percent of such future revenues with customers 
the psc of dc also ordered washington gas to refund the pension and postretirement costs described above over three years 
because these benefits had been collected through a tracking mechanism  a liability had already been established and there will be no effect on income 
on november  washington gas filed with the psc of dc an application for reconsideration application of the order issued by the psc of dc on october  washington gas application automatically stayed the psc of dc s order 
washington gas claims that the psc of dc made calculation errors that overstated the amount of the revenue reduction by million 
washington gas also claims that the psc of dc failed to take into consideration legitimate costs and operating expenses incurred by washington gas and included in the evidentiary record of the case 
washington gas requested the psc of dc to modify its ruling to correct calculation errors and apply its articulated principles consistently with the result that washington gas would only reduce rates by million  which would allow washington gas the opportunity to earn the percent return on common equity and the percent overall rate of return authorized by the psc of dc assuming no other changes in post test period costs or expenses instead of the million reduction noted in the october  order 
on november   opc filed an application for several matters from the october  order  one of which is the retroactive refund of asset management revenues 
another intervenor in this case also filed an application 
at the present time washington gas cannot predict the outcome of the applications 
unless the psc of dc decides against washington gas on the matter of asset management revenues  the decision by the psc of dc on the applications will apply on a prospective basis from the date of the order deciding the applications for all matters 
the psc of dc has extended the time to issue a decision in this proceeding to january  maryland jurisdiction on march   washington gas filed an application with the public service commission of maryland psc of md requesting an increase in revenues of approximately million or percent 
the original request included a percent return on common equity or percent overall rate of return on a year end rate base  coupled with an incentive rate plan 
on april   the psc of md issued a ruling that established two separate phases for the purpose of considering and resolving specific issues that were stated at that time 
in phase i  the psc of md would review washington gas base rate case  its proposal regarding incentive rates and a number of other issues associated with washington gas proposed tariffs and rates 
during phase ii the psc of md would review issues regarding washington gas proposal for serving as the supplier provider of last resort for natural gas services 
on july   after discussions among all parties  an uncontested settlement agreement on phase i of the case was filed with the psc of md 
on august   hearings were held to take testimony and receive evidentiary exhibits on the narrow question of whether the proposed settlement filed on july  was in the public interest 
after evaluating the results of that day s evidence  the psc of md cancelled the scheduled contested case hearing dates 
after the august  hearing date  further discussions were held among the parties 
an uncontested revised settlement was reached on phase i of the case and filed with the psc of md on august  the revised settlement provided for an increase of million in annual non gas operating revenues 
the settlement did not indicate the allowed return on common equity for the purpose of determining the amount of the settlement 
an incentive based rate plan was not included in the settlement 
however  the parties have agreed to discuss performance standards as they may relate to an incentive rate plan within six months after the settlement is approved by the psc of md 
on september   the psc of md issued an order approving the revised settlement agreement that had been filed with the psc of md on august   without modification 
the increase in revenues became effective for meter readings of maryland customers on and after september  virginia jurisdiction on june   washington gas filed with the state corporation commission of virginia scc of va an application to increase annual revenues in virginia 
the shenandoah gas division of washington gas is included in the filing 
the filing requested to increase overall annual revenues by approximately million 
washington gas requested an overall rate of return of percent and a return on common equity of percent versus its current return on common equity of percent for washington gas and percent for shenandoah gas 
washington gas also requested approval of an incentive rate plan  which includes a sharing between customers and washington gas of weather normalized virginia regulated earnings basis points above or below the scc of va s authorized return on equity 
the incentive rate plan proposed no change in the method of recovering the cost of natural gas incurred by washington gas 
under the regulations of the scc of va  washington gas placed the entire amount of the requested revenue increase into effect on november   subject to refund pending the scc of va s final decision in the proceeding 
the collection of increased revenues and the contingent liability for refunds will impact future financial results 
thus there is no provision for rate refunds as of september  on november   the staff of the scc of va staff filed testimony in this proceeding in response to washington gas presentation 
the staff took the position that washington gas revenues are sufficient and do not need to be revised  but recommended that operating revenues for the shenandoah gas division be decreased by million 
the staff s estimate of the cost of equity for washington gas  including the shenandoah division  was a range between percent and percent 
the staff recommends the scc of va adopt a percent return on equity for washington gas including the shenandoah division 
washington gas filed rebuttal testimony in this proceeding on december  hearings were held the week of december  washington gas cannot predict the outcome of this pending regulatory proceeding 
in a separate  but related matter  in accordance with an order of the scc of va  washington gas performed a depreciation study  using data as of december  and an update as of december   to determine the adequacy of the current depreciation rates that washington gas uses to record depreciation expense for property located in its virginia jurisdiction 
washington gas submitted the study to the staff in the first quarter of fiscal year since that time  washington gas and the staff have had several informal discussions regarding the depreciation rates included in the originally submitted study and the effective date that should be used for recording depreciation expense utilizing any new rates 
staff issued a letter dated october  approving new depreciation rates for washington gas and the shenandoah gas division  which would increase the annual depreciation expense by approximately million 
the staff stated its position that the approved rates should be implemented as of january   but recognized that the implementation date will ultimately be decided by the scc of va in the pending rate case discussed above 
washington gas believes the new depreciation rates should be implemented coincident with the effective date of the new base rates  which is the implementation date  november   of the interim rates that are subject to refund 
the financial statements as of and for the periods ended september  do not reflect any modification of depreciation rates that washington gas has been utilizing since it last received formal approval of depreciation rates by the scc of va 
to the extent the position of the staff is upheld by the scc of va in the current rate case  without appropriate revenue relief  washington gas would have to record a charge to income for additional depreciation expense calculated from january  to november   without a corresponding amount of revenue 
environmental matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to various laws related to environmental matters  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
market risk price risk related to retail energy marketing operations the company s subsidiary  wgeservices  markets both natural gas and electricity 
in the course of its business  wgeservices makes fixed price or index price sales commitments to customers 
wgeservices purchases the corresponding physical supplies at prices to lock in margins 
wgeservices has exposure to changes in gas prices related to the volumetric differences between the purchase commitments and sales commitments 
wgeservices manages the risk associated with gas price fluctuations by closely matching purchases from suppliers with sales commitments to customers 
historically  the responsibility for managing daily demand fluctuations from wgeservices customers resulting from variability in weather was assumed by wgl holdings regulated utility subsidiary through the use of its storage and peaking capacity 
the regulated utility charged wgeservices a fee for this service 
effective april   wgeservices assumed a major portion of the responsibility to deliver the appropriate level of gas to its customers on a daily basis 
wgeservices will continue to be able to avail itself of certain peak shaving capacity that the regulated utility provides for a fee and also has acquired a pro rata portion of the utility s storage gas capacity to manage its load 
therefore  variations in demand caused by fluctuations in weather applicable to approximately percent of wgeservices annual sales volumes could result in wgeservices having contracted for more or less gas than its customers require on any given day 
as a result  wgeservices has modified its risk management and procurement policies to reflect the need to obtain storage capacity and other contractual arrangements to meet the weather related variability in its demand and to ensure the financial exposure caused by this variability in demand is adequately controlled 
as part of managing this exposure wgeservices purchases options in accordance with its risk management policy 
the option value is marked to market in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
wgeservices also has a wholesale supplier credit policy that is designed to mitigate wholesale credit risks in the current energy environment 
wgeservices measures the market risk of its energy marketing portfolio and employs risk control mechanisms to mitigate market risk including value at risk 
value at risk simulates forward price curves in the energy markets to estimate the size and probability of future losses 
wgeservices value at risk as of september  was million  while the value of the open position was million 
weather risk in october  washington gas purchased a weather insurance policy in order to reduce the impact of warmer than normal weather on financial results 
the policy has a five year term that ends september  the policy covers a portion of washington gas s estimated net revenue exposure to variations in heating degree days hdds 
the insurance policy defines a heating degree day as the greater of i degrees fahrenheit less the average of the daily high and daily low temperatures in degrees fahrenheit as measured at washington reagan national airport  or ii zero 
for insurance policy purposes  neither average temperatures nor hdds are rounded 
income is provided in the amount of  for each such hdd below  per fiscal year up to a maximum of hdds  subject to certain limitations 
during fiscal  weather was percent warmer than normal  resulting in hdds that were covered by the policy 
as a result  washington gas recorded pre tax income in fiscal year and received a payment of million in october  offsetting about percent of the estimated financial impact of the year s warmer than normal weather 
the policy s pre tax annual premium cost was million for fiscal years and a further description of the accounting for weather insurance may be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
over the five year term of the policy  washington gas cannot be paid for more than  hdds 
of the remaining hdds at september   are available to cover lower impact  higher frequency warm weather conditions between  hdds and  hdds in a given year and are available to cover severely warm weather between  hdds and  hdds in a given year 
additionally  if over the five year term of the policy the hdds average less than  per year  washington gas will receive an additional payment of approximately million at the end of the five year policy term  reduced for certain interim payments if warm weather occurs before the policy expires 
washington gas has performed extensive simulation analyses indicating that the annual net cash outlay for the policy premiums paid less all benefits received should average  after tax per year over the remaining three year period 
actual year by year cash flows may vary due to policy design and actual weather conditions 
when washington gas reports heating degree days  it computes hdds in a method different from that used for insurance policy purposes 
washington gas method rounds the average of the high and low temperatures to the nearest whole degree prior to subtracting that average from degrees 
as a result  for each fiscal year in the five year policy period  the number of hdds computed for insurance purposes will almost certainly be greater than the number of hdds reported by washington gas 
therefore  the insurance policy computation will indicate colder weather than washington gas s computation  and the annual benefit received will be lower than might be expected if washington gas s measure of hdds were used 
for example  last fiscal year s hdd total for insurance purposes was  but was  under washington gas s method 
interest rate risk exposure related to other financial instruments at september   the regulated utility had fixed rate mtns and other long term debt aggregating million in principal amount  excluding current maturities  and having a fair value of million 
fair value is defined as the present value of the debt securities future cash flows discounted at interest rates that reflect market conditions as of september  while these are fixed rate instruments and  therefore  do not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates  they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change 
a total of million  or approximately percent of the regulated utility s outstanding mtns  have call options that enable the regulated utility to mitigate this market risk through the early redemption of those debt instruments 
likewise  a total of million  or percent of the regulated utility s outstanding mtns  have put options that allow the holders of debt to mitigate market risk through the early redemption of those debt instruments 
using sensitivity analyses to measure this market risk exposure  the regulated utility estimates that the fair value of its long term debt would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by percent 
the company also estimates that the fair value of its long term debt would decrease by approximately million if interest rates were to increase by percent 
in general  such an increase or decrease in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity
