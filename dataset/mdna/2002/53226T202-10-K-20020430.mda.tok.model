item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 
except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our future results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include risks detailed in part i  item i under the caption risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we were founded in on the philosophy of using technology to increase student achievement by connecting the school to the home 
we develop  market and sell curriculum based educational software and fee based subscription internet products and services used both in school and at home 
our curriculum based educational software consists of our lightspan achieve now and academic software 
lightspan achieve now is our media rich  interactive cd rom based software for students in schools in kindergarten through eighth grade that covers the core curriculum of language arts  reading and math 
our technology  delivery system and content help increase student interest in learning  parental involvement in their children s education  and productive interaction among teachers  parents and students 
our academic software is also cd rom based and serves the college market with an english and mathematics curriculum designed to meet the needs of under prepared college students 
our fee based subscription internet products consist of the lightspan network  which provides curriculum based content correlated to state academic standards  and the lightspan reading center  which is a complete online reading program that supports student achievement and helps educators make more informed instructional decisions 
assessment products are offered through lightspan edutest assessment  with proprietary test questions  covering language arts  mathematics and science  allowing educators to assess their students progress in the classroom 
the results can be analyzed at the school district and school levels  and the classroom 
our products and services are sold to school districts by a direct field sales force  our internal sales organization and supported by our professional development team who assist in implementing our curricula in schools 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to utilize accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe policies and estimates related to revenue recognition  intangible assets and allowance for doubtful accounts represent our critical accounting policies 
future results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition software license revenue 
we recognize revenue from license agreements when a non cancelable  non contingent license agreement has been signed  the software product has been delivered  no uncertainties exist surrounding product acceptance  fees from the agreement are fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
in software arrangements that include multiple elements  such as those that include rights to software products  customer support and product implementation and training services  lightspan allocates the total fee to each component of the arrangement based on objective evidence of its fair value  which is specific to lightspan 
the objective evidence for each element is based on the sale price of each element when sold or offered for sale separately 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 

table of contents internet subscriptions 
revenue derived from fee based internet subscriptions is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  generally one year 
professional services 
revenue derived from professional services  including product implementation and customer training is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue derived from telephone support and maintenance arrangements provided by the professional development organization is recognized ratably over the term of the support and maintenance period  generally one year 
we recognize our revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commissions sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab and the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is consistent with this guidance and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  the accounting profession continues to discuss various provisions of these guidelines with the objective of providing additional guidance on their future application 
these discussions and the issuance of new interpretations  once finalized  could lead to unanticipated changes in recognized revenue 
they could also drive significant adjustments to our business practices that could result in increased administrative costs  lengthened sales cycles and other changes that could affect our results of operations 
effective february   we adopted sop  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which caused a substantial change in the timing of when revenue was recognized for lightspan achieve now licenses 
under sop  we were unable to recognize any lightspan achieve now license fees as revenue until we shipped the final title which we planned to provide to all existing customers for no additional charge 
therefore  we deferred the recognition of revenue for all lightspan achieve now licenses shipped in the years ended january  and by april   we had completed and shipped all lightspan achieve now titles in all grade clusters used on the playstation game console and grade cluster k through used on a pc platform  resulting in the recognition in the first quarter of fiscal of million of revenue previously deferred 
by july   we had completed and shipped all remaining lightspan achieve now titles used on a pc platform  resulting in the recognition in the second quarter of fiscal of the remaining million of revenue previously deferred 
subsequent to july   we did not defer revenue relating to lightspan achieve now licenses that were shipped as we had completed the development of all lightspan achieve now titles 
to the extent that we deferred the lightspan achieve now license revenue until delivery of final titles  pursuant to sop  we also deferred the costs of duplicating the product and packaging it for distribution 
in the three months ended april   we recognized million in cost of license revenue when we recognized the related million in revenue 
in the three months ended july   we recognized million in cost of license revenue when we recognized the related million in revenue 
the following table shows the activity in software license revenue and associated cost of revenue deferred pursuant to sop for the years ended january  and  respectively in thousands years ended january  deferred license revenue achieve now beginning balance deferred during the period recognized during the period ending balance deferred cost of license revenue achieve now beginning balance deferred during the period recognized during the period ending balance 
table of contents intangible assets we assess the potential for impairment of our goodwill based on the provisions of sfas in assessing impairment  we made assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill or impairment thereof 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill not previously recorded 
for the year ended january   the company did not record any impairment loss related to goodwill 
the company will apply sfas beginning in the first quarter of fiscal beginning in that quarter  we will reclassify an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of million to goodwill at the date of adoption and will no longer amortize goodwill  thereby eliminating subject to future impairment charges what would otherwise be an annual goodwill amortization of approximately million 
in accordance with sfas the company will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we will complete an initial goodwill impairment assessment during the first six months of fiscal to determine if an impairment charge should be recognized under sfas we cannot predict at this time whether a material impairment charge will be recorded 
our intangible assets were acquired as a result of our acquisitions of academic and global schoolhouse in september  studyweb in october and edutest in june  and represent customer base  acquired technology  trademarks and trade names 
these intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets 
lightspan continually evaluates the recoverability of the intangible assets and considers any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
any material changes in circumstances could require future write downs of our intangible assets and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the periods in which such write downs occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  historical losses and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
should a customer s account become past due  we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
additionally  our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
results of operations operating losses 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception and  as of january   have accumulated losses of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
in july  we recorded a million restructuring charge related to a refocus of our sales and marketing efforts from our free internet products towards our fee based subscription internet products 
in addition  in july  we completed and shipped the remaining lightspan achieve now titles used on a pc platform and the playstation game console  recognizing million during the first two quarters of fiscal year ended july  in revenue previously deferred pursuant to sop  resulting in an operating loss of million for the year ended january  fiscal 
the operating results in fiscal are not indicative of our underlying business in that year  and are not indicative of results that may be expected for the foreseeable future

table of contents income taxes at january   lightspan had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively 
the difference between the federal and california tax loss carryforwards is primarily attributable to capitalization of research expenses and limitations on net operating losses for california tax purposes 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in unless previously utilized 
through january   california tax loss carryforwards of million have expired  and additional loss carryforwards will continue to expire in fiscal a valuation allowance has been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets because management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized

liquidity and capital resources from inception through january  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily from the net proceeds from private sales of equity securities  net proceeds from our initial public offering and the collection of revenues from the sales of our products and services 
currently  we are not generating sufficient revenue to fund our operations 
we expect our operating losses and net operating cash outflows to continue if we are unable to increase sales 
if we are unable to sufficiently increase our revenues  our ability to service and maintain our products or fund our operations could be significantly impaired 
at january   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and million in restricted cash for a total of million 
the expansion of our business will require the use of our capital to fund operating losses  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and may continue to incur losses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
our working capital has fluctuated significantly since our inception 
this is due  in large part  to the timing of cash payments to vendors  cash collections from customers  varying resources required for development efforts on our product offerings  as well as receipt of cash from our preferred stock financings  initial public offering  private placements and other equity offerings 
we expect our working capital requirements and cash position to fluctuate significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future for the same reasons 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used during these periods was primarily to fund technology and development  sales and marketing  including promotion of lightspan

table of contents our future capital requirements will depend on a variety of factors  including market acceptance of our products and services and the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products 
we expect to devote capital resources in connection with  marketing  promotional activities  maintaining and selling our existing products and services  and continued development  expansion and maintenance of our existing software and internet product offerings and content 
in addition  we may devote substantial capital resources to strategic acquisitions and relationships 
as of january   we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least the next months

recently issued accounting standards in june  fasb issued statement of financial accounting statement  or sfas  no 
 business combinations sfas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas  effective june   requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the pooling of interests method of accounting can no longer be used for business combinations completed after june  the provisions of sfas are similar to prior generally accepted accounting principles gaap  although sfas requires additional disclosures for transactions occurring after the effective date 
we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill for business combinations completed after june  effective february   goodwill will no longer be amortized  but is required to be assessed on an annual basis for impairment at the reporting unit level with a charge recorded as appropriate by applying a fair value based test 
sfas also provides additional guidance on acquired intangibles that should be separately recognized and amortized  which may result in the recognition of additional intangible assets as compared with prior gaap 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we will reclassify an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of million to goodwill at the date of adoption and will no longer amortize goodwill  thereby eliminating subject to future impairment charges what would otherwise be an annual goodwill amortization of approximately million 
unamortized goodwill was million as of january  we will complete an initial goodwill impairment assessment during the first six months of fiscal to determine if an impairment charge should be recognized under sfas we cannot predict at this time whether a material impairment charge will be recorded 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
this statement becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of sfas no 
is not currently expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  in that it removes goodwill from its impairment scope and allows for different approaches in cash flow estimation 
however  sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
also supercedes the business segment concept in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  in that it permits presentation of a component of an entity  whether classified as held for sale or disposed of  as a discontinued operation 
however  sfas no 
retains the requirement of apb opinion no 
to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations 
this statement becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with earlier application encouraged 
we believe that the implementation of this standard will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to our various outstanding debt instruments 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to the interest rates which are tied to market rates  and our investments in interest sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes and do not expect to in the future 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in securities rated aa or better 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at january  or declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income
