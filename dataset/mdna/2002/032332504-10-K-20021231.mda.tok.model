item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations amtech develops  manufactures  markets and services a range of semiconductor wafer manufacturing and semiconductor fabrication equipment and related parts  supplies and services on a worldwide basis 
the products offered are grouped into two segments the semiconductor equipment segment  which offers horizontal diffusion furnaces  processing robotic equipment for diffusion furnaces and services to semiconductor manufacturers  and the polishing supplies segment  which offers supplies  including carriers and templates  and equipment for lapping and polishing  which are some of the last steps in the manufacture of silicon wafers 
demand for amtech s products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including  but not limited to  changes in global and regional economic conditions  supply and demand for semiconductors or  more specifically  capacity utilization and production volume of manufacturers of semiconductors  silicon wafers  solar cells and optical components  and the profitability of semiconductor manufacturers 
for this and other reasons  amtech s results of operations for fiscal  and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with amtech s consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
revenues 
amtech s total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  was million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in and a increase in the following table reflects the consolidated new orders  net of cancellations  shipments  revenues and backlog as of the beginning and end of the three fiscal years ended september   as well as for amtech s two business segments

sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
amounts prior to fiscal have not been restated 
the deferred revenue included in the cumulative effect of the change in the revenue recognition accounting policy as of october  was million  which accounts for the difference between the backlog as of the end of and the beginning of the backlogs as of september  and included deferred revenue of million and million  respectively 
new orders are net of cancellations 
amtech s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal  and as a result of these conditions  there were significant fluctuations in amtech s quarterly new orders and net sales  both within and across fiscal years 
demand for semiconductor and silicon wafer manufacturing equipment and related consumable products has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in semiconductor supply and demand and other factors in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
the semiconductor equipment segment accounted for  and of amtech s revenues and  and of amtech s operating income in  and  respectively 
the semiconductor and optical component industries cycle peaked during fiscal as a result of the rapid decline in the demand in for semiconductor devices and due to inventory buildups in telecommunications products  slower than expected personal computer sales and overall slower global economic growth  many semiconductor manufacturers reevaluated their capital spending plans 
accordingly  amtech experienced cancellation of existing orders by customers in fiscal and rescheduled deliveries and a significant decline in new orders during and during the fourth fiscal quarter of  amtech implemented the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
amounts prior to fiscal have not been restated 
pursuant to the guidance provided in sab  at least some portion of each system sale in the semiconductor equipment segment is deferred 
some of the more significant factors that can affect the length of time from shipment to full revenue recognition are customer delays in site preparation  the time it takes for the customer to obtain local permits  delays by other vendors in the installation of equipment with which amtech s products must interface and the availability of our technicians 
because the selling price of systems generally range between  and million  these factors significantly affect the timing of revenue recognition from customer to customer and system to system  which increases the volatility of revenue 
revenues for the polishing supplies segment generally are not subject to deferral as there is no customer holdback or post shipment obligations  other than warranty 
revenue of the polishing supplies segment reached a record million in fiscal  as the semiconductor industry reached the peak of the business cycle 
by march  orders in the polishing supplies segment began a steep decline  reflecting excess supply inventories and capacity of that segment s customers 
the polishing supplies segment suffered a dramatic decrease in revenues  declining from million in fiscal to million in and million in  representing a decrease of in and in during fiscal  new orders reached a record million as the semiconductor industry was reaching the peak of the cycle that began in the previous year 
during fiscal  slowing worldwide demand for semiconductors resulted in a rapid decrease in demand for manufacturing equipment 
inventory buildups in telecommunication products  slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth caused semiconductor companies to reevaluate their capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders 
this decline in demand worsened throughout the remainder of fiscal and  resulting in a severe industry downturn due to continued weakness in the macro economic climate and consumption of electronic goods  which translated into further capital spending cutbacks by semiconductor manufacturers 
revenues of the semiconductor equipment segment increased in to million from million in and remained at that higher level in by january  amtech began to see signs of the downturn  resulting in the first of several order cancellations in the semiconductor equipment segment 
during and  new orders in the semiconductor equipment segment declined by and  respectively  due to the downturn in the industry 
however  the shipments  like the revenues of the semiconductor equipment segment  increased in fiscal by despite the decline in orders  as amtech worked off a part of the large backlog that had built up in the million of revenue deferred from prior periods as a part of the cumulative effect adjustment for the accounting change in revenue recognition further increased the backlog as of october  in  the semiconductor segment experienced a decrease in shipments of million  or  to million 
revenues of the semiconductor equipment segment remained at million in  as the decline in shipments was offset by the increase in the revenues recognized on the completion or acceptance of systems  which had previously been deferred due to customer holdbacks or other contingencies 
due to the continued weakness in both the optical component market  to which amtech had substantial shipments in fiscal and  but none in  and the much larger semiconductor market  current outlook is for continued lower revenues in at least the first half of fiscal however  quarterly consolidated shipments appear to have stabilized and even recovered slightly from the million level of the second quarter of fiscal and the semiconductor equipment segment continues to have a significant backlog  leading management to believe that revenue for fiscal may not be any lower than in fiscal in  and   and  respectively  of amtech s total revenue was attributable to sales outside of the united states 
each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause  and in the past have caused  capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net revenue for the three fiscal years ended september  fiscal years ended september  net revenue cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development operating income 
gross margins 
consolidated gross margin for the fiscal year ended september  was million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million  or  in  and an increase of 
million  or  in fiscal in fiscal  the gross margin of the semiconductor equipment segment decreased by million  or  primarily due to approximately 
million in inventory write offs taken in response to the continued decline in the semiconductor industry worldwide and a customer s decision to sell a plant from which future orders had been expected 
other factors contributing to the decline in the gross margins of the semiconductor equipment segment included learning curve and development costs incurred on customer orders for new products  ie mm diffusion furnace and related automation and s models with cassette to cassette capability and interfaces to smif pod openers and factory automation with secs ii gem  and 
million in increased labor costs 
the gross margin of the polishing supplies segment declined by million  or  in fiscal due to the decrease in sales volume and the semi fixed and fixed nature of labor and overhead costs  which did not decline at the same rate as revenue 
in fiscal  the gross margin of the semiconductor equipment segment increased  due to increased sales volume 
however  the gross margin of the polishing supplies segment declined  offsetting approximately two thirds of the increase contributed by the semiconductor equipment segment 
as a percentage of revenue  the consolidated gross margin was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  and in write downs of excess or obsolete inventory of 
million in  compared to 
million in and 
million in contributed to the decline in gross margins as a percentage of revenue in and other factors contributing to the decline in gross margin as a percentage of revenue were product mix in both years and learning curve costs in of the semiconductor segment  underabsorption of factory expenses in the polishing supplies segment and competitive pricing pressure of both segments 
amtech s gross margin has significantly fluctuated in the past and will continue to fluctuate based on several factors including the severity and duration of the current industry downturn  revenue recognition under sab  product mix and overhead absorption levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in and million in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable was approximately 
million higher in fiscal than in fiscal and 
million higher than in  primarily due to a major customer in the optical component industry filing for bankruptcy in commissions expense decreased by 
million in due to the decrease in shipments in the semiconductor equipment segment and by 
million in due to the lower sales volume in polishing supplies segment 
costs associated with implementing new data processing systems also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses in and the decline in such costs in cost cutting measures reduced selling and administrative personnel costs by approximately 
million in and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue remained relatively constant during the three year period  ranging in and declining to in fiscal research and development expenses 
during fiscal years  and amtech s expenditures accounted for as research and development were 
million  
million and 
million  respectively 
during all three fiscal years  the most significant project included in research and development expenses has been the development of a new technology asher pursuant to a joint product development agreement with psk tech 
the cause for the decline in research and development costs in fiscal compared to fiscal is that most of our equipment contribution to the initial stage of the joint asher development project were made in fiscal the decline in is the result of reduced spending on new controls for the tempress r diffusion furnace and research and development grants in the netherlands 
the results of the feasibility work on the new technology asher with psk tech are encouraging 
the next step will be to develop a prototype of a mm asher  using amtech s damage free technology  and a similar machine for a beta site at one of amtech s customers 
amech and psk tech have agreed to time the procurement  assembly and testing of both machines in order to match a customer s advanced technology schedule  which amtech understands calls for testing to begin in approximately november the combined cost of those two machines is estimated to be approximately million  but the relative contributions of amtech and psk tech to that stage of the project have not been established 
however  amtech s contribution to the project could cause its research and development expenses to increase significantly starting as early as approximately november significant projects completed in included the development of two new models of automation  which were the s and e in  the company completed the development of a mm diffusion furnace and related automation and s models with cassette to cassette capability and interfaces to smif pod openers and factory automation with secs ii gem 
however  a portion of those costs are incurred while completing customer orders and are charged  along with other costs of the order  to cost of sales and therefore not included in the research and development expenses 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal year was 
million  or less than of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in fiscal  and million  or of revenue  in operating income declined in due primarily to the decline in revenues and related gross margin in the polishing supplies segment and the lower gross margin of the semiconductor equipment segment  as explained above 
the decline in operating income in was due to increased selling  general and administrative expenses  primarily the 
million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts 
operating income as a percent of revenue declined in and primarily as a result of the decline in gross margins as a percent of sales  discussed above 
interest income net 
net interest income was 
million in fiscal  compared to 
million in fiscal and 
million in fiscal the decrease in net interest income in is the result of substantially lower interest rates  while the increase in was a result of investing the funds from the september private placement 
income tax provision 
during fiscal  and  amtech recorded income tax provisions of 
million  
million and 
million  respectively 
the effective rate stated as a percentage of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of the change in revenue recognition accounting principle was  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the significantly lower effective tax in fiscal is a result of the fact that more than all of the consolidated operating profit was earned in the netherlands where there is no state income tax rate 
in addition  a state income tax benefit arose from operating losses in the united states 
amtech s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of the pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies 
net income 
net income for fiscal  and  respectively  was 
million  
million and million 
net income per diluted share was  
and 
in fiscal  and  respectively 
on a pro forma basis  with the change in the revenue recognition accounting principle being applied retroactively  net income per diluted share was  
and 
in fiscal  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources as of september  and  cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively 
amtech s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was and at september  and  respectively 
amtech generated cash from operations in each of the last three fiscal years as follows million  million and million 
in each of these fiscal years  investing activities consisted of software  computers and equipment purchases and building improvements 
financing activities provided million  
million and million in  and  respectively 
in  financing activities consisted mainly of the proceeds from stock options exercised and in  the financing income came from a private placement of common stock 
at september   amtech s principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents 
since the only lien on the company s assets is a 
million mortgage loan  management believes that significant amounts of additional liquidity is available from various financing sources 
amtech believes that it has sufficient liquidity for current operations and for at least certain elements of its growth strategy 
one element of that strategy is the development of new products such as the proposed new technology asher 
another is the acquisition of product lines or businesses that complement the company s existing business 
amtech s currently available cash and short term investments are expected to be sufficient for existing operations  planned research and development and possibly an acquisition  depending on size 
however  significant unplanned development of new products  or larger acquisitions may require additional capital resources that are expected to be obtained from one or more sources of financing  such as a private placement  a public offering  working capital loans or term loans from banks or other financial institutions  equipment leasing  mortgage financing and internally generated cash flow from operations 
there can be no assurance of the availability or sufficiency of these or any other source of funding for those purposes 
commitments key suppliers include two steel mills  one domestic and one german  capable of meeting the material specification the company requires 
as of september   the company had unconditional commitments to purchase 
million of steel  with delivery dates to be determined in the future 
due to minimum order quantities for this steel and long lead times  the company has made purchase commitments that may be in excess of future production requirements  and it could take several years to use all of the steel commitments in production of the company s products 
these purchase commitments are not expected to result in any significant losses 
the company leases buildings  vehicles and equipment 
as of september   minimum rental commitments under noncancellable operating leases total  of which   and  are payable in fiscal years  and  respectively 
change in accounting principle revenue recognition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its revenue recognition policy retroactive to october   based on guidance provided in securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfers  generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain of the company s product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
for the semiconductor equipment segment  if the company has met defined customer specifications with similarly situated customers and the specific equipment and process involved  the company recognizes equipment revenue upon shipment and transfer of title  with the remainder when it becomes due  generally upon acceptance 
product sales that are shipped but do not meet these criteria are deferred and recognized upon customer acceptance 
equipment sold by the polishing supplies segment does not involve process guarantees or acceptance criteria  so the related revenue is recorded upon shipment 
for all segments  sales of spare parts and consumables are recognized upon shipment 
service revenues are recognized as services are performed 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized upon performance of the services requested by the customer 
in accordance with guidance provided in sab  the company recorded a non cash charge of  after reduction for income taxes of  or per basic share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
the deferred profit balance as of the beginning of fiscal was  this amount is the deferred revenue net of the related cost of sales for equipment that was shipped and previously recorded as sales but had not been accepted or did not qualify for multiple element accounting as of september  of the  in deferred profit as of the beginning of fiscal   and  was recognized in and  respectively 
the pro forma amounts presented on the consolidated statements of operations were calculated assuming the accounting change was retroactively adopted as of october  prior to fiscal  the company s revenue recognition policy was to recognize revenue and accrue the estimated installation costs at the time the customer took title to the product  generally at the time of shipment because the company routinely met its installation obligations and installation costs represented a small percentage of total costs approximately 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation allowances for inventory and accounts receivable  warranty and impairment of long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making conclusions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the sec suggests that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfers  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain of the company s product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
for the semiconductor equipment segment  if the company has met defined customer specifications with similarly situated customers  equipment and processes  the company recognizes equipment revenue upon shipment and transfer of title  and the holdback portion of the revenue that is contingent upon installation and acceptance  generally of a system s selling price  is deferred until those activities are completed 
revenues for products that are shipped but do not meet this criteria are deferred and recognized when the equipment and processes are proven  generally upon customer acceptance or upon obtaining customer acceptance on at least two similar systems 
collection of the holdback portion of a system sale is often based on system acceptance or final installation 
we have  on occasion  experienced longer than expected delays in receiving cash from certain customers pending system acceptance or final installation 
if some of our customers were to refuse to pay the remaining holdback  or otherwise delay final acceptance or installation  the deferred revenue would not be recognized  adversely affecting future operating results 
equipment sold by the polishing supplies segment does not include process guarantees or acceptance criteria  so the related revenue is recorded upon shipment 
for all segments  sales of spare parts and consumables are recognized upon shipment  as there are no post shipment obligations other than standard warranties 
service revenues are recognized upon performance of the services requested by the customer 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized as the services requested by the customer are performed 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down for excess and obsolete inventory 
the provision is primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
however  our industry is characterized by customers in highly cyclical industries  rapid technological changes  frequent new product developments and rapid product obsolescence 
during and  there was a significant decrease in the worldwide demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
demand for our products has fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future  which could result in an increase in the cost of inventory or an increase in excess inventory quantities on hand 
the company s ratio of inventories to operating levels is above  and is expected to remain above  the historic norms of our business due to order cancellations and the deferral of orders by customers 
there can be no assurance that future developments will not necessitate further write downs 
valuation allowance for accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on historical experience  credit evaluations and specific customer collection issues we have identified 
since our accounts receivable are often concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
warranty 
the company provides a limited warranty  generally twelve to twenty four months  to all purchasers of its new products and systems 
a provision for the estimated cost of providing warranty coverage is recorded upon shipment of all systems 
on occasion  we have been required and may be required in the future to provide additional warranty coverage to ensure that the systems are ultimately accepted or to maintain customer goodwill 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and management believes that the amounts accrued for warranty expenditures are sufficient for all systems sold through september   we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience a similar level of predictability with regard to warranty costs we have in the past 
in addition  technological changes or previously unknown defects in raw materials or components may result in more extensive and frequent warranty service than anticipated  which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the periods in which such additional costs materialize 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the estimated useful lives of long lived assets or intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted net cash flows generated by the asset over the remaining estimated life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
we make judgments and estimates used in establishing the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets 
those judgments and estimates could be modified if adverse changes occurred in the future resulting in an inability to recover the carrying value of these assets 
we have not experienced any impairment to long lived assets during fiscal or fiscal future adverse changes could be caused by  among other factors  a continued downturn in the semiconductor industry  a general economic slowdown  reduced demand for our products in the market place  poor operating results  inability to protect intellectual property or changing technologies and product obsolescence 
accounting prounouncements not yet adopted in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no

sfas no 
requires the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and at least an annual assessment of whether there has been an impairment of such assets that needs to be recognized as an impairment charge 
effective as of october   amtech will adopt sfas nos 
and since amortization of goodwill is currently  per year  the discontinuation of such amortization will not have a material affect on amtech s results of operations or financial condition

trends  risks and uncertainties if demand for horizontal diffusion furnaces and related equipment declines  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the revenue of our semiconductor equipment segment  which accounts for approximately three quarters of consolidated revenues  is comprised of sales of horizontal diffusion furnaces and our processing robotic product line 
our processing robotic product line is useable only with horizontal diffusion furnaces 
there is a trend in the semiconductor industry  related to the trend to produce smaller chips  toward the use in semiconductor manufacturing facilities of newer technology  such as vertical diffusion furnaces 
vertical diffusion furnaces are more efficient to use than the horizontal diffusion furnaces in certain manufacturing processes of smaller chips on larger wafers 
because of this trend  we had expected that demand for our horizontal diffusion furnaces would decline 
we believe this trend has not adversely affected us yet primarily because we have experienced increased demand from manufacturers that do not require the more expensive vertical furnaces  such as from manufacturers of wireless communication chips and micro controllers used in a number of consumer applications  and we believe that because of improvements in automation for horizontal diffusion furnaces  such as our robotic product line  horizontal diffusion furnaces may be becoming a more favorable alternative to the vertical furnaces than they previously had been  and we are pursuing alternative markets  such as solar cell manufacturers and research and development facilities  which accounted for million and  respectively  of revenues in however  to the extent that the trend to use vertical diffusion furnaces over horizontal diffusion furnaces continues  our revenues may decline and our corresponding ability to generate income may be adversely affected 
the ongoing volatility of the semiconductor equipment industry may negatively impact our business and results of operations and our corresponding ability to efficiently budget our expenses 
the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical 
the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both their domestic markets and the semiconductor industry worldwide 
the timing  length and severity of the up and down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict 
this cyclical nature of our marketplace affects our ability to accurately budget our expense levels  which are based in part on our projections of future revenues 
when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels  operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound 
during a down cycle  we must be able to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions 
in addition  during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand 
we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles 
if we fail to respond to industry cycles  our business could be seriously harmed 
during the most recent down cycle  beginning in the first half of fiscal  the semiconductor industry experienced excess production capacity that caused semiconductor manufacturers to decrease capital spending 
we do not have long term volume production contracts with our customers and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers 
whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products and the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control 
insufficient orders will result in under utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure and will negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on key personnel for our business development  product development and sales  and any loss of our key personnel to competitors or other industries could dramatically impact our ability to continue operations 
amtech is the beneficiary of a life insurance policy on the life of mr 
whang in the amount of  but there is no assurance that such amount will be sufficient to cover the cost of finding and hiring a suitable replacement for mr 
whang 
it may not be feasible for any successor to maintain the same business relationships that mr 
whang has established 
if we were to lose the services of mr 
whang for any reason  it could have a material adverse affect on our business 
in addition  historically  our product development has been accomplished through cooperative efforts with two key customers 
our relationship with one of these customers as well as with our joint development partner for the new technology asher  are substantially dependent on the personal relations established by mr 
whang 
while there can be no assurance that such relationships will continue  such cooperation is expected to continue to be a significant element in our future development efforts 
we also depend on the management efforts of our officers and other key personnel and on the ability to attract new key personnel and retain existing key personnel 
most of our products  other than the atmoscan r and products acquired in the pr hoffman acquisition  were developed by our own personnel 
we presently employ three engineers  including one with a phd  and one in the sales department at our tempe  arizona plant 
we employ six engineers  including one with a phd  in our netherlands operation 
these employees design and support the horizontal diffusion furnace and conveyor furnace product lines manufactured in the netherlands and the related process robotic products manufactured in tempe 
two engineers are employed in our carlisle  pennsylvania operation 
they design wafer lapping machines and carriers to meet customers processing requirements 
competition is intense for highly skilled employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel or that we can avoid increased costs in order to do so 
there can be no assurance that employees will not leave amtech or compete against us 
our failure to attract additional qualified employees or to retain the services of key personnel could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology we use in our products 
success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends  in part  on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions 
for example  the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size of semiconductor devices 
these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs 
technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing 
our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products or uses for existing products that successfully address changing customer needs  win market acceptance of these new products or uses and manufacture any new products in a timely and cost effective manner 
if we do not develop and introduce new products  technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our business could be seriously harmed 
our results of operations may be materially harmed if we are unable to recoup our investment in research and development 
the rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our products and to keep pace with competitive products and satisfy customer demands for improved performance  features and functionality 
there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development 
research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product  and not all development activities result in commercially viable products 
in addition  we cannot ensure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us 
our business could be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if our products are not accepted by the market in which we operate 
our current capitalization could delay  defer or prevent a change of control 
we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock and up to  shares of preferred stock 
as of december   there were  shares outstanding 
authorized but unissued common stock may be issued for such consideration as the board of directors determines to be adequate 
the board of directors may issue preferred stock with such rights and preferences as they determine  without shareholder vote 
although we do not currently intend to issue any shares of our preferred stock there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future 
shareholders may or may not be given the opportunity to vote thereon  depending upon the nature of any such transactions  applicable law  the rules and policies of the national securities exchange on which the common stock is then trading  if any  and the judgment of the board of directors 
shareholders have no preemptive rights to subscribe for newly issued shares of our capital stock

the rights issuance was adopted as protection against a takeover by a third party 
mr 
whang and certain other key employees have severance arrangements that require amtech to make significant lump sum payments in the event of a change of control in ownership 
having the outstanding rights  and a substantial number of authorized and unreserved shares of common stock  preferred stock and severance arrangements with key employees could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
management could use the additional shares to resist a takeover effort even if the terms of the takeover offer are favored by a majority of the independent shareholders 
this could delay  defer  or prevent a change in control 
if third parties violate our proprietary rights  in which we have made significant investment  or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights  such events could result in loss of the value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation 
our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights 
we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies 
the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive  and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents  or that  issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us 
other companies and individuals  including our larger competitors  may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own 
we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
however  we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 
while patent  copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important  we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants and through other security measures 
we also rely on trade secret protection for our technology  in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties 
we also maintain exclusive and non exclusive licenses with third parties for the technology used in certain products 
however  these employees  consultants and third parties may breach these agreements  and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing 
in addition  the laws of certain territories in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products  processes  technologies or information 
in such cases  we evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives  which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms or defending our position 
based on industry practice and prior experience  we believe that licenses or other rights  if necessary  will be available on commercially reasonable terms for existing or future claims 
nevertheless  we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained  or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur 
defending our intellectual property rights through litigation could be very costly 
if we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our reliance on sales to a few major customers and granting credit to those customers places us at financial risk 
as of september   receivables from two customers comprised of accounts receivable 
a concentration of our receivables from a small number of customers places us at risk 
if any one or more of our major customers is unable to pay us it could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 
amtech attempts to manage this credit risk by performing credit checks  requiring significant partial payments prior to shipment where appropriate  and actively monitoring collections 
our business might be adversely affected by our dependence on foreign business 
during the fiscal year ended september   of our sales were made to customers outside the united states as follows asia including singapore  indonesia  malaysia and india europe including israel and africa because of our significant dependence on international revenues  our operating results could be negatively affected by a continued or additional decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business 
each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period 
periodic local or international economic downturns  trade balance issues  political instability and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
we recorded a gain of 
million and a charge of 
million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as a result of foreign currency transactions 
while our business has not been materially affected in the past by foreign business or currency fluctuations  there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future 
such risk includes possible losses on account of currency exchange rate fluctuations  possible future prohibitions against repatriation of earnings  or proceeds from disposition of investments  and from possible social and military instability in the case of india  south korea  taiwan and possibly elsewhere 
our wholly owned subsidiary  tempress systems  has conducted its operations in the netherlands since fiscal as a result  such operations are subject to the taxation policies  employment and labor laws  transportation regulations  import and export regulations and tariffs  possible foreign exchange restrictions  international monetary fluctuations  and other political  economic and legal policies of that nation  the european economic union and the other european nations in which it conducts business 
consequently  we might encounter unforeseen or unfamiliar difficulties in conducting our european operations 
changes in such laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and costs 
the semiconductor equipment industry is competitive and we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources in comparison with our competitors 
our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide 
our future performance depends  in part  upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 
some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide 
we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products  some of which compete with the products and services that we offer 
these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products 
in addition  we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer  using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets 
loss of competitive position could impair our prices  customer orders  revenues  gross margins  and market share  any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business 
there is risk that larger  better financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those that we currently offer  or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease prices thereby putting us under financial pressure 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a negative impact on our revenues 
if we make additional acquisitions it could result in an increase in our costs of operations  divert management s attention away from other operational matters  and expose us to other risks associated with potential acquisitions 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions 
we might make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  other businesses with synergistic products  services and technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  lack of synergy  or inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  the risk that the issuance of amtech common stock in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to amtech stockholders if anticipated synergies are not realized  and acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance of the acquired company 
if our critical suppliers fail to deliver sufficient quantities of product in a timely and cost effective manner it could negatively affect our business 
we use a wide range of materials and services in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components  and we use numerous suppliers to supply materials 
we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
because of the variability and uniqueness of customers orders  we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing 
key suppliers include two steel mills capable of holding the type and tolerances that we require  an injection molder that provides plastic insets for steel carriers  an adhesive manufacturer that supplies the critical glue used in the production of the semiconductor polishing templates  and a pad supplier that produces a unique material used to attach semiconductor wafers to the polishing template 
we also rely on third parties for laser cutting  machined parts  steel frames and metal panels and other components used particularly in the assembly of semiconductor production equipment 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers  this is not always possible  accordingly  some key parts are being procured from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
the semiconductor industry s recent increase in demand for capital equipment has resulted in longer lead times for many important system components  which could cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers 
because the selling price of some systems exceeds million  the delay in the shipment of even a single system could cause significant variation in quarterly revenue  operating results and the market value of our stock 
we have sought  and will continue to seek  to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts  monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers  and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts 
there can be no assurance that results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if  in the future  we do not receive in a timely and cost effective manner a sufficient quantity of parts to meet our production requirements 
we might require additional financing to expand our operations 
on september   we issued  shares of common stock  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to  shares of common stock  in a private placement pursuant to a stock and warrant purchase agreement 
net proceeds to the company  after deducting placement agents  legal  accounting and registration fees  were approximately million 
the proceeds will be used to fund the company s growth initiatives 
while we believe that revenues generated from our operations  as well as the proceeds received from this private placement  are sufficient to provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future and for a limited number of growth initiatives  additional financing is expected to be required for further implementation of our plans for expansion 
there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available if and when required  or  even if available  that it would not materially dilute the ownership percentage of the then existing shareholders 
if our securities become ineligible for trading on the nasdaq system  they might be subject to rule g of the securities exchange act of  which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors 
while our common stock is now included on the nasdaq national market  continued inclusion will depend on our ability to meet certain eligibility requirements established for the nasdaq national market 
loss of nasdaq eligibility could result if we sustain material operating losses or if the market price of our common stock falls below per share 
for transactions covered by the rule  the broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale 
the rule may adversely affect the ability of broker dealers to sell our securities  and consequently may limit the public market for and the trading price of our common stock 
terrorist attacks and threats or actual war may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
recent terrorist attacks in the united states  as well as future events occurring in response or connection to them  including  without limitation  future terrorist attacks against united states targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies or military or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign suppliers of parts  components and subassemblies  may impact our operations  including  among other things  causing delays or losses in the delivery of supplies to us and decreased sales of our products 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs 
we are subject to environmental regulations and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations  including but not limited to regulations related to manufacturing and our customers use of our products 
from time to time  we receive notices regarding these regulations 
it is our policy to respond promptly to these notices and to take any necessary corrective action 
failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities  the imposition of fines and or the suspension or termination of development  manufacturing or use of certain of our products  each of which could damage our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amtech is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
its operations in the united states are conducted in united states dollars 
amtech s operation in the netherlands  a component of the semiconductor equipment segment  conducts business primarily in the euro and the united states dollar 
the functional currency of amtech s netherlands operation is euro 
amtech estimates that more than of its transactions are denominated in one of its two functional currencies or currencies that have fixed exchange rates with one of its functional currencies 
as of september   amtech did not hold any stand alone or separate derivative instruments 
amtech incurred a net foreign currency transaction gain of 
million in and loss of 
million in amtech s investment in and advances to its netherlands operation totals million 
a change in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar would cause a 
million foreign currency translation adjustment  a type of other comprehensive income loss  which would be a direct adjustment to stockholders equity 
when the value of the euro declines relative to the value of the united states dollar  operations in the netherlands can be more competitive against the united states based equipment suppliers and the cost of purchases denominated in united states dollars become more expensive 
when the value of the euro increases relative to the value of the united states dollar  operations in the netherlands must raise prices to those customers that normally make purchases in united states dollars  in order to maintain the same profit margins 
when this occurs  this operation attempts to have transactions denominated in the euro and to increase its purchases denominated in united states dollars 
amtech estimates that its fiscal purchases and sales of this foreign operation that are denominated in currencies not linked to its functional currency  including united states dollars  were approximately 
million and 
million  respectively 
amtech estimates that its fiscal purchases and sales of this foreign operation that are denominated in currencies not linked to its functional currency  including united states dollars  were approximately million and million  respectively 
most of those purchases are denominated in united states dollars and provide a partial hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates on sales denominated in that currency 
because it is difficult to predict the volume of dollar denominated transactions arising from the netherlands operations  amtech does not hedge against the effects of exchange rate changes on future transactions 
the euro is at a relatively high value relative to the united states dollar at the end of fiscal  giving amtech s operation based in the netherlands a competitive disadvantage over other suppliers based in the united states
