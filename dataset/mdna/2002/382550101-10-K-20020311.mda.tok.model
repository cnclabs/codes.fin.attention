strategic alliance on september   goodyear commenced operations under a global alliance with sumitomo rubber industries ltd 
sumitomo 
under the global alliance agreements  goodyear acquired  and sumitomo owned  of goodyear dunlop tires europe bv  a netherlands holding company 
concurrently  the holding company acquired substantially all of sumitomo s tire businesses in europe  including eight tire manufacturing plants located in england  france and germany and sales and distribution operations in european countries  and most of goodyear s tire businesses in europe 
excluded from the european joint venture are goodyear s tire businesses in poland other than a sales company  slovenia and turkey as well as morocco and south africa  goodyear s aircraft tire businesses  and goodyear s textile  steel tire cord and tire mold manufacturing plants  a technical center and related facilities located in luxembourg 
goodyear also acquired  and sumitomo acquired  of goodyear dunlop tires north america ltd  a holding company that purchased sumitomo s tire manufacturing operations in north america and certain of its related tire sales and distribution operations 
in addition  goodyear acquired of the balance of sumitomo s dunlop tire distribution and sales operations in the united states and canada 
goodyear also acquired a and sumitomo acquired a equity interest in each of two tire companies in japan  one for the distribution and sale of goodyear brand passenger and truck tires in the replacement market in japan and the other for the distribution and sale of goodyear brand and dunlop brand tires to original equipment manufacturers in japan 
goodyear transferred certain assets of its subsidiary located in japan in exchange for such equity interests and approximately million in cash 
goodyear also acquired a and sumitomo acquired a equity interest in a company that coordinates and disseminates commercialized tire technology among goodyear  sumitomo  the joint ventures and their respective affiliates  and an and sumitomo acquired a equity interest in a global purchasing company

the cost of the acquired businesses totaled approximately billion  including the cash payment of million and the fair value of of the goodyear businesses contributed to the european joint venture  or million 
in addition  the dunlop businesses contributed to the joint venture companies by sumitomo included million of debt 
approximately million of goodwill was recorded on the transaction which was being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
amortization was discontinued on january   as a result of goodyear s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodyear recognized a gain of million million after tax or 
per share on the change of control of of the businesses it contributed to the european joint venture

 rationalizations and no 
 investments 
the euro on january   the euro became the lawful currency of each member state of the european monetary union 
goodyear actively prepared for the conversion of all information systems software to the euro  which became the functional currency of most of its european businesses 
this conversion did not have a material impact on results of operations  financial position or liquidity of goodyear s operations 
uncertainties  accounting estimates and other matters if reduced levels of original equipment demand continue as anticipated  resulting lower levels of plant utilization would increase unit costs  which costs may not be recovered in the market 
increased labor costs are anticipated and goodyear could experience unexpected higher raw material and energy prices 
these costs  if incurred  may not be recoverable due to pricing pressures present in today s highly competitive market 
goodyear is unable to predict future currency fluctuations 
sales and earnings in future periods are likely to be unfavorably impacted if the us dollar strengthens versus various foreign currencies 
a continuation of the current economic downturn in the us and europe is likely to unfavorably impact goodyear s sales and earnings in future periods 
similarly  continued volatile economic conditions in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods 
the ultimate liability of goodyear in respect of the various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings to which it is a party cannot be estimated with certainty 
goodyear s accounting policy is to determine whether a liability should be recorded and to estimate the amount of such liability  based on the information available and using assumptions and methods it has concluded are appropriate 
as additional information becomes available  goodyear will reassess its evaluation of the pending claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
goodyear has established a liability in respect of the approximately  asbestos claims pending at december   and an asset for expected recoveries under insurance policies and coverage in place agreements with certain primary insurance carriers 
the claims relate to exposure to asbestos in certain rubber coated products manufactured by goodyear in the past or in certain goodyear facilities 
during  goodyear received approximately  new claims and resolved approximately  asbestos claims 
the amount spent on asbestos litigation defense and claim resolution during was approximately million before recovery of insurance proceeds 
goodyear believes it will recover a substantial portion of its liability from the proceeds of existing insurance policies 
goodyear cannot predict the number of future claims  the cost of disposing of existing and future claims  or the future ability to recover from insurance carriers 
goodyear also has claims asserted in other legal proceedings to which it is currently a party 
these proceedings include  among other things  several class actions relating to alleged breaches 
table of contents of warranty or product defects relating to goodyear entran ii hose used in certain home heating systems and certain of goodyear s load range d and e light truck tires 
a jury in a civil action between the company and heatway in federal district court in cleveland  ohio  found that the company did not breach the implied warranty of merchantability in respect of entran ii hose sold to heatway for installation in radiant heating systems and that the hose was fit for use in the systems and the court  on february   dismissed all claims of heatway regarding the entran ii hose 
on february   a jury in a civil action in a colorado state court awarded the plaintiffs damages for alleged defects in goodyear entran ii hose installed as part of heatway radiant heating systems at five homesites in the amount of million  which is trebled under the colorado consumer protection act  plus interest  attorney s fees and costs  for a total award of approximately million 
the company believes the verdict was based on material errors of fact and law and will appeal 
litigation is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict 
due to these inherent uncertainties  it is possible that the actual liability  if any  will differ from estimates 
based on its understanding and evaluation of these claims  as well as existing environmental claims  goodyear believes these matters are not likely to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position in future periods  although unanticipated adverse results in these proceedings could have a material impact on earnings and cash flow in any quarter or for any year 
the terms and conditions of goodyear s global alliance with sumitomo as set forth in the umbrella agreement between goodyear and sumitomo provide for certain minority exit rights available to sumitomo commencing in september sumitomo s exit rights  in the unlikely event of exercise  could require goodyear to make a substantial payment to acquire sumitomo s interest in the alliance 
goodyear entered into an agreement with pacific dunlop ltd 
pdl during relating to spt 
under the agreement  pdl has the right  during the period beginning august of and ending one year later  to require goodyear to purchase pdl s interest in spt at a formula price based on the earnings of spt 
if pdl does not exercise its right  goodyear may require pdl to sell its interest to goodyear during the days following the expiration of pdl s right at a price established using the same formula 
in view of current conditions in the financial markets  which are subject to change  and based on current estimates  it is possible that  beginning in  goodyear may be required to make substantial contributions to its domestic pension plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements in future periods 
recently issued accounting standards on january   goodyear adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted 
sfas requires all derivatives to be recognized as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
changes in such fair value will impact earnings to the extent of any ineffectiveness in hedging relationships 
the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of sfas increased shareholders equity by million 
on january   goodyear adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas requires that after a transfer of financial assets  an entity recognize the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  derecognize financial assets when control has been surrendered  and derecognize liabilities when extinguished 
a transfer of financial assets in which the transferor surrenders control over those assets is accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on goodyear s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 

table of contents on january   goodyear adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets and specifies that  among other things  intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill will no longer be amortized

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk goodyear actively manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix  within defined limitations  using refinancings and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
goodyear will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to hedge against the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce goodyear s risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates  and are normally designated as cash flow hedges 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates  and are normally designated as fair value hedges 
interest rate swap contracts are thus used by goodyear to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision 
at december   the interest rate on of goodyear s debt was fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate contracts  compared to at december  interest rate lock contracts are used to hedge the risk free rate component of anticipated long term debt issuances 
no interest rate lock contracts were outstanding at december  or 
table of contents the following tables present information at december in millions interest rate exchange contracts fair value unfavorable carrying amount long term asset current liability long term liability pro forma fair value unfavorable the pro forma information assumes a decrease in variable market interest rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption 
in millions fixed rate debt fair value carrying amount pro forma fair value the pro forma information assumes a basis point decrease in market interest rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption 
the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of goodyear s interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt was determined with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis 
the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve  and the precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows  goodyear was a party to various foreign currency forward exchange contracts at december  and these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment acquisitions  intercompany loans and goodyear s foreign currency denominated borrowings in the us the contract maturities match the maturities of the currency positions 
changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged positions
