many of the conditions impacting these assumptions and estimates are outside of the company s control 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa in october and as amended by sop issued in december the company records product revenue from software licenses and products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been shipped  there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable 
the company uses the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element 
the company s multiple element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post contract customer support pcs are sold together 
the company has established vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered pcs element based on the contracted price for renewal pcs included in the original multiple element sales arrangement  as substantiated by contractual terms and the company s significant pcs renewal experience  from its large installed base of over million users worldwide 
the company s multiple element sales arrangements generally include rights for the customer to renew pcs after the bundled term ends 
these rights are irrevocable to the customer s benefit  are for specified prices and the customer is not subject to any economic or other penalty for failure to renew 
further  the renewal pcs options are for services comparable to the bundled pcs and cover similar terms 
it is the company s experience that customers generally exercise their renewal pcs option 
in the renewal transaction  pcs is sold on a stand alone basis to the licensees one year or more after the original multiple element sales arrangement 
the renewal pcs price is consistent with the renewal price in the original multiple element sales arrangement although an adjustment to reflect consumer price changes are not uncommon 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
service revenues consist of revenues from consulting contracts as well as training and integration services contracts 
contract revenues are derived from contracts to develop applications and to provide consulting services 
contract revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method  using a methodology that accounts for costs incurred under the contract in relation to the total estimated costs under the contract  after providing for any anticipated losses under the contract 
revenues from training and integration services are recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
customer support revenues consist of revenue derived from contracts to provide technical support to license holders 
these revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
network revenues consist of revenues earned from customers under an application service provider asp model 
under this model  customers pay a monthly fee that entitles them to use of the company s software on a secure  hosted  third party server 
these revenues are recognized as the services are provided on a monthly basis over the term of the customer s contract 
with respect to these revenues  the company s customers pay exclusively for the right to use the software 
the company s customers do not receive the right to take possession of the company s software 
further  it is not possible for customers to either run the software on their own hardware or for them to contract with another party unrelated to the company to host the software 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customer s financial condition and if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would likely be required 
actual collections could differ materially from our estimates 
investments 
from time to time the company may hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of companies in whom the company has invested could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
valuation allowance 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered to be more likely than not to be realized 
at june   no net deferred tax asset has been recognized 
the company considers estimated future taxable income by taxing jurisdictions and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for and size of the valuation allowance 
if the company were to conclude that it was able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in an amount that differs from its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be required with the change generally recognized in the determination of income for the period 
long lived assets 
the company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company evaluates the carrying value of intangible assets for impairment of value based on undiscounted future cash flows 
while the company has not experienced the impairment of intangible assets in prior periods  the company cannot guarantee that there will not be impairment in the future 
litigation 
the company is a party  from time to time  in legal proceedings 
for such cases  the company assesses the likelihood that a loss will result  as well as the amount of such loss and the financial statements provide for the company s best estimate of such losses 
to the extent that any of these legal proceedings are resolved and result in the company being required to pay an amount in excess of what has been provided for in the financial statements  the company would be required to record  against earnings  such excess amount at that time 
if the resolution resulted in a gain to the company  or a loss less than that provided for  such gain is recognized when received or receivable

total revenues increased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  revenues from licenses and networking decreased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  the decrease in license and networking revenues was a result of the overall slowdown in information technology spending which was  in part  accelerated by the september th terrorist activities which then continued throughout fiscal though all aspects of the company s revenues were affected by this overall economic slowdown  revenues relating to the company s licenses were most strongly impacted 
it was the company s experience throughout most of fiscal that customers were more hesitant to commit to large  enterprise wide deployments of the company s software and as a result  the company has experienced a lengthening of its sales cycles 
some potentially larger deals were replaced by smaller deals  while other large deals were simply deferred by customers 
several of these large deals were ultimately completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  when certain customer opportunities that had been worked on throughout the year finally closed 
at this point  the company is uncertain as to whether the increased license activity experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal is indicative of license revenue activity that will continue into fiscal also during fiscal  the company began actively promoting the rental of livelink to customers through an application service provider asp model 
under this model  users are granted use of livelink on a secure  hosted third party server  for which they pay a monthly fee on a per user basis 
revenues earned from this service have been classified as networking revenues 
during fiscal networking revenues totaled million  as compared with million in fiscal customer support revenues increased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  the increase in customer support revenues resulted from several factors 
the licenses granted throughout fiscal  as well as strong renewal rates for maintenance contracts for existing accounts  had a positive impact on customer support revenues 
also  in fiscal  the company completed a number of acquisitions during the middle of the year 
as a result  fiscal s customer support revenue includes only a partial year of revenues from these acquisitions  while fiscal contains a full year s customer support revenues for the acquired businesses

service revenues increased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  the increase in service revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting and integration services provided to new license customers

this was a result of the company entering into fewer subcontracting arrangements during fiscal  as well as using fewer consultants

the company may need to raise additional funds  however  in order to fund more rapid expansion of its business  develop new and enhance existing products and services  or acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of the company s shareholders may be reduced  the company s shareholders may experience additional dilution  and such securities may have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of it s the company s current shareholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  the company s ability to fund its expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or develop or enhance the company s services or products would be significantly limited 
cautionary statements certain statements in this annual report on form k constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  including those set forth in the following cautionary statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company  or developments in the company s industry  to differ materially from the anticipated results  performance  achievements or developments expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the following factors  as well as all of the other information set forth herein  should be considered carefully in evaluating open text and its business 
if any of the following risks were to occur  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer 
in that event  the trading price of the company s common shares would likely decline 
if the company does not continue to develop new technologically advanced products  future revenues will be negatively affected open text s success will depend on its ability to design  develop  test  market  license and support new software products and enhancements of current products on a timely basis in response to both competitive products and evolving demands of the marketplace 
in addition  new software products and enhancements must remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats 
presently  open text is continuing to enhance the capability of its livelink to enable users to form workgroups and collaborate on intranets and the internet 
the company increasingly must integrate software licensed from third parties with its own software to create or improve intranet and internet products 
these products are key to the success of the company s strategy  and the company may not be successful in developing and marketing these and other new software products and enhancements 
if the company is unable to successfully integrate the technologies licensed from third parties  to develop new software products and enhancements to existing products  or to complete products currently under development  or if such integrated or new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  the company s operating results will materially suffer 
in addition  if new industry standards emerge that the company does not anticipate or adapt to  the company s software products could be rendered obsolete and its business would be materially harmed 
if the company s products and services do not gain market acceptance  the company may not be able to increase its revenues open text is continually working on the development of  and improvements to  new versions of livelink and other products 
in november  the company released livelink meetingzone tm  and in april  the company released livelink wireless tm 
in february  open text released livelink  the latest release of the company s flagship product 
the primary market for open text s software and services is rapidly evolving 
as is typical in the case of a new and rapidly evolving industry  demand for and market acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
if the markets for the company s products and services fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become saturated with competitors  the company s business will suffer 
the company may be unable to successfully market its current products and services  develop new software products  services and enhancements to current products and services  complete customer installations on a timely basis  or complete products and services currently under development 
if the company s products and services or enhancements do not achieve and sustain market acceptance  the company s business and operating results will be materially harmed 
the company s products may contain defects that could harm the company s reputation  be costly to correct  delay revenues  and expose the company to litigation the company s products are highly complex and sophisticated and  from time to time  may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors may be found in new software products or improvements to existing products after commencement of commercial shipments  or  if discovered  the company may not be able to successfully correct such errors in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  despite tests carried out by the company on all its products  the company may not be able to fully simulate the environment in which its products will operate and  as a result  the company may be unable to adequately detect design defects or software errors inherent in its products and which only become apparent when the products are installed in an end user s network 
the occurrence of errors and failures in the company s products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of the company s products  and alleviating such errors and failures in the company s products could require significant expenditure of capital and other resources by the company 
because the company s end user base consists of a limited number of end users  the harm to the company s reputation resulting from product errors and failures would be damaging to the company 
the company regularly provides a warranty with its products and the financial impact of these warranty obligations may be significant in the future 
the company s agreements with its strategic partners and end users typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to claims  such as exclusions of all implied warranties and limitations on damage remedies and the availability of consequential or incidental damages 
however  such provisions may not effectively protect the company against claims and related liabilities and costs 
although the company maintains errors and omissions insurance coverage and comprehensive liability insurance coverage  such coverage may not be adequate and all claims may not be covered 
accordingly  any such claim could negatively affect the company s financial condition 
the company currently depends on certain third party software  the loss of which could result in increased costs of  or delays in  licenses of the company s products the company relies on certain software that it licenses from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and which is used in its products to perform key functions 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  and the related software may not continue to be appropriately supported  maintained  or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss of license to use  or the inability of licensors to support  maintain  and enhance any of such software  could result in increased costs  delays  or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software is developed or licensed  if at all  and integrated 
current and future competitors could have a significant impact on the company s ability to generate future revenue and profits the markets for the company s products are new  intensely competitive  subject to rapid technological change and are evolving rapidly 
the company expects competition to increase and intensify in the future as the markets for the company s products continue to develop and as additional companies enter each of its markets 
numerous releases of products and services that compete with those of the company can be expected in the near future 
the company may not be able to compete effectively with current and future competitors 
if competitors were to engage in aggressive pricing policies with respect to competing products  or significant price competition were to otherwise develop  the company would likely be forced to lower its prices 
this could result in lower revenues  reduced margins  loss of customers  or loss of market share for the company 
the length of the company s sales cycle can fluctuate significantly which could result in significant fluctuations in license revenue being recognized from quarter to quarter because the decision by a customer to purchase the company s products often involves relatively large scale implementation across the customer s network or networks  licenses of these products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers  accompanied by the attendant risks and delays frequently associated with significant expenditures and lengthy sales cycle and implementation procedures 
given the significant investment and commitment of resources required by an organization in order to implement the company s software  the company s sales cycle tends to take considerable time to complete 
particularly in the current economic environment of reduced information technology spending  it can take several months  or even quarters  for sales opportunities to translate into revenue 
if installation of the company s products in one or more customers takes longer than originally anticipated  the date on which revenue from these licenses could be recognized would be delayed 
such delays could cause the company s revenues to be lower than expected in a particular period 
the company may not achieve its anticipated revenues if it does not expand its product line substantially all of open text s revenues are currently derived from its livelink and related products and services offered by the company in the internet  intranet and extranet markets 
accordingly  the company s future results of operations will depend  in part  on expanding its product line and related services 
to achieve its revenue goals  the company must also continue to enhance these products and services to meet the evolving needs of its customers 
a reduction in demand or increase in competition in the market for internet or intranet applications  or a decline in licenses of livelink and related services  would significantly harm the company s business 
the company must continue to manage its growth or its operating results could be adversely affected over the past several years  open text has experienced growth in revenues  operating expenses  and product distribution channels 
in addition  open text s markets have continued to evolve at a rapid pace 
the total number of employees of the company has grown from as of september  to  excluding contractors  as of june  the company believes that continued growth in the breadth of its product lines and services and in the number of personnel will be required in order to establish and maintain the company s competitive position 
moreover  the company has grown significantly through acquisitions in the past and continues to review acquisition opportunities as a means of increasing the size and scope of its business 
open text s growth  coupled with the rapid evolution of the company s markets  has placed  and is likely to continue to place  significant strains on its administrative and operational resources and increased demands on its internal systems  procedures and controls 
the company s administrative infrastructure  systems  procedures and controls may not adequately support the company s operations and the company s management may not be able to achieve the rapid  effective execution of the product and business initiatives necessary to successfully penetrate the markets for the company s products and services and to successfully integrate any business acquisitions in the future 
if the company is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s operating results will likely suffer 
future acquisitions  investments  joint ventures and other business initiatives may negatively affect our operating results open text continues to seek out opportunities to acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies that expand  complement or are otherwise related to the company s current business or products 
the company also considers from time to time  opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments 
these activities create risks such as the need to integrate and manage the business acquired with the business of the company  additional demands on the company s management  resources  systems  procedures and controls  disruption of the company s ongoing business  and diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
moreover  these transactions could involve substantial investment of funds and or technology transfers  the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses 
also  such activities could result in one times charges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute existing shareholders or result in the assumption of debt 
such acquisitions  investments  joint ventures or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and other resources of the company 
any such activity may not be successful in generating revenue  income or other returns to the company  and the financial or other resources committed to such activities will not be available to the company for other purposes 
the company s inability to address these risks could negatively affect the company s operating results 
the company s products rely on the stability of various infrastructure software which  if not stable  could negatively impact the effectiveness of the company s products  resulting in harm to the reputation and business of the company developments of internet and intranet applications by open text depends on the stability  functionality and scalability of the infrastructure software of the underlying intranet  such as that of netscape  microsoft and others 
if weaknesses in such infrastructure software exist  the company may not be able to correct or compensate for such weaknesses 
if the company is unable to address weaknesses resulting from problems in the infrastructure software such that the company s products do not meet customer needs or expectations  the company s business and reputation may be significantly harmed 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate which could impact the price of the company s common shares the company has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results caused by many factors  including changes in the demand for the company s products  the introduction or enhancement of products by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of enhancements or products  delays in the introduction of products or enhancements by the company or its competitors  customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products  changes in the company s pricing policies or those of its competitors  delays involved in installing products with customers  the mix of distribution channels through which products are licensed  the mix of products and services sold  the mix of international and north american revenues  foreign currency exchange rates and general economic conditions 
like many other software companies  the company has generally recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last weeks of each quarter 
accordingly  the cancellation or deferrals of even a small number of licenses or delays in installations of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in any particular quarter 
the company also has noted historically lower sales in july and august than in other months  which has resulted in proportionately lower revenues recorded in the quarter ended september than in other quarters 
because of the impact of the timing of product introductions and the rapid evolution of the company s business and the markets it serves  the company cannot predict whether seasonal patterns experienced in the past will continue 
for these reasons  no one should rely on period to period comparisons of the company s financial results to forecast future performance 
it is likely that the company s quarterly revenue and operating results will vary significantly in the future and if a shortfall in revenue occurs or if operating costs increase significantly  the market price of our common shares could decline 
failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete effectively the company is highly dependent on its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights may not be successful 
the company relies on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain its proprietary rights 
the company has not sought patent protection for its products 
while us and canadian copyright laws  international conventions and international treaties may provide meaningful protection against unauthorized duplication of software  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of canada or the united states 
software piracy has been  and can be expected to be  a persistent problem for the software industry 
enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights may be difficult  particularly in some nations outside of the united states and canada in which the company seeks to market its products 
despite the precautions taken by the company  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties  including competitors  to copy certain portions of the company s products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
although the company does not believe that its products infringe on the rights of third parties  third parties may assert infringement claims against the company in the future  and any such assertions may result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third parties  such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
if the company is not able to attract and retain top employees  the company s ability to compete may be harmed the company s performance is substantially dependent on the performance of its executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could significantly harm the company s business 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of its employees 
the company s success is also highly dependent on its continuing ability to identify  hire  train  retain and motivate highly qualified management  technical  sales and marketing personnel  including recently hired officers and other employees 
specifically  the recruitment of top research developers  along with experienced salespeople  remains critical to the company s success 
competition for such personnel is intense  and the company may not be able to attract  integrate or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
the volatility of the company s stock price could lead to losses by shareholders the market price of the common shares has been highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
such fluctuations in market price may continue in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or other events or factors 
in addition  the financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies or have resulted from the failure of the operating results of such companies to meet market expectations in a particular quarter 
broad market fluctuations or any failure of the company s operating results in a particular quarter to meet market expectations may adversely affect the market price of the common shares  resulting in losses to shareholders 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company 
due to the volatility of our stock price  the company could be the target of securities litigation in the future 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
a reduction in the number or sales efforts by distributors could materially impact the company s revenues a portion of the company s revenue is derived from the license of its products through third parties 
the company s success will depend  in part  upon its ability to maintain access to existing channels of distribution and to gain access to new channels if and when they develop 
the company may not be able to retain a sufficient number of its existing or future distributors 
distributors may also give higher priority to the sale of other products which could include products of competitors or may not devote sufficient resources to marketing the company s products 
the performance of third party distributors is largely outside the control of the company and the company is unable to predict the extent to which these distributors will be successful in marketing and licensing the company s products 
a reduction in sales efforts  or a decline in the number of distributors  or the discontinuance of sales of the company s products by its distributors could lead to reduced revenue 
the company s international operations expose the company to business risks that could cause the company s operating results to suffer open text intends to continue to make efforts to increase its international operations and anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenue 
revenues derived outside of north america represented   and of total revenues for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
these international operations are subject to certain risks and costs  including the difficulty and expense of administering business abroad  compliance with foreign laws  compliance with domestic and international import and export laws and regulations  costs related to localizing products for foreign markets  and costs related to translating and distributing products in a timely manner 
international operations also tend to expose the company to a longer sales and collection cycle  as well as potential losses arising from currency fluctuations  and limitations regarding the repatriation of earnings 
significant international sales may also expose the company to greater risk from political and economic instability  unexpected changes in canadian  us or other governmental policies concerning import and export of goods and technology  and other regulatory requirements and tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  international earnings may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  which could also materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
moreover  international expansion may be more difficult  time consuming  and costly 
as a result  if revenues from international operations do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining foreign operations  the company s operating results will suffer 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risks the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to its investment portfolio  since the company had no borrowings outstanding under its line of credit at june  the company primarily invests its cash in short term high quality securities with reputable financial institutions
