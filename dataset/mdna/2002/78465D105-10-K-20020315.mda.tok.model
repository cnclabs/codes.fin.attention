results of continuing operations the following table sets forth certain historical operating results as a percentage of revenue years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating income income from continuing operations 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the foregoing table and the fiscal year comparison that follows do not include the discontinued operations of emergent central and emergent east 
comparison of fiscal years ended december   and revenue 
we derive our revenue from the various consulting services that we provide proposal management  program support services  management consulting  and competitive strategy services 
revenue increased million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily the result of an increase in program support services 
this increase was offset by a decrease in proposal management revenue related to a lower number of major procurements attributable to the new administration s defense budget being approved later than expected 
revenue for decreased million  or compared to million for the decrease resulted primarily from lower procurement levels in gross margin 
gross margin increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  gross margin decreased to compared to for the increase in gross margin dollars is a result of increased revenue from program support services 
however  such services carry lower margins than our other services resulting in a decrease in the gross margin percentage 
gross margin increased million  or  to million  for as compared to million for as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased to compared to for the prior year period 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was attributed to the size  mix and pricing of contracts in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional services and other general corporate activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for year ended december   as compared to for the prior year period 
the decrease is the result of reductions in executive personnel and general corporate overhead resulting from cost control initiatives implemented in december selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in  as compared to million for as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for  as compared to for this increase was the result of increases in executive personnel  consultants and a buildup in administrative staff  as compared to operating income 
operating income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
as a percentage of revenue  operating income increased to for the year ended december  from in the prior year 
operating income increased due to the increased revenue and the decreased selling  general and administrative expenses  as discussed above 
operating income was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million 
as a percentage of revenue  operating income decreased to for from for the prior year period  which is attributed to an increase in general and administrative costs during interest expense  net 
interest expense  net was million for the year ended december  compared to million  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fluctuations primarily result from the related levels of debt for the respective years  the amortization of debt discount  and interest expense on our interest rate swap 
unrealized loss on interest rate swap 
during  we recognized a loss of million resulting from changes in the fair value of its interest rate swap agreement 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended  which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  january  for us 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met 
accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gain and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that an entity must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we adopted sfas on january  we have one interest rate swap agreement that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge 
accordingly  during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a net of tax  cumulative effect adjustment of million to recognize the interest swap at fair value at january  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased to million in from million in income from continuing operations was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
this increase in and decrease in from are due primarily to the increased cost resulting from acquisitions in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities of million reflected our income from continuing operations of million  increased by charges for depreciation  amortization and other non cash items and a decrease in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million which primarily related to an increase in restricted cash 
we have pledged a portion of our cash as collateral for stand by letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations 
these amounts are shown as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets 
net cash used in financing activities 
for the year ended december   net cash of million was used by financing activities primarily for repayments made under our credit facility  net of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan and from exercise of stock options 
on november   we completed the sale of emergent east 
we used the proceeds from the sale to pay off our revolving credit facility in november at december   our outstanding debt for subordinated notes was million 
on january   all amounts outstanding were repaid 
concurrent with the repayment of our long term debt  we entered into a line of credit agreement with a bank for working capital purposes 
the line of credit provides for maximum borrowings of million  based on eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the agreement  and includes both a revolving loan and letter of credit feature 
our obligations under the line of credit are secured by substantially all of our assets 
interest on the line of credit fluctuates with the prime rate and could increase to the prime rate plus in certain circumstances 
the agreement contains financial covenants pertaining to our tangible net worth 
at march   our outstanding borrowings under the line of credit were million  the bank had issued letters of credit for million and we had million in remaining availability 
we believe that we will have sufficient working capital from our current cash  availability under the line of credit and cash generated by continuing operations to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
the company s contractual obligations are as follows at december  contractual obligations payments due by period year after total or less years years years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases operating leases related to discontinued operations interest rate swap total our long term debt is represented by a million senior subordinated note that is due in and bears interest at 
on january   we paid the note in full  and as a result of the early extinguishment incurred a prepayment penalty of million 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating leases related to discontinued operations represents office space previously occupied by the emergent east and emergent central divisions 
the amounts above represent the remaining lease commitments over the term of the lease 
we are in the process of identifying sub lessees for such property or negotiating lease buy outs with the lessors 
under the terms of our interest rate swap agreement  we must pay on million  and in return receive a variable interest rate based on one month libor 
the above amounts represent only our contractual payments under the agreement 
in addition to our contractual obligations  we maintain certain commercial commitments 
we have deposited million with a financial institution as collateral for letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations  primarily the interest rate swap agreement and certain property leases 
the expiration dates of those commitments are as follows other commercial amount of commitment expiration per period commitments total amounts less than in thousands committed year years years over years standby letters of credit critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our services are provided under time and expenses billing arrangements  and revenue is recognized on the basis of hours utilized  plus other reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period 
revenue is directly related to the total number of hours billed to clients and the associated hourly billing rates 
a limited amount of revenue is also derived from success fees offered to clients as a pricing option  and recorded as revenue only upon the attainment of the specified incentive criteria 
success fees are not billable until a contract is won by the client 
we must make estimates of potential future uncollectible accounts receivable related to current period revenue 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december   because we believe it is more likely than not that we can recover such assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the principal market risk ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
on may   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we pay a fixed rate of interest of on million  and receive a variable rate of interest based on one month libor 
we estimate that a decrease in libor would decrease our reported net income by approximately  annually 
this interest rate sensitivity analyses disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category and vice versa
