this increase was entirely the result of higher sales of coins of approximately  the increase in coin revenue was partially offset by a decrease in commission revenue of approximately  a decrease of  due to the sale of the comic and movie poster division in september and a decrease of  due to a softening of the sports market 
the variation in any year in the composition of total revenues as between revenues resulting from inventory sales and commissions resulting from consignment sales is largely a function of availability  market demand and conditions rather than any deliberate attempt by the company to emphasize one area over the other 
sellers consignors of property to the company generally make their own determinations as to whether the property should be sold to the company for the specified price offered by the company or offered for sale at auction at a price that cannot be predicted in advance 
such determination is based on the potential risks and rewards involved  and includes an evaluation of the marketability of the property and the potential pool of buyers 
the company engages in a similar analysis in determining whether to acquire inventory for its own account and the price it is willing to pay for such inventory 
gross profit increased from approximately  for the year ended june  to approximately  for the year ended june  this represents an increase of approximately  
included in cost of merchandise sold are reserves recorded to reflect management s estimate of net realizable value of inventories relating to price variability of approximately   and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increased gross profit also reflects a stronger inventory value resulting from management s aggressive program to lower inventory balances of poorly performing inventory  which was initiated in fiscal operating expenses the increase in overall costs  in combination with the revenue increases had the effect of decreasing operating costs as a percentage of operating revenue from during the year ended june  to in the year ended june  the company recorded expenses relating to bad debt of in fiscal and during fiscal over the past five the average ratio of bad debt to aggregate sales was less than

interest income and expense interest expense decreased approximately to approximately for the year ended june  as compared to that of the previous year 
this decrease was attributable to lower average borrowings caused primarily by the repayment of loans as well as a reduction of the loan guarantee fee paid to greg manning from in fiscal to in fiscal interest income decreased during the year ended june  by approximately 
this was caused by an overall decrease in advances to consignors 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate benefit for the year ended june  and were approximately and  respectively

included in the operating loss for fiscal are expenses relating to intangible impairment of  and acquisition and merger costs of the primary changes in the operating expenses for the year ended june  from the prior year were decreases in marketing costs of approximately and general and administrative expenses of approximately  which were partly offset by increases in depreciation and amortization of approximately and salaries and wages of approximately

the difference primarily relates to a valuation allowance provided for net operating loss carryforwards 
this rate may change in future periods if operating results or acquisition related costs differ significantly from current projections 
net income loss the company recorded a net loss for the year ended june  of approximately  compared to approximately  for the year ended june  and reflected an increased loss of approximately  during this period 
the decrease in operating income of approximately  during the year ended june   coupled with the increase in losses from operations of investees of approximately  and a decrease in the provision for income taxes benefit of approximately compared to the previous year were the main contributors to the change in earnings 
of the aforementioned loss from operations of investees  approximately  relates directly to advances made by gmai asia  to its unconsolidated affiliates  china everbright telecommunication products  ltd 
products and iatoz 
com  limited iatoz 
these advances were written off in fiscal  the effect of this write off on gmai s fiscal results was approximately  the effect on the company relating to gmai asia s amortization of goodwill expense was approximately  european monetary union the european monetary unit the euro was introduced on january  as a wholesale currency 
the eleven participating european monetary union member countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the euro 
the existing currencies will continue to be used as legal tender through january   thereafter  on july   the existing currencies will be cancelled and euro bills and coins will be used for cash transactions in the participating countries 
the company believes that its european financial and cash management operations affected by the euro conversion have adequately been prepared for its introduction 
the company is able to determine the ultimate financial impact  if any  of the euro conversion on its operations  given that the impact will be dependent upon the competitive situations that exist in the various regional markets in which the company participates 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities the company experienced a negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately for the year ended june  as compared to a positive cash flow of approximately for fiscal  a decrease of approximately  this decrease in cash flow for the year ended june  was primarily attributable to a decline in the net change in inventory of approximately  as compared to a decrease of  in year ended june  the company experienced a positive cash flow from operating activities of approximately for the year ended june  as compared to a negative cash flow of approximately  for fiscal  an increase of approximately  this increase in cash flow for the year ended june  was primarily attributable to a decrease in inventory of approximately  and a decrease in advances it s consignors of approximately  and a decrease in accounts payable to third party consignors of approximately  contractual obligations our contractual obligations related to non cancelable operating and capital leases at june  were as follows payments due in operating leases capital leases year years years years years more than years commercial commitments our commercial commitments at june  consist of a remaining guarantee of  of indebtedness of china everbright telecom land s shanghai subsidiary 
the guarantee was entered into as part of the february  acquisition of gmai asia see note to accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this commitment is expected to expire in fiscal investing activities the company had a negative cash flow from investing activities of approximately for year ended june  as compared to a negative cash flow of for year ended june  or an increase of the increase in cash flow in was attributable to a decline in capital expenditures in the amount of approximately the company had a negative cash flow from investing activities of approximately for the year ended june  as compared to a negative cash flow of approximately  for the previous year  an increase of approximately  the change in cash flows for the year ended june  was primarily attributable to a decrease in equity method investees 
financing activities the company had positive cash flow from financing activities of approximately in year ended june  or a decrease of from fiscal year ended part of the decrease in fiscal was due to a total reduction in debt of  and a decrease of in proceeds from the sale of common stock 
in there were no purchases of treasury stock in as opposed to a purchase of  of treasury stock in the company had positive cash flow from financing activities of approximately  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the previous year  a decrease of approximately  this decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in proceeds from stock subscriptions receivable of approximately  and proceeds from the sale of common stock of approximately  which was partly offset by decreases in repayment of demand and loans payable of approximately  during october  the company paid off its previous line of credit facilities with brown brothers harriman co 
and bank of america 
this debt was replaced with the following credit facilities during the company entered into an agreement with afinsa to which afinsa agreed to provide the company with a revolving credit facility of up to  borrowings under this facility bear interest at an annual rate of 
the agreement also provides that any borrowings not repaid in accordance with the terms of the agreement may be converted into gmai stock at the discretion of afinsa 
as of june    and as of september    had been borrowed under this agreement 
the agreement expires october and is expected to be renewed for an additional months 
the company also has a note with a privately held capital fund in the amount of  at june  the loan is collateralized by inventory and has an interest rate of and is due december  the company has a note payable in the amount of  collateralized by specific coin inventory with an interest rate of with quarterly payments of commencing in april until the loan is repaid in june the balance of notes payable of represents capital leases for the purchase of equipment and they carry interest rates ranging from to 
during june  the company entered into a letter of intent with afinsa  relating to the sale of substantially all of afinsa s non investment collectibles business  currently operated primarily through auctentia  in exchange for shares of gmai s common stock 
auctentia currently owns approximately of the common stock of gmai 
if the transaction is completed  the company expects that auctentia or an affiliate will own approximately of its common stock 
it is currently anticipated that the businesses to be sold to gmai will include businesses focused on philatelic and numismatic collecting  including  among others  afinsa auctions  heinrich kohler and de rosa group international  businesses focused on the fine arts market  including  among others  art galleries and finarte espana auction  as well as the online operations of centrodearte  doocollect and mercart 
if the deal is consummated  the company believes that the combined company will be one of the world s largest collectibles companies 
the impact of this transaction on financial condition  results of operations  and earnings per share is not known at this time 
the letter of intent  which is non binding  provides for the parties immediately to start negotiating a definitive purchase agreement and complete the due diligence process 
this process is ongoing 
it is expected that the transaction will close by the quarter ended march  the purchase agreement will contain usual and customary conditions to closing  including obtaining shareholder approval of the transaction and any required regulatory approvals 
there can be no assurance that the proposed transaction will be consummated  or if consummated  on the terms described above 
a buyer of auctioned property may be permitted to take possession of the property before payment is made 
most accounts receivable are collected within to days  which is consistent with business practice in the collectible markets 
for the years ended june  and  the company s expense relating to bad debt was approximately and respectively 
for the years ended june  and the company s history of bad debts has been less than of revenue 
because of the nature of the auction business of the company  there is a relationship between accounts receivable  advances to consignors  and payable to consignors 
depending upon the relationship of the balance sheet date to a given auction sale date and a settlement date for a given auction  these balances could change substantially from one balance sheet date to another 
in the cycle of any single auction  the effect on the balance sheet and on the company s cash flows is significant when compared to the total assets of the company 
the cycle for a single auction begins with consignors contracting with the company to sell their property at auction 
typically these contracts are signed from to weeks in advance of the auction sale date 
no entry is made on the balance sheet of the company when the company receives the property for auction or when a contract for the consignment to the auction is signed 
since the contract for the sale of the property is for services not yet rendered  there is no financial statement impact 
at the time of the consignment  or any time thereafter until the auction sale date  the consignor may request a cash advance which is a prepaid portion of the prices to be realized of the property irrevocably committed to be sold in the auction 
the cash advance takes the form of a self liquidating  secured loan to the consignor  using the property consigned as collateral 
cash advances to consignors are often used as a marketing tool in order to obtain property for a sale 
when the cash advance is made  there is an increase of the accounts of the company in cash advances to consignors  and simultaneously  there is a corresponding decrease in cash 
approximately weeks after the auction date  often referred to as the settlement date  the payables to consignors decrease to zero as all the consignors are paid and the company withholds a portion of the amounts due the consignor for the sale of the property as an offset to repay the principal amount and the accrued interest on  the cash advances to consignors or loans to consignors  and there is a decrease in cash  corresponding to the net amount paid to the consignors 
the entire cycle for a single auction typically is about to weeks in duration 
because of the high level of activity in the company  single auction cycles do not occur in series  with the next cycle beginning immediately after the previous cycle ends 
rather  single auction cycles occur in parallel 
for example  when a certain cycle ends  a second cycle may be at the midpoint  while yet a third cycle is just beginning 
depending upon the relative values of the property consigned to each sale in the three cycles in this example  and depending upon the demand for auction advances in each of the cycles  the cumulative effect on the balance sheet  and particularly the current assets and current liabilities and the company s cash flows  is very significant 
the company has developed both a customer and supplier base of major stamp  numismatic  sports and other collectibles dealers and collectors throughout the world that services the company s operations 
although intense competition exists for the acquisition of quality properties for purchase or consignment from estates and private collectors  the company believes that the short term and long term availability of these items will continue to be sufficient to augment the core dealer based business 
while there can be no assurance that prices of and demand for the collectibles offered by the company will not decrease in the future  demand has traditionally not been adversely affected by negative economic conditions 
however  the company s need for liquidity and working capital may increase as a result of its potential business expansion activities 
in addition to the need for such capital to enhance the company s ability to offer cash advances to a larger number of potential consignors of property which is an important aspect of the marketing of an auction business  the company will require additional working capital in the future in order to further expand its sports trading card and sports memorabilia auction business  to acquire collectibles for sale in the company s business  to expand into sales of other collectibles and to initiate any other new business activities 
management believes that the company s cash flow from ongoing operations supplemented by the company s working capital credit facilities will be adequate to fund the company s working capital requirements for the next months 
however  to complete any of the company s proposed expansion activities or to make any significant acquisitions  the company will consider exploring financing alternatives including increasing its working capital credit facilities or raising additional debt or equity capital 
the raising of additional equity capital will cause dilution to existing shareholders 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company has not been significant during the last three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which the company relies are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following o revenue recognition o allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns o inventory valuation and classification o goodwill and intangible assets o accounting for income taxes in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed the company s critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues from two primary sources auction revenue revenue is recognized when collectibles are sold at auction and is represented by an auction commission received from the buyer and seller 
auction commissions represent a percentage of the hammer price at auction sales as paid by the buyer and the seller 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a net basis as commission revenue 
the company also sells its own inventory at auction 
revenue of owned inventory is recognized when sold at auction 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a gross basis as sales of merchandise 
additionally  the company is entitled to auction commissions paid by the buyer 
sales returns have not been material 
private treaty sales private treaty sales represent sales of consigned property and sales of owned inventory 
private treaty sales of consigned property occur when an owner of property arranges with the company to sell such consigned property to a third party at a privately negotiated price 
in such a transaction  the owner may set selling price parameters for the company  or the company may solicit selling prices for the owner  and the owner may reserve the right to reject any selling price 
the company does not guarantee a fixed price to the owner  which would be payable regardless of the actual sales price ultimately received 
the company recognizes as private treaty revenue an amount equal to a percentage of the sales price 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a net basis as commission revenue and are recognized when sold 
private treaty sales of owned inventory occur when the company sells its goods directly to a customer either wholesale or retail 
revenue with respect to private treaty revenues is recognized when delivered or released to the customer for acceptance or to a common carrier for delivery 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a gross basis as sales of merchandise 
sales returns have not been material 
the company does not provide any guarantee with respect to the authenticity of property offered for sale at auction 
each lot is sold as genuine and as described by the company in the catalogue 
when however  in the opinion of a competent authority mutually acceptable to the company and the purchaser  a lot is declared otherwise  the purchase price will be refunded in full if the lot is returned to the company within a specified period 
in such event  the company will return such lot to the consignor before a settlement payment has been made to such consignor for the lot in question 
to date  returns have not been material 
large collections are generally sold on an as is basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company makes judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding auction and consignor advances receivables and provides allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
the company continuously monitors payments from it s customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when the company evaluates the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts  it takes into account various factors including accounts receivable aging  customer credit worthiness  historical bad debts  and geographic and political risk 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company also records a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based used on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data the company used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
sales returns have not historically been material 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventory valuation and classification inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm  which reflects management s estimates of net realizable value 
inventories are accounted for under the specific identification method 
in instances where bulk purchases are made  the cost allocation is based on the estimated market values of the respective goods 
the company periodically reviews the age and turnover of its inventory to determine whether any inventory has declined in value and incurs a charge to operations for such declines 
the company records write downs based on two methodologies  specific write downs on certain items based on declines in the marketplace  and estimated write downs based on a percentage of the inventory aging by category type  unless the company implores a marketing strategy to sell goods over time 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management and the company s estimates prove to be inaccurate  additional write downs or adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
in certain instances  the company holds inventory for a period of time in excess of one year  which is generally based on a marketing strategy to sell collectibles over time in order to avoid flooding the marketplace 
inventories  which are not expected to be sold within one year  are classified with other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets the company records impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired and the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its recorded amount in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company reviews the value of its long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include material adverse changes in operations  significant adverse differences in actual results in comparison with initial valuation forecasts prepared at the time of acquisition  a decision to abandon certain acquired products  services or marketplaces  or other significant adverse changes that would indicate the carrying amount of the recorded asset might not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill and other purchased intangibles may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on discounted future cash flows using the company s average cost of funds 
for the year ended june   the company performed this analysis with assistance from an independent valuation expert 
the tests the company performed compared the expected future discounted cash flows for a five year period  to the carrying amount of the long lived assets resulting from purchase business combinations 
in performing these analyses  the company uses the best information available in the circumstances including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
however  it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used  such as future revenue and expense levels  in assessing that value may need to be reevaluated in the case of continued market deterioration  which could result in further impairment of these assets 
effective july   the company will adopt sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement sfas will also require that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  if any  and reviewed for impairment 
upon adoption  the company will re evaluate the future estimated useful lives of its intangible assets that have an indefinite life 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the income tax expense provision 
the company recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered 
the company assesses the likelihood of our deferred tax assets being recovered from future taxable income 
the company then provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which the company do not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased in the future to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on net income in the period in which such determination is made 
new accounting pronouncements refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
safe harbor statement from time to time  information provided by the company  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on behalf of the company  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
the cautionary statements set forth below identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company o the company incurred a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended june  the company is seeking to reduce operating expenses  optimize profitability and align resources with long term business growth strategies  as well as to explore new sources of collectibles in an effort to increase margins and revenues from commissions 
there can be no assurance  however  that these steps or any others will result in a significant improvement in the company s financial condition  on either a short or long term basis particularly in light of generally unfavorable economic conditions and changes in the collectibles marketplace 
o there can be no assurance that the proposed transaction with afinsa will be consummated  or if consummated  on the terms described above 
if the transaction is not consummated  the company will be required to obtain new sources of financing to replace its current credit facility  which expires shortly 
if the company fails to do so on a timely basis and upon satisfactory terms  the company s operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 
o if the revenue of the company fails to offset operating expenses in the future  the company may be required to fund future operations through the sale of additional common stock  which could cause the market price of the stock to decline  as well as have a dilutive effect on the value of the common stock currently outstanding 
o at times there may be a limited supply of collectibles available for sale by the company  and such supply varies from time to time 
while the company generally has not experienced a lack of collectibles that has prevented it from conducting appropriately sized auctions on an acceptable schedule  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain consignments of suitable quantities of collectibles in order to conduct auctions of the size  and at the times  the company may desire in the future 
the company s inability to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company 
o the development and success of the company s business has been and will continue to be dependent substantially upon its president  chairman and chief executive officer  greg manning 
the unavailability of mr 
manning  for any reason  would have a material adverse effect upon the business  operations and prospects of the company if a suitable replacement were not engaged 
o the business of selling stamps  coins  and other collectibles at auction and in retail sales is highly competitive 
the company competes with a number of auction houses and collectibles companies throughout the united states and the world 
while the company believes that there is no dominant company in the stamp auction or collectibles business in which it operates  there can be no assurances that other companies with greater financial and other resources and name recognition will not enter the market 
o the company may be adversely affected by the costs and other effects associated with i legal and administrative cases and proceedings  ii settlements  investigations  claims and changes in those items  and iii adoption of new  or changes in  accounting policies and practices and the application of such policies and practices 
o the company intends to consider appropriate acquisition candidates as described in future planned expansion herein 
there can be no assurance that the company will find or consummate transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future 
o the company s operations may be adversely affected by governmental regulation and taxation of the internet  which is subject to change 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governmental organizations may result in there being enacted laws concerning various aspects of the internet  including online content  user privacy  access charges  liability for third party activities  and jurisdictional issues 
these laws could harm our business by increasing the company s cost of doing business or discouraging use of the internet 
o the company s business will be adversely affected if use of the internet by consumers  particularly purchasers of collectibles  does not continue to grow 
a number of factors may inhibit consumers from using the internet 
these include inadequate network infrastructure  security concerns  inconsistent quality of service and a lack of cost effective high speed service 
even if internet use grows  the internet s infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
in addition  many web sites have experienced service interruptions as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet infrastructure 
if these outages or delays occur frequently in the future  use of the internet  as well as use of the company s web sites  could grow more slowly or decline 
o in addition  the tax treatment of the internet and electronic commerce is currently unsettled 
a number of proposals have been made that could result in internet activities  including the sale of goods and services  being taxed 
the us congress has passed the internet tax information act  which placed a three year moratorium on new state and local taxes on internet commerce and is currently considering extending such moratorium
