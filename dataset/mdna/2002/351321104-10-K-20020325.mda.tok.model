the effective income tax rate on income was for the fifty two weeks ended december  as compared to for the fifty two weeks ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the impact of the credit for social security taxes paid on tips in excess of minimum wage relative to the amount of income before taxes 
quarterly fluctuations  seasonality and inflation as a result of the revenues associated with each new location  the timing of new unit openings will result in significant fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company expects seasonality to be a factor in the operation or results of its business in the future due to expected lower second and third quarter revenues due to the summer season 
the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations include food  liquor and labor costs 
although a large number of the company s restaurant personnel are paid at the federal minimum wage level  the majority of personnel are tipped employees  and therefore  recent as well as future minimum wage changes are likely to have very little effect on labor costs 
as costs of food and labor have increased  the company has historically been able to offset these increases through economies of scale and improved operating procedures 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on operating margins 
liquidity and capital resources the company was formed on february  and  pursuant to the exchange on february   the company became the owner of the eight then existing bailey s locations and three then existing fox and hound locations 
prior to the exchange  bailey s financed its expansion primarily with loans from stockholders and loans from banks 
prior to the exchange  fox and hound financed its expansion primarily with partners equity contributions and loans from related parties 
immediately following the initial public offering  the company repaid outstanding indebtedness to intrust bank  na  wichita  in the principal amount of approximately million out of a total credit line of million available to the company 
this outstanding indebtedness was incurred to refinance the debt of the acquired entities in the exchange of approximately million and to finance the stockholder dividend payment to the former stockholders of bailey s of approximately million 
on september  the company entered into a loan agreement with intrust bank  na the facility which provides for a line of credit of  subject to certain limitations based on earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization of the past fifty two weeks 
the facility requires monthly payments of interest only until november   at which time equal monthly installments of principal and interest are required as necessary to fully amortize the outstanding indebtedness plus future interest over a period of four years 
interest is accrued at a rate of below the prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
proceeds from the facility were used for restaurant development  common stock repurchases  and general corporate purposes 
as of december   the company had borrowed  under the facility 
the company is in compliance with all debt covenants 
cash flows from operations were  in the fifty two weeks ended december  compared to  in the fifty two weeks ended december  this increase is attributable to an increase in net income before the provision for asset impairment to  in the fifty two weeks ended december  compared to net income before the provision for asset impairment to  in the fifty two weeks ended december  purchases of property and equipment were  for the fifty two weeks ended december  compared to  for the fifty two weeks ended december  net payments of the revolving note payable to bank was  for the fifty two weeks december  compared to net payments of  for the fifty two week period ending december  the company spent  to repurchase  shares of common stock in compared to  of common stock repurchases in at december   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
the company intends to open ten to twelve entertainment restaurant locations in and between seven to ten locations in four units have been opened in fiscal  two units are currently under construction and an additional five leases have been executed 
the company is currently evaluating locations in markets familiar to its management team 
however  the number of locations actually opened and the timing thereof may vary depending upon the ability of the company to locate suitable sites and negotiate favorable leases 
the company expects to expend approximately to million to open new locations over the next months 
the company believes the funds available from the facility and its cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in the company s operating plans  the acceleration of the company s expansion plans  lower than anticipated revenues  increased expenses  potential acquisitions or other events will not cause the company to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated  prevent the company from achieving the goals of its expansion strategy or prevent any newly opened locations from operating profitably 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
a summary of the company s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  including debt and lease agreements is presented below 
the long term debt payments represent principal payments only 
the company must also make monthly interest payments on the outstanding debt balance at a rate of below the prime rate as published in the wall street journal at december  
less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt     operating leases      totals      critical accounting policies the company considers determination of impairment of long lived assets as a critical accounting policy because determination as to whether the long lived assets of a restaurant are impaired and  if impaired  the fair value of such assets requires the use of judgment  particularly as it relates to projecting whether the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows for the restaurant over an extended period of time will equal or exceed the carrying value of such assets 
management uses the best information available to make the determination  however  actual future cash flows for the restaurant may vary significantly from the cash flows projected in conjunction with the impairment assessment 
the potential impact on the financial statements of incorrect judgments regarding impairment of long lived assets is that a provision for impairment could be needlessly recorded if projected future cash flows for a restaurant are significantly under estimated or a provision for impairment could be deferred until later determined necessary in a future period if initial projected cash flows are over estimated
