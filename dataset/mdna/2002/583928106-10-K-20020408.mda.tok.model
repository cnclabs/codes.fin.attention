item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended december    and in addition  this section contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions 
certain factors that could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements are set forth below in the investment considerations section 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec has recently issued cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change materially in subsequent periods 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumption that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
significant estimates made by the company include valuation of loans  evaluation of the recoverability of accounts receivable and income tax assets  and the assessment of litigation and other contingencies 
the company s ability to collect accounts receivable and recover the value of its loans depends on a number of factors  including the financial conditions and its ability to enforce provisions of its contracts in the event of disputes  through litigation if necessary  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  to record net assets and liabilities at estimated realizable values 
the matters that give rise to such provisions are inherently uncertain and may require complex and subjective judgments 
although the company believes that estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december   are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statements 
general we are a specialty finance company that originates and services loans that finance taxicab medallions and various types of commercial loans 
we have a leading position in taxicab medallion financing 
since  we have increased our medallion loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of and our commercial loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 
our total assets under our management were approximately million and have grown from million at the end of  a compound annual growth rate of 
the company s loan related earnings depend primarily on its level of net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the total yield on the company s loan portfolio and the average cost of funds 
the company funds its operations through a wide variety of interest bearing sources  such as revolving bank facilities  senior secured notes  and debentures issued to and guaranteed by the sba 
net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on the company s loan portfolio and changes in the cost of funds  as well as changes in the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities held by the company 
net interest income is also affected by economic  regulatory  and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand  and the availability of funding to finance the company s lending activities 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice on a different basis than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company also invests in small businesses in selected industries through its subsidiary mci 
mci s investments are typically in the form of secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by warrants to purchase an equity interest for a nominal exercise price such warrants are included in equity investments 
interest income is earned on the debt investments 
realized gains or losses on investments are recognized when the investments are sold or written off 
the realized gains or losses represent the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio assets  if any  and the cost of such portfolio assets 
in addition  changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments are recorded and represent the net change in the estimated fair values of the portfolio assets at the end of the period as compared with their estimated fair values at the beginning of the period 
generally  realized gains losses on investments and changes in unrealized appreciation depreciation of investments are inversely related 
when an appreciated asset is sold to realize a gain  a decrease in the previously recorded unrealized appreciation occurs 
conversely  when a loss previously recorded as an unrealized loss is realized by the sale or other disposition of a depreciated portfolio asset  the reclassification of the loss from unrealized to realized causes an increase in net unrealized appreciation and an increase in realized loss 
the company s income from the taxicab rooftop advertising business  operated by media is reflected on the company s books as earnings from an unconsolidated subsidiary 
the company continues to explore other opportunities in the taxicab and lending industries  including possible strategies to participate directly and or indirectly in the appreciation of taxicab medallions 
economic conditions in new york city the terrorist attacks on new york city on september   created a tremendous amount of actual and collateral damage to the city  and to the people and businesses who live  work  and operate there 
the slowdown in traffic  tourism  and other personal concerns resulted in initial operating problems for certain of our medallion individual and fleet customers 
it also effected some of our commercial borrowers 
the taxi top advertising business  many of whose ads are from broadway shows  suffered short term contract cancellations from these and other customers which had a gross revenue impact of approximately  during the attacks also further exacerbated the recessionary trends which had become more apparent as unfolded 
the effects of a general economic slowdown has impacted the company as evidenced by an increase in delinquencies and nonperforming loans  increased prepayment activity as borrowers sought lower rate financing with the company or other lenders  and stresses on medallion and other collateral values  primarily in chicago  and by reduced levels of advertising in media 
as a result of the above  the company reassessed the loss potential on the loan portfolio  servicing asset  and other receivables which resulted in charges of  in the third quarter to provide reserves against or writedown the values of these assets which were impacted by the attacks and the recession in the economy 
trend in loan portfolio the company s investment income is driven by the principal amount of and yields on its loan portfolio 
to identify trends in the yields  the portfolio is grouped by medallion loans  commercial loans  and equity investments 
since december   medallion loans  while still making up a significant portion of the total portfolio  have decreased in relation to the total portfolio composition and commercial loans have increased 
the following table illustrates the company s investments at fair value and the weighted average portfolio yields calculated using the contractual interest rates of the loans at the dates indicated december  december  contractual contractual weighted percentage weighted percentage average principal of total average principal of total dollars in thousands yield amount portfolio yield amount portfolio medallion loan portfolio   commercial loan portfolio   equity investments   total portfolio   december  contractual weighted percentage average principal of total dollars in thousands yield amount portfolio medallion loan portfolio  commercial loan portfolio  equity investments  total portfolio  portfolio summary total portfolio yield the weighted average yield of the total portfolio at december  was  which is a decrease of basis points from at december  the decrease primarily reflects the reductions in the general level of interest rates in the economy  demonstrated by the reduction in the prime rate from to during the course of the total weighted average portfolio yield increased basis points to at december  from at december  the increase in the total portfolio yield was due to the increased yield on the commercial loan portfolio and the shift in the composition of the portfolio to an increased percentage of commercial loans 
the company expects to try to continue increasing both the percentage of commercial loans in the total portfolio and the origination of floating and adjustable rate loans and non new york medallion loans 
medallion loan portfolio the company s loans comprised of the total portfolio of  at december   compared to of the total portfolio of  at december  and of the total portfolio of  at december  the medallion loan portfolio decreased by  or in  reflecting a decrease in medallion loan originations  principally in new york city  chicago  and boston  and the company s execution of participation agreements with third parties for  of low yielding new york medallion loans 
the company retains a portion of these participating loans and earns a fee for servicing the loans for the third parties 
the weighted average yield of the medallion loan portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was up basis points from at december  the decrease in yields at december  reflects the generally lower level of rates in the economy 
the increased yield at december   primarily reflected the company s expansion into markets outside of new york  which produce yields to basis points higher than loans originated in the new york medallion market  offset by the effects of continuing competition in the new york medallion market 
at december   of the medallion loan portfolio represented loans outside new york compared to and at year end and  respectively 
medallion continues to focus its efforts on originating higher yielding medallion loans outside the new york market 
collateral appreciation participation loans during the first half  the company originated collateral appreciation participation loans collateralized by chicago taxi medallions of  of which  were syndicated to other financial institutions 
in consideration for modifications from its normal taxi medallion lending terms  the company offered loans at higher loan to value ratios and is entitled to earn additional interest income based upon any increase in the value of all  of the collateral 
during  the effect of the economic downturn began to stress the value of chicago taxi medallions  which accelerated as the year progressed 
as a result  the company determined that the previously recorded appreciation was no longer supported by current chicago medallion prices  and therefore adjusted the carrying values down to their original face value of  which represented approximately of its total investment portfolio 
additional interest income was reduced by  for  compared to increases of  and for and  and is reflected in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations and in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
as a regulated investment company  the company is required to mark to market these investments on a quarterly basis  just as it does on all of its other investments 
the company feels that it has adequately calculated the fair market value on these investments in each accounting period  by relying upon information such as recent and historical medallion sale prices 
the loans are due in march  but may be prepaid at the borrowers option 
if that occurs  the company expects to refinance the loans with the existing borrower  including the syndicated portion  at that time at the rates and terms prevailing at that time 
commercial loan portfolio since  the company has continued to shift the total portfolio mix toward a higher percentage of commercial loans  which historically have had higher yields than its medallion loans 
commercial loans were of the total portfolio at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the commercial loan portfolio continued to experience strong growth in the asset based lending portfolio and the mezzanine financing business  which was more than offset by the decline in the other commercial lending segments 
the overall decline in the commercial lending business reflects the chargeoff of  of fully reserved loans during  and the slowdown in originations due to liquidity constraints during the first part of the weighted average yield of the commercial loan portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was up basis points from at december  the decrease in and the increase in primarily reflected a shift in the mix within the commercial portfolio from fixed rate loans to floating rate or adjustable rate loans tied to the prime rate  and the corresponding sensitivity of the yield to movements in the prime rate  which fell basis points during after rising for much of the company continues to originate adjustable rate and floating rate loans tied to the prime rate to help mitigate its interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment 
at december   floating rate loans represented approximately of the commercial portfolio compared to and at december  and although this strategy initially produces a lower yield  we believe that this strategy mitigates interest rate risk by better matching our earning assets to their adjustable rate funding sources 
equity investments equity investments were   and of medallion s total portfolio at december    and equity investments are comprised of common stock and warrants 
investment in and loans to unconsolidated subsidiaries the investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries represents the company s investment in its taxicab advertising business  media 
trend in interest expense the company s interest expense is driven by the interest rate payable on its libor based short term credit facilities with bank syndicates  long term notes payable  fixed rate  long term debentures issued to or guaranteed by the sba  and  to a lesser degree  secured commercial paper 
as a result of the recent amendments to the bank lines of credit and senior secured notes  the company s cost of funds will increase in until the debts mature and are paid off 
as noted above  the amendments entered into during to the company s bank loans and senior secured notes involved changes  and in some cases increases  to the interest rates payable thereunder 
in addition  during events of default  the interest rate borne on the bank loans is based upon a margin over the prime rate rather than libor 
the bank loans are priced on a grid depending on leverage and were at libor plus basis points for the company and libor plus basis points for mfc as of april  the senior secured notes adjusted to effective march   and thereafter adjust upwards an additional basis points on a quarterly basis until maturity 
in addition to the interest rate charges   has been incurred through april  for attorneys and other professional advisors  most working on behalf of the lenders  which will be expensed over the remaining lives of the related debt outstanding 
the company s cost of funds is primarily driven by the rates paid on its various debt instruments and their relative mix and changes in the levels of average borrowings outstanding 
the company incurs libor based debt for terms generally ranging from days 
the company s debentures issued to the sba typically have initial terms of ten years 
the company measures its cost of funds as its aggregate interest expense for all of its interest bearing liabilities divided by the average amount of such liabilities outstanding during the period 
the following table shows the average borrowings and related costs of funds for   and average balances have declined during  primarily reflecting the initial use of the equity proceeds raised during for debt reductions and the growth in participations sold to other financial institutions to raise capital for debt reductions and other corporate purposes 
the decline in the costs of funds reflects the trend of declining interest rates in the economy  partially offset by the switch from lower cost commercial paper to higher cost bank debt and related renewal expenses  and additional long term sba debt also at higher rates 
percentage of total average average interest interest balance cost of funds expense expense december  notes payable to banks   senior secured notes   sba debentures   commercial paper   total   december  notes payable to banks   commercial paper   senior secured notes   sba debentures   total   december  notes payable to banks   commercial paper   sba debentures   senior secured notes   total   the company will continue to seek sba funding to the extent it offers attractive rates 
sba financing subjects its recipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur 
the company uses sba funding to fund loans that qualify under the sbia and sba regulations 
further  the company believes that its transition to financing operations primarily with short term libor based secured bank debt has generally decreased its interest expense  but has also increased the company s exposure to the risk of increases in market interest rates  which the company mitigates with certain hedging strategies 
at december  and  short term libor based debt including commercial paper constituted  and of total debt  respectively 
taxicab advertising in addition to its finance business  the company also conducts a taxicab rooftop advertising business through media  which began operations in november media s revenue is affected by the number of taxicab rooftop advertising displays  currently showing advertisements  and the rate charged customers for those displays 
at december   media had approximately  installed displays in the us 
the company expects that media will continue to expand its operations by entering new markets on its own or through acquisition of existing taxicab rooftop advertising companies 
although media is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  its results of operations are not consolidated with the company s operations because the securities and exchange commission regulations prohibit the consolidation of non investment companies with investment companies 
during  media s operations were constrained by a very difficult advertising environment compounded by the rapid expansions of tops inventory that occurred during and media began to recognize losses as growth in operating expenses exceeded growth in revenue 
also  a substantial portion of media s revenues in arose from the realization of amounts that had been paid for and deferred from prior periods 
media is actively pursuing new sales opportunities  including expansion and upgrading of the sales force  and has taken steps to reduce operating expenses  including renegotiation of fleet payments for advertising rights  to better align ongoing revenues and expenses  and to maximize cash flow from operations 
media s growth prospects are currently constrained by the operating environment and distressed advertising market that resulted from september th and the economic downturn  which has resulted in operating losses and a drain on cash flow  as well as the limitation on funding that can be provided by the company in accordance with the terms of the bank agreements 
media has developed an operating plan to fund only necessary operations out of available cash flow and to escalate its sales activities to generate new revenues 
although there can be no assurances  media and the company believe that this plan will enable media to weather this downturn in the advertising cycle and maintain operations at existing levels until such times as business returns to historical levels 
in july  media acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of mmj  a taxi advertising operation similar to those operated by media in the us  which has advertising rights on approximately  cabs  rooftop displays and  interior racks servicing various cities in japan 
the terms of the agreement provide for an earn out payment to the sellers based on average net income over the next three years 
factors affecting net assets factors that affect the company s net assets include  net realized gain or loss on investments and change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments 
net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds derived upon sale or foreclosure of a loan or an equity investment and the cost basis of such loan or equity investment 
change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments is the amount  if any  by which the company s estimate of the fair value of its investment portfolio is above or below the previously established fair value or the cost basis of the portfolio 
under the act and the sbia  the company s loan portfolio and other investments must be recorded at fair value 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses  but adjusts quarterly the valuation of our loan portfolio to reflect the company s estimate of the current value of the total loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for the company s loans  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of the company 
in determining such fair value  the company and its board of directors takes into consideration factors such as the financial condition of its borrowers and the adequacy of its collateral 
any change in the fair value of portfolio loans or other investments as determined by the company is reflected in net unrealized depreciation or appreciation of investments and affects net increase in net assets resulting from operations but has no impact on net investment income or distributable income 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and net assets resulting from operations of  or per common share  decreased  from  or per share in  reflecting decreased net interest and non interest income  and higher levels of net realized unrealized losses on the investment portfolios  partially offset by reduced operating expenses 
included in the results for were charges of  primarily relating to valuation assessments the company made in regards to the future realizability of asset values in light of the september  terrorist attacks and their impact on new york city and the company s operations  compounded by the recessionary forces battering the economy  including the sharp reduction in interest rates and their effect on prepayment levels 
the charges included  to increase unrealized depreciation to reflect the impact of the economic forces on delinquency trends  reduced payment levels  and collateral values   to writedown the value of collateral appreciation participation loans to reflect recent transaction activity in chicago medallions   to reflect acceleration in the deterioration in the prepayment speeds on the company s servicing asset receivable   to reserve against the risks of future realization of previously recorded deferred tax benefits related to media s operations   related to additional bank charges for new amendments to our borrowing agreements and higher pricing  and  related to the write off of previously capitalized transaction costs that are no longer expected to close 
likewise  results included one time charges of  related to acquisition related matters  the termination of certain capital markets activities  and the costs of amending our borrowing agreements with our bank group  fully offset by income of  reflecting the write up in the value of collateral appreciation participation loans 
excluding the impact of these charges  net increase in net assets resulting from operations was  or per share  a decrease of  or compared to investment income was  down  or from  in the decrease compared to primarily reflected the  swing in values of the collateral appreciation participation loans from early to late  as well as lower yields on the portfolio primarily due to the lower interest rate environment in  a decreased level of loans  and a higher level of nonaccrual loans 
total net investments at year end were  down  or from the yield on the total portfolio during was  compared to for  a decline of basis points 
the decrease primarily reflected the reduction in additional interest income related to the collateral appreciation loans and the series of rate drops initiated by the federal reserve bank during late and continuing through  which reduced the prime lending rate by basis points 
adjusted for the effects of the additional income recorded on the collateral appreciation participation loans  the yields were and for and  respectively  a decline of basis points 
partially offsetting the decreased yield was the continuing movement of portfolio composition towards higher yielding commercial loans from lower yielding medallion loans 
commercial loans represented of the investment portfolio at december   compared to at december  yields on medallion loans were at yearend  compared to at yearend  and yields on commercial loans were compared to for medallion loans were  at yearend  down  or from  at the end of  reflecting reductions in most markets 
the commercial loan portfolio was  at yearend  compared to  for a decrease of  or  reflecting reductions in all commercial lending categories except asset based receivable lending which increased  or 
in general  the decrease in the loan portfolios was a result of the bank lenders requiring the company to reduce the level of outstandings in the revolving lines of credit 
during the first half  the company originated collateral appreciation participation loans collateralized by chicago taxi medallions of  of which  was syndicated to other financial institutions

interest expense was  in  down  or from  in  primarily reflecting a switch from lower cost commercial paper to higher cost bank debt and sba debentures  and higher bank fees and charges related to the renewals and amendments of the bank loans  partially offset by lower rates and lower average balances outstanding 
the company s borrowings from its bank lenders generally were repriced during the year as a result of the negotiations and amendments to the bank facilities 
the impact of all of this was to increase the company s cost of funds by  or basis points 
outstanding balances under all financing arrangements decreased  or during to  from  in the company s debt is primarily tied to floating rate indexes  which rose during most of  and began declining thereafter 
the company s average cost of funds was in  compared to a year ago  a decrease of basis points

see page for a table which shows average balances and cost of funds for the company s funding sources 
net interest income was  and net interest margin was in  down  or from  or in  primarily reflecting the  difference in additional interest income on the collateral appreciation participation loans and the decreases in yields and balances in the loan portfolio  partially offset by lower borrowing costs associated with reduced levels of borrowings at lower rates of interest

to the extent that media cannot generate additional advertising revenue to replace the deferred revenue recorded in  media s results of operations may be negatively impacted

this revenue was recognized upon determination that media had no further continued obligations under the contract

steps taken included the resolution of the material weaknesses identified from the financial audit  the hiring of a strong new cadre of senior management  the initiating of a dialogue with the company s lending syndicates as to borrowing conditions  and the reassessment of strategic initiatives both underway and anticipated in the future

asset liability management interest rate sensitivity the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its interest earning assets consisting of medallion loans and commercial loans reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of credit facilities with bank syndicates  senior secured notes  and subordinated sba debentures 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from the company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets 
the company s interest rate sensitive assets were  and interest rate sensitive liabilities were  at december  the one year cumulative interest rate gap was negative  or of interest rate sensitive assets 
having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  the company anticipates that approximately of the portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
the company believes that the average life of its loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
the following schedule of principal payments sets forth at december  the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the time periods indicated 
the principal amount of medallion loans and commercial loans are assigned to the time frames in which such principal amounts are contractually obligated to be paid 
the company has not reflected an assumed annual prepayment rate for medallion loans or commercial loans in this table

we entered into an interest rate cap agreement on a notional amount of  limiting our maximum libor exposure on our revolving credit facility until june  to 
total premiums paid under the interest rate cap agreements have been expensed 
the company will seek to manage interest rate risk by originating adjustable rate loans  by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  by evaluating appropriate derivatives  pursuing securitization opportunities  and by other options consistent with managing interest rate risk 
in addition  the company manages its exposure to increases in market rates of interest by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  such as five year senior secured notes and ten year subordinated sba debentures 
the company had outstanding  of senior secured notes at december   half of which were to mature june   with the balance maturing on september  at a fixed interest rate of and sba debentures in the principal amount of  with a weighted average interest rate of 
at december   these notes and debentures each constituted of the company s total indebtedness

as a ric  we distribute at least of our investment company taxable income  consequently  we primarily rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
at december   our  of outstanding debt was comprised as follows bank debt  at variable effective interest rates with an weighted average interest rate of  long term senior secured notes fixed at an interest rate of  and subordinated sba debentures with fixed rates of interest with an annual weighted average rate of 
in may  the company applied for and received million of additional funding with the sba  to be committed by the sba in total for the company  subject to the infusion of additional equity capital into the respective subsidiaries 
since sba financing subjects its recipients to certain regulations  the company will seek funding at the subsidiary level to maximize its benefits 
financing arrangements the company s bank loan matured on november  in addition  mfc was in default under its bank loan and its senior secured notes 
in april   the company and mfc obtained amendments to their bank loans and senior secured notes 
the amendments  in general  changed the maturity dates of the loans and notes  modified the interest rates borne on the secured notes  required certain immediate  scheduled or other prepayments of the loans and notes and reductions in the commitments under the bank loans  required the company or mfc to engage or seek to engage in certain asset sales  instituted additional operating restrictions and reporting requirements 
as modified by the amendments  the scheduled amortization on the lines of credit and secured notes are as follows maturity principal payments monthly principal outstanding from from outstanding at december  january  july at and after march  april  may  may june  june  medallion financial loans     mfc loans    mfc loans senior secured notes      total       in addition to the changes in maturity acceleration of maturity dates in the case of mfc  the interest rates on the company s bank loan and mfc s secured notes were increased  and additional fees were charged to renew and maintain the facilities and notes 
the recent amendments contain substantial limitations on our ability to operate and in some cases require modifications to our previous normal course of operations 
covenants restricting investment in the media and bll subsidiaries  elimination of various intercompany balances between affiliates  limits on the amount and timing of dividends  and continuation of the prior financial and operating covenants were all tightened as a condition of renewal 
while we have experienced difficulty complying with the restrictive covenants under our existing agreements  the company believes it will be able to comply with all provisions of the amended agreements  including the accelerated maturity schedule 
as of march   the company had  of cash on hand 
we may need to sell assets to meet the amortization requirements under these amendments 
while we fully intend to comply with the covenants in recent amendments  we have failed to comply with similar covenants in our existing agreements 
we are currently exploring refinancing options which would replace our obligations under the company and mfc loans and the senior secured notes 
we have signed a non binding preliminary term sheet and we are currently engaged in discussions  and have received a proposal from  a nationally known asset based lender to provide a refinancing for the obligations owed under our secured notes and bank loans 
the proposed financing would enable the company to refinance its existing indebtedness and provide additional capital with longer maturities  but there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtained  the date that it will be obtained or whether such financing would provide more operating flexibility than is provided under our current credit agreements 
the failure to obtain such financing or alternative financing on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company is actively pursuing other financing options for individual subsidiaries with alternate financing sources  and is continuing the ongoing program of loan participations and sales to provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth 
the company has also received non binding preliminary offers from other nationally recognized lenders to refinance certain subsidiaries of the company 
furthermore  the company is considering the possibility of submitting an application to receive a bank charter  which if granted  would permit the company to receive deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
the company has held meetings with the relevant regulatory bodies in connection with such an application 
there can be no assurances that such financings will be obtained or that any application related to a bank charter would be approved 
the company believes that its credit facilities with the sba and cash flow from operations after distributions to stockholders will be adequate to fund the continuing operation of the company 
as a result of the recent amendments to the bank loans and senior secured notes  the company s cost of funds will increase in until the debts mature and are paid off 
as noted above  the amendments entered into during to the company s bank loans and senior secured notes involved changes  and in some cases increases  to the interest rates payable thereunder 
in addition  during events of default  the interest rate borne by the bank loans is based upon a margin over the prime rate rather than libor 
the bank loans are priced on a grid depending on leverage and were at libor plus basis points for the company and libor plus basis points for mfc as of april  the senior secured notes adjusted to effective march   and thereafter adjust upwards an additional basis points on a quarterly basis until maturity 
in addition to the interest rate charges   has been incurred for attorneys and other professional advisors  most working on behalf of the lenders  which generally will be expensed over the remaining lives of the related debt outstanding 
we are a party to three financing agreements the second amended and second amended and restated loan agreement  dated as of september   among the company  medallion business credit  llc and the parties thereto the company bank loan  the amended and restated loan agreement  dated as of december   as amended  among mfc and the parties thereto the mfc bank loan  and the note purchase agreements  each dated as of june   as amended  between the company and the note purchasers thereto the mfc note agreements 
in the fourth quarter of  the company bank loan matured  and mfc was in default under both the mfc bank loan and the mfc note agreements 
in  the company and mfc entered into amendments to such agreements 
in addition to imposing maturities and scheduled amortization requirements  the amendments also instituted various other prepayment requirements a the company is required to repay to mfc an intercompany receivable in excess of million by may   and b mfc is required to use its best efforts to sell a portion its laundromat and dry cleaning loans in its commercial loan portfolio by may   and its chicago yellow cab loan portfolio before november  the proceeds from these repayments and sales must be used to repay the company s or mfc s indebtedness  as applicable 
in addition  the amendments require mfc to further amend the mfc note agreements and the mfc bank loan to provide for periodic prepayments of the indebtedness thereunder out of excess cash flow 
the company bank loan  mfc bank loan  and the mfc note agreements contain substantial limitations on our ability to operate and in some cases require modifications to our previous normal course of operations 
under all of the agreements  if our outstanding debt exceeds the borrowing base  as defined in each agreement  then we must repay the outstanding indebtedness that exceeds the borrowing base within five business days 
the agreements  collectively  also contain financial covenants  including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  maximum combined leverage ratio  minimum ebit to interest expense ratio  minimum asset quality ratio  minimum tangible net worth and maximum losses of media 
the agreements also impose limitations on ability to incur liens and indebtedness  merge  consolidate  sell or transfer asset  loan and invest in third parties and our subsidiaries  repurchase or redeem stock  purchase portfolios  acquire other entities  amend certain material agreements  make capital expenditures  have outstanding intercompany receivables and securitize our assets 
they prohibit a the company and mfc from paying dividends prior to july   b mfc from paying more than million of dividends between july  and september  and c the company from paying dividends after september  unless it certifies that it will be in pro forma compliance with amortization requirements for the remainder of after paying the dividend 
lastly  the agreements limit the amount of investments we can make in our subsidiaries and the creation of new subsidiaries 
the company paid amendment fees of  and mfc paid amendment fees of  and is obligated to pay an additional amendment fee on june  equal to of the amount outstanding under the mfc bank loan and the mfc note agreements 
additionally  under the mfc note agreements and mfc bank loan  mfc is obligated to pay the lenders and note holders an aggregate monthly fee of  commencing on june  and increasing by  each month 
we are currently engaged in discussions  and have received a proposal from  a nationally known asset based lender to provide a refinancing for the obligations owed under our term loan and revolving credit agreement  but there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtained  the date that it will obtained or whether such financing would provide more operating flexibility than is provided under our current credit agreements 
the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by the company s board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike banks  the company is not permitted to provide a general reserve for anticipated loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company will record unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection of the loan is unlikely 
the company will record unrealized appreciation on equities if it has a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  the company s security has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts quarterly the valuation of the portfolio to reflect the board of directors estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized gains losses 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
in addition  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with short term floating rate debt  and to a lesser extent with long term fixed rate debt 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have affected net increase decrease in assets by less than over a six month horizon 
although management believes that this measure is indicative of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase decrease in assets 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate 
on november   fitch ibca placed medallion s bbb senior secured debt rating and f secured commercial paper rating on negative watch 
in addition  in december  the company s other rating agency  thompson s bankwatch  was acquired by fitch ibca  leaving it with only one commercial paper rating 
primarily as a result of these factors  a substantial portion of the company s commercial paper did not rollover and has subsequently been replaced by company s bank facility 
on january   fitch ibca lowered our senior secured debt rating and secured commercial paper rating to bb and b  respectively  and removed them from negative watch 
during the third quarter the commercial paper program matured and was terminated 
during the second and third quarters  the company completed an equity offering of  common shares at per share raising over  of additional capital 
the company continues to work with investment banking firms to investigate the viability of a number of other financing options which include  among others  the sale or spin off certain assets or divisions  and the development of a securitization conduit program 
these financing options would also provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth 
if none of these financing options occur  management believes liquidity would still be adequate to fund the continuing operations of the company s loan portfolio and advertising businesses

in connection with the maturity of the revolving line described in above  the terms of the senior secured notes were renegotiated on march   generally providing for  of principal payments  higher levels of interest  and accelerated final maturities of june  from june and september as well as required scheduled amortization and asset sales 
loan amortization  prepayments  and sales also provide a source of funding for the company 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  medallion loan market rates  economic conditions  and competition 
medallion loan prepayments have slowed since early  initially because of increases  and then stabilization  in the level of interest rates  and more recently because of an increase in the percentage of medallion loans  which are refinanced with the company rather than through other sources of financing 
loan sales are a major focus of the sba section a loan program conducted by bll  which is primarily set up to originate and sell loans 
increases in sba a loan balances in any given period generally reflect timing differences in selling and closing transactions

the notes bear a fixed rate of interest of and interest is paid quarterly in arrears 
the notes rank pari passu with the revolvers and commercial paper through inter creditor agreements 
the proceeds of the notes were used to prepay certain of the company s outstanding sba debentures

media funds its operations through internal cash flow and inter company debt 
media is not a ric and  therefore  is able to retain earnings to finance growth 
media s growth prospects are currently constrained by the operating environment and distressed advertising market that resulted from september th and the economic downturn  which has resulted in operating losses and a reduced cash flow  as well as restrictions on funding that can be provided by the company in accordance with the terms of the bank loans 
media has developed an operating plan to fund only necessary operations out of available cash flow and to escalate its sales activities to generate new revenues 
although there can be no assurances  media and the company believe that this plan will enable media to weather this downturn in the advertising cycle and maintain operations at existing levels until such times as business returns to historical levels

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes an accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is evaluating the impact from adoption of these accounting standards 
at december   the company had  of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet and  recorded on the balance sheet of media  its wholly owned subsidiary that will be subject to the asset impairment review required by sfas investment considerations interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the interest rate spread we receive on our taxicab medallion and commercial loans 
because we borrow money to finance the origination of loans  our income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan funds 
while the loans in our portfolio in most cases bear interest at fixed rates or adjustable rates  we finance a substantial portion of such loans by incurring indebtedness with floating interest rates which adjust at various intervals 
as a result  our debt may adjust to a change in interest rates more quickly than the loans in our portfolio 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our costs of funds would increase  which would reduce our portfolio income before net realized and unrealized gains 
accordingly  we  like most financial services companies  face the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate caps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
in addition  we rely on our counterparties to perform their obligations under such interest rate caps 
a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments  which could adversely affect our business 
our borrowers generally have the right to prepay their loans upon payment of a fee ranging from to days interest 
a borrower is likely to exercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
in a lower interest rate environment  we will have difficulty re lending prepaid funds at comparable rates  which may reduce the net interest spread we receive 
because we must distribute our income  we have a continuing need for capital 
we have a continuing need for capital to finance our lending activities 
our current sources of capital and liquidity are the following 
bank credit facilities  
senior secured notes  
fixed rate  long term sba debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba  
sales of participations in loans  and 
loan amortization and prepayments 

follow on equity offering as a regulated investment company ric  we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income 
consequently  we primarily rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
at december   we had  available under outstanding commitments from the sba 
we may have difficulty raising capital to finance our planned level of lending operations 
subsequent to december   the agreements providing the bank loans for the company and mfc were amended to a provide  with respect to the company bank loan  for a may  maturity date  with commitment reductions to approximately   and  on march   april  and may   and b provide  with respect to the bank loan  for a june  maturity date subject to conversion of amounts outstanding on june  into a one year term loan with a commitment reduction to  on april  see additional discussion related to the company s bank loans and note agreements in the liquidity and capital resources section on page lending to small businesses involves a high degree of risk and is highly speculative 
our commercial loan activity has increased in recent years 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk  which can result in substantial losses and should be considered speculative 
our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that have limited resources and that are generally unable to achieve financing from traditional sources 
there is generally no publicly available information about these small business owners  and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions 
in addition  these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements 
some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition 
therefore  they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences  market conditions or economic downturns  which may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
our borrowers may default on their loans 
we primarily invest in and lend to companies that may have limited financial resources 
numerous factors may affect a borrower s ability to repay its loan  including 
the failure to meet its business plan  
a downturn in its industry or negative economic conditions  
the death  disability or resignation of one or more of the key members of management  or 
the inability to obtain additional financing from traditional sources 
deterioration in a borrower s financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration in the collateral for the loan 
expansion of our portfolio and increases in the proportion of our portfolio consisting of commercial loans could have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the portfolio 
we borrow money  which may increase the risk of investing in our common stock 
we use financial leverage through bank syndicates  our senior secured notes  and our long term  subordinated sba debentures 
leverage poses certain risks for our stockholders 
it may result in higher volatility of both our net asset value and the market price of our common stock  
since interest is paid to our creditors before any income is distributed to our stockholders  fluctuations in the interest payable to our creditors may decrease the dividends and distributions to our stockholders  and 
in the event of a liquidation of the company  our creditors would have claims on our assets superior to the claims of our stockholders 
our failure to remedy certain internal control deficiencies could have an adverse affect on our business operations 
consistent with the company s on going focus on improving its operations and growth  and at the request of bll s regulatory authority  the connecticut banking department the department  the board of directors of bll is currently adopting plans to improve its financial operations 
the company feels these plans will be viewed favorably by the department 
if we are unable to continue to diversify geographically  our business may be adversely affected if the new york taxicab industry continues to experience an economic downturn 
although we are diversifying from the new york city area  a significant portion of our taxicab advertising and loan revenue is derived from new york city taxicabs and medallion loans collateralized by new york city taxicab medallions 
an economic downturn in the new york city taxicab industry could lead to an increase in defaults on our medallion loans and may also adversely affect the operation of our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sufficiently diversify our operations geographically 
if the current economic downturn continues  our commercial loan customers may experience difficulty in servicing their debt with us and the level of our delinquencies and loan losses may increase the economic downturn has resulted in certain of our commercial loan customers experiencing declines in business activities  which could lead to difficulties in their servicing of their loans with us 
if the economic downturn continues  the level of delinquencies  defaults  and loan losses in commercial loan portfolio could increase 
the terrorist attack on new york city on september  and the economic downturn have affected our revenues by increasing loan delinquencies and non performing loans  increasing prepayments  stressing collateral value and decreasing taxi advertising 
although the company believes the estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december   are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statement 
the loss of certain key members of our senior management could adversely affect us 
our success is largely dependent upon the efforts of senior management 
the death  incapacity  or loss of the services of certain of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our operation and financial results 
there can be no assurance that other qualified officers could be hired 
acquisitions may lead to difficulties that could adversely affect our operations 
by their nature  corporate acquisitions entail certain risks  including those relating to undisclosed liabilities  the entry into new markets  and personnel matters 
we may have difficulty integrating the acquired operations or managing problems due to sudden increases in the size of our loan portfolio 
in such instances  we might be required to modify our operating systems and procedures  hire additional staff  obtain and integrate new equipment and complete other tasks appropriate for the assimilation of new business activities 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful  if and when necessary  in minimizing these inherent risks or in establishing systems and procedures which will enable us to effectively achieve our desired results in respect of any of these or any future acquisitions 
competition from entities with greater resources and less regulatory restrictions may decrease our profitability 
we compete with banks  credit unions  and other finance companies  some of which are small business investment companies  or sbics  in the origination of taxicab medallion loans and commercial loans 
we also compete with finance subsidiaries of equipment manufacturers 
many of these competitors have greater resources than the company and certain competitors are subject to less restrictive regulations than the company 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify and complete financing transactions that will permit us to continue to compete successfully 
our taxicab rooftop advertising business competes with other taxicab rooftop advertisers as well as with all segments of the out of home advertising industry 
we also compete with other types of advertising media  including cable and network television  radio  newspapers  magazines and direct mail marketing 
certain of these competitors have also entered into the rooftop advertising business 
many of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and offer several forms of advertising as well as production facilities 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete with these businesses successfully 
the valuation of our loan portfolio is subjective and we may not be able to recover our estimated value in the event of a foreclosure or sale of a substantial portion of portfolio loans 
under the act  our loan portfolio must be recorded at fair value or marked to market 
unlike other lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  we adjust quarterly the valuation of our portfolio to reflect our estimate of the current realizable value of our loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for this portfolio  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of our management and the approval of our board of directors 
because of the subjectivity of these estimates  there can be no assurance that in the event of a foreclosure or the sale of portfolio loans we would be able to recover the amounts reflected on our balance sheet 
if liquidity constraints required the sale of a substantial portion of the portfolio such an action may require the sale of certain assets at amounts less than their carrying amounts 
in determining the value of our portfolio  the board of directors may take into consideration various factors such as the financial condition of the borrower and the adequacy of the collateral 
for example  in a period of sustained increases in market interest rates  our board of directors could decrease its valuation of the portfolio if the portfolio consists primarily of fixed rate loans 
our valuation procedures are designed to generate values which approximate the value that would have been established by market forces and are therefore subject to uncertainties and variations from reported results 
considering these factors  we have determined that the fair value of our portfolio is below its cost basis 
at december   our net unrealized depreciation on investments was approximately  based upon current market conditions and current loan to value ratios  our board of directors believes that the net unrealized depreciation of investments is adequate to reflect the fair value of the portfolio 
changes in taxicab industry regulations that result in the issuance of additional medallions could lead to a decrease in the value of our medallion loan collateral 
every city in which we originate medallion loans  and most other major cities in the united states  limits the supply of taxicab medallions 
this regulation results in supply restrictions that support the value of medallions 
actions that loosen these restrictions and result in the issuance of additional medallions into a market could decrease the value of medallions in that market 
if this were to occur  the value of the collateral securing our then outstanding medallion loans in that market could be adversely affected 
we are unable to forecast with any degree of certainty whether any potential increases in the supply of medallions will occur 
in new york city  chicago  boston  and in other markets where we originate medallion loans  taxicab fares are generally set by government agencies 
expenses associated with operating taxicabs are largely unregulated 
as a result  the ability of taxicab operators to recoup increases in expenses is limited in the short term 
escalating expenses can render taxicab operations less profitable  and could cause borrowers to default on loans from the company  and could potentially adversely affect the value of the company s collateral 
a significant portion of our taxicab advertising and loan revenue is derived from loans collateralized by new york city taxicab medallions 
according to new york city taxi and limousine commission data  over the past years new york city taxicab medallions have appreciated in value an average of each year 
however  for sustained periods during that time  taxicab medallions have declined in value 
during the year  the value of new york city taxicab medallions has declined by approximately 
our failure to maintain our subchapter m status could lead to a substantial reduction in the amount of income distributed to our shareholders 
we  along with some of our subsidiaries  have qualified as regulated investment companies under subchapter m of the code 
thus  we will not be subject to federal income tax on investment company taxable income which includes  among other things  dividends and interest reduced by deductible expenses distributed to our shareholders 
if we or those of our subsidiaries that are also regulated investment companies were to fail to maintain subchapter m status for any reason  our respective incomes would become fully taxable and a substantial reduction in the amount of income available for distribution to us and to our shareholders would result 
to qualify under subchapter m  we must meet certain income  distribution  and diversification requirements 
however  because we use leverage  we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements set forth in the act 
these asset coverage requirements could  under certain circumstances  prohibit us from making distributions that are necessary to maintain our subchapter m status or require that we reduce our leverage 
in addition  the asset coverage and distribution requirements impose significant cash flow management restrictions on us and limit our ability to retain earnings to cover periods of loss  provide for future growth and pay for extraordinary items 
certain of our loans  including the medallion collateral appreciation participation loans  could also be re characterized in a manner that would generate non qualifying income for purposes of subchapter m 
in this event  if such income exceeds the amount permissible  we could fail to satisfy the requirement that a regulated investment company derive at least of its gross income from qualifying sources  with the result that we would not meet the requirements of subchapter m for qualification as a regulated investment company 
qualification as a regulated investment company under subchapter m is made on an annual basis and  although we and some of our subsidiaries are qualified as regulated investment companies  no assurance can be given that we will each continue to qualify for such treatment 
failure to qualify under subchapter m would subject us to tax on our income and would have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
our sbic subsidiaries may be unable to meet the investment company requirements  which could result in the imposition of an entity level tax 
the small business investment act of regulates some of our subsidiaries 
the small business investment act restricts distributions by an sbic 
our sbic subsidiaries that are also regulated investment companies could be prohibited by sba regulations from making the distributions necessary to qualify as a regulated investment company 
each year  in order to comply with the sba regulations and the regulated investment company distribution requirements  we must request and receive a waiver of the sba s restrictions 
while the current policy of the sba s office of sbic operations is to grant such waivers if the sbic makes certain offsetting adjustments to its paid in capital and surplus accounts  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the sba s policy or that our subsidiaries will have adequate capital to make the required adjustments 
if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain a waiver  compliance with the sba regulations may result in loss of regulated investment company status and a consequent imposition of an entity level tax 
the internal revenue code s diversification requirements may limit our ability to expand our taxicab rooftop advertising business and our medallion collateral appreciation participation loan business 
we intend to continue to pursue an expansion strategy in our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
we believe that there are growth opportunities in this market 
however  the asset diversification requirements under subchapter m could restrict such expansion 
these requirements provide that  as a ric  not more than of the value of our total assets may be invested in the securities other than us government securities or securities of other ric s of any one issuer 
while our investments in our ric subsidiaries are not subject to this diversification test so long as these subsidiaries are ric s  our investment in media is subject to this test 
at the time of our original investment  media represented approximately of our total assets  which is in compliance with the diversification test 
the subsequent growth in the value of media by itself will not re trigger the test even if media represents in excess of of our assets 
however  under subchapter m  the test must be reapplied in the event that we make a subsequent investment in media  lend to it or acquire another taxicab rooftop advertising business 
if we were to fail a subsequent test  we would lose our ric status 
as a result  our maintenance of ric status could limit our ability to expand our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
it will be our policy to expand our advertising business through internally generated growth 
we will only consider an acquisition in this area if we will be able to meet subchapter m s diversification requirements 
the fair value of the collateral appreciation participation loan portfolio at december  was  million  which represented approximately of the total investment portfolio 
we will continue to monitor the levels of these asset types in conjunction with the diversification tests 
we depend on cash flow from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments and other distributions to our shareholders 
we are a holding company and we derive most of our operating income and cash flow from our subsidiaries 
as a result  we rely heavily upon distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to make dividend payments and other distributions to our shareholders 
funds are provided to us by our subsidiaries through dividends and payments on intercompany indebtedness  but there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will be in a position to continue to make these dividend or debt payments 
we operate in a highly regulated environment 
we are regulated by the sec and the sba 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations that govern business development companies  ric s  or sbic s may significantly affect our business 
laws and regulations may be changed from time to time  and the interpretations of the relevant laws and regulations also are subject to change 
any change in the laws or regulations that govern our business could have a material impact on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business activities contain elements of risk 
the company considers the principal types of risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio valuations 
the company considers the management of risk essential to conducting its businesses 
accordingly  the company s risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze the company s risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by the company s board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike banks  the company is not permitted to provide a general reserve for anticipated loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company will record unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection of the loan is unlikely 
the company will record unrealized appreciation on equities if it has a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  the company s security has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts quarterly the valuation of the portfolio to reflect the board of directors estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized gains losses 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
in addition  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with short term floating rate debt  and to a lesser extent with long term fixed rate debt 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have affected net increase decrease in assets by less than over a six month horizon 
although management believes that this measure is indicative of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase decrease in assets 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate
