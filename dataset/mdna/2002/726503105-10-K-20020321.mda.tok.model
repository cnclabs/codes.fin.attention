item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information  see the notes to the historical consolidated financial statements 
overview we were formed in september of to acquire and operate the midstream crude oil business and assets of plains resources inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
on november   we completed our initial public offering and the transactions whereby we became the successor to the business of our predecessor 
we are a master limited partnership and conduct our operations through our wholly owned operating limited partnerships plains marketing  lp  all american pipeline  lp and plains marketing canada  lp in may  management and a group of financial investors entered into a transaction with plains resources to acquire control of our general partner and a majority of the outstanding subordinated units 
the transaction closed in june as a result of this transaction  plains resources ownership in the general partner was reduced from to and  combined with two equity offerings conducted in  plains resources overall effective ownership in the partnership which includes its ownership in common and subordinated units was reduced from to approximately 
see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management 
in addition  certain officers of the general partner who previously were also officers of plains resources terminated their affiliation with plains resources and as a result now devote of their efforts to the management of the partnership 
in connection with the general partner transition  certain equity interests previously granted to management and outside directors vested  resulting in a charge to the partnership s income of approximately million  of which plains resources funded approximately we are engaged in interstate and intrastate transportation  marketing and terminalling and storage of crude oil and marketing of liquefied petroleum gas 
pipeline operations 
our activities from pipeline operations generally consist of transporting third party volumes of crude oil for a fee  third party leases of pipeline capacity  barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements 
we also utilize our pipelines in our merchant activities conducted under our gathering and marketing business 
utilization of our pipelines in our gathering and marketing business provides us with a competitive advantage over third party gatherers that do not have similarly located pipelines  because generally it costs less to transport crude oil on pipelines than alternative methods of transportation 
tariffs and other fees on our pipeline systems vary by receipt point and delivery point 
the gross margin generated by our tariff and other fee related activities depends on the volumes transported on the pipeline and the level of the tariff and other fees charged  as well as the fixed and variable costs of operating the pipeline 
gross margin from our pipeline capacity leases  barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements generally reflect a negotiated amount 
terminalling and storage activities and gathering and marketing activities 
terminals are facilities where crude oil is transferred to or from storage or a transportation system  such as a pipeline  to another transportation system  such as trucks or another pipeline 
the operation of these facilities is called terminalling 
gross margin from terminalling and storage activities is dependent on the throughput volumes  the volume of crude oil stored and the level of fees generated from our terminalling and storage services 
gross margin from our gathering and marketing activities is dependent on our ability to sell crude oil at a price in excess of our aggregate cost 
these operations are margin businesses  and are not directly affected by the absolute level of crude oil prices  but are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for crude oil and fluctuations in market related indices 
during periods when the demand for crude oil is weak on a relative basis as was the case in the first quarter of and the last nine months of  the market for crude oil is often in contango  meaning that the price of crude oil for future deliveries is higher than current prices 
a contango market has a generally negative impact on marketing margins  but is favorable to the storage business  because storage owners at major trading locations such as the cushing interchange can simultaneously purchase production at current prices for storage and sell at higher prices for future delivery 
when there is a higher demand than supply of crude oil in the near term  the market is backward  meaning that the price of crude oil for future deliveries is lower than current prices 
a backward market has a positive impact on marketing margins because crude oil gatherers can capture a premium for prompt deliveries 
in this environment  there is little incentive to store crude oil  as current prices are above future delivery prices 
we believe that the combination of our terminalling and storage activities and gathering and marketing activities provides a counter cyclical balance that has a stabilizing effect on our operations and cash flow 
we establish a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies  or by entering into a future delivery obligation with respect to futures contracts on the nymex 
through these transactions  we establish on a monthly basis a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases and sales and future delivery obligations 
we purchase crude oil on both a fixed and floating price basis 
as fixed price barrels are purchased  we enter into sales arrangements with refiners  trade partners or on the nymex  which establishes a margin and protects it against future price fluctuations 
when floating price barrels are purchased  we match those contracts with similar type sales agreements with our customers  or likewise establish a hedge position using the nymex futures market 
from time to time  we enter into arrangements that expose us to basis risk 
basis risk occurs when crude oil is purchased based on a crude oil specification and location that differs from the countervailing sales arrangement 
in order to lock in profits involving our physical assets and to manage risks associated with our crude purchase obligations  we use derivative instruments 
except for pre defined inventory positions as discussed below  our policy is to purchase only crude oil for which we have a market  and to structure our sales contracts so that crude oil price fluctuations do not materially affect the gross margin we receive 
see items and  business and properties crude oil volatility  counter cyclical balance  risk management 
in november  we discovered that this policy was violated 
see items and business and properties unauthorized trading losses and unauthorized trading losses below 
except for inventory transactions not to exceed  barrels  we do not acquire and hold crude oil futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 
acquisitions we completed a number of acquisitions in that impacted the results of operations discussed in this section 
we continue to have an active acquisition program and have completed two acquisitions in as of march see items and business and properties acquisitions and dispositions 
wapella pipeline system in december  we consummated the acquisition of the wapella pipeline system from private investors for approximately million  including transaction costs 
the system is located in southeastern saskatchewan and southwestern manitoba 
in  the wapella pipeline system delivered approximately  barrels per day of crude oil to the enbridge pipeline at cromer  manitoba 
the acquisition also includes approximately  barrels of crude oil storage capacity located along the system as well as a truck terminal 
the wapella acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the purchase price allocation is as follows in thousands crude oil pipeline  gathering and terminal assets  other property and equipment  total  canpet energy group inc in july  we acquired the assets of canpet energy group inc canpet  a calgary based canadian crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas marketing company  for approximately million plus excess inventory at the closing date of approximately million 
approximately million of the purchase price plus million for the additional inventory was paid in cash at closing  and the remainder  which is subject to certain performance standards  will be paid in common units in april  if such standards are met 
at the time of the acquisition  canpet s activities consisted of gathering approximately  barrels per day of crude oil and marketing an average of approximately  barrels per day of natural gas liquids 
assets acquired include a crude oil handling facility  a  barrel tank facility  lpg facilities  existing business relationships and working capital of approximately million 
the canpet acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated in accordance with sfas the purchase price allocation including transaction costs is as follows in thousands inventory  goodwill  intangible assets contracts other assets  including debt issue costs  pipeline linefill  crude oil gathering and terminal assets  other property and equipment total  murphy oil company ltd 
midstream operations in may  we acquired substantially all of the canadian crude oil pipeline  gathering  storage and terminalling assets of murphy oil company ltd 
for approximately million in cash  including financing and transaction costs 
initial financing for the acquisition was provided through borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
the purchase included million for excess inventory in the pipeline systems 
the principal assets acquired include approximately miles of crude oil and condensate mainlines including dual lines on which condensate is shipped for blending purposes and blended crude is shipped in the opposite direction and associated gathering and lateral lines  approximately million barrels of crude oil storage and terminalling capacity located primarily in kerrobert  saskatchewan  approximately  barrels of pipeline linefill and tank inventories  an inactive mile mainline system and trailers used primarily for crude oil transportation 
we have reactivated the mile mainline system and began shipping volumes through that system in may of murphy agreed to continue to transport production from fields previously delivering crude oil to these pipeline systems  under a long term contract 
at the time of acquisition  these volumes averaged approximately  barrels per day 
total volumes transported on the pipeline system in were approximately  barrels per day of light  medium and heavy crudes  as well as condensate 
the murphy acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated in accordance with apb the purchase price allocation  as adjusted pursuant to the provisions of the purchase and sale agreement upon resolution of an outstanding pipeline tariff dispute  is as follows in thousands crude oil pipeline  gathering and terminal assets  pipeline linefill  net working capital items  other property and equipment other assets  including debt issue costs total  unauthorized trading losses in november  we discovered that a former employee had engaged in unauthorized trading activity  resulting in losses of approximately million  which includes estimated associated costs and legal expenses 
approximately million of the unauthorized trading losses was recognized in and the remainder in in  we recognized an additional million charge for litigation related to the unauthorized trading losses 
see items and business and properties unauthorized trading losses for a discussion of the unauthorized trading loss  its financial effects and the steps taken to prevent future violations of our trading policies 
see also item legal proceedings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the critical accounting policies that we have identified are discussed below 
depreciation and amortization we calculate our depreciation and amortization based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
when assets are put into service  we make estimates with respect to useful lives that we believe are reasonable 
however  subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
in conjunction with the recent adoption of sfas  we are required to determine the portion of goodwill or intangibles  relating to acquisitions after june   which have finite lives as opposed to indefinite lives 
intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically assessed for impairment 
the impairment testing entails estimating future net cash flows relating to the asset  based on management s estimate of market conditions including pricing  demand  competition  operating costs and other factors 
intangibles with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life determined by management 
determining the amount of intangibles associated with an acquisition that relates to such items as relationships  contracts  and industry expertise involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on acquisition models and management s assessment of the value of the assets acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we routinely review our receivable balances to identify past due amounts and analyze the reasons such amounts have not been collected 
in many instances  such uncollected amounts involve billing delays and discrepancies or disputes as to the appropriate price  volumes or quality of crude oil delivered  received or exchanged 
we also attempt to monitor changes in the creditworthiness of our customers as a result of developments related to each customer  the industry as a whole and the general economy 
based on these analyses  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and consider the reserve adequate 
revenue and expense accruals we routinely make accruals for both revenues and expenses due to the timing of compiling billing information  receiving third party information and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
the delayed information includes  among other things  actual volumes of crude oil purchased  transported or sold  claims for employee medical insurance  and invoices for purchases and other operating expenses 
in situations where we are required to make mark to market estimates pursuant to sfas  the estimates of gains or losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions  and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction 
we make accruals to reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
liability and contingency accruals we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities including  but not limited to  environmental remediation and potential legal claims 
accruals are made when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome 
these estimates can be increased or decreased as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved 
results of operations analysis of three years ended december  commencing april  july  and october   respectively  the results of operations of the murphy  canpet and wapella acquisitions are included in our results of operations 
the results of operations for the year ended december   include the results of the scurlock acquisition effective may   and the west texas gathering system acquisition effective july  for  we reported net income of million on total revenue of billion compared to net income for of million on total revenue of billion and a net loss for of million on total revenue of billion 
such results include the impacts of unusual  non recurring or extraordinary items as follows 
a million charge associated with the vesting of phantom partnership units primarily as a result of the general partner transition in june see item certain relationships and related transactions transactions with related parties transactions grant agreements 
the vesting had no effect on the number of units outstanding  as the units were satisfied out of units owned by plains resources 
approximately million of the charge included in general and administrative expenses was noncash 
this portion of the charge had no impact on equity as it was offset by a deemed capital contribution by our former general partner  
a million noncash writedown of operating crude oil inventory in the fourth quarter of to reflect prices at december  during  the price of crude oil traded on the nymex averaged per barrel 
at december   the nymex crude oil price was approximately lower  or per barrel 
the partnership uses the average cost method for recording inventory and the noncash writedown reflects the impact of a lower of cost or market valuation  
a million reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  and 
a million gain on the sale of excess communications equipment 

a million gain on the sale of crude oil linefill  
a million gain on the sale of the segment of the all american pipeline that extends from emidio  california  to mccamey  texas  
million of previously deferred gains on interest rate swap terminations recognized due to the early extinguishment of debt  
an extraordinary loss of million related to the early extinguishment of debt  
a million charge for litigation related to the unauthorized trading losses  
a million reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  
amortization of million of debt issue costs associated with facilities put in place during the fourth quarter of subsequent to the unauthorized trading loss  and 
million of noncash compensation expense  attributable to the vesting of rights to receive phantom partnership units granted by an affiliate of plains resources 
see item certain relationships and related transactions transactions with related parties transaction grant agreements 

million of unauthorized trading losses  
a million gain on the sale of crude oil linefill that was sold in  
restructuring expense of million  
an extraordinary loss of million related to the early extinguishment of debt  and 
million of noncash compensation expense attributable to the vesting of phantom partnership units as described for and above 
excluding the items listed above  we would have reported net income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following table sets forth financial and operating information for the periods presented and includes the impact of the items discussed above in thousands year ended december  operating results revenues    gross margin pipeline    terminalling and storage and gathering and marketing    unauthorized trading losses   inventory valuation adjustment  total    general and administrative expense    gross profit    extraordinary item and cumulative effect of accounting change   net income loss    average daily volumes barrels per day pipeline activities all american tariff and fee activities margin activities canada other total lease gathering bulk purchases total terminal throughput storage leased to third parties  monthly average volumes    includes average daily volumes from acquisition effective dates  extrapolated for the full year in which acquisitions were consummated 
revenues 
total revenues were billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
the small increase in as compared to was primarily due to the impact of our canadian acquisitions offset by lower oil prices 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily attributable to lower bulk purchases and exchange volumes associated with our gathering and marketing activities  partially offset by higher crude oil prices 
we significantly reduced the volume of our bulk purchases after our unauthorized trading losses in  because these transactions typically have lower margins  and sellers of the crude oil were requesting letters of credit  which increased our costs on these transactions 
cost of sales and operations 
cost of sales and operations was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
year to year changes were primarily due to the reasons discussed above for revenues 
inventory valuation adjustment 
we recorded a noncash charge of million related to inventory valuation for the year ended december  we utilize an average cost method of valuing our operating inventory 
this charge was required due to the drop in crude oil prices during unauthorized trading losses 
we recognized losses of approximately million and million in and  respectively  as a result of unauthorized trading by a former employee 
see unauthorized trading losses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately  or million as compared to million in g a expenses were million in the overall increase from to is primarily due to a million increase associated with the canadian acquisitions  a million increase in noncash compensation expense  a 
million increase in personnel related expenses  primarily associated with increased insurance costs and additional personnel costs associated with the general partner transition and a million decrease to g a resulting from a reduction year over year in charges to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables 
the overall increase from to is primarily attributable to a million increase associated with the scurlock acquisition in mid  a million charge to expense associated with potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  approximately million of consulting and accounting charges related to the unauthorized trading loss investigation  system modifications and enhancements and implementation of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and a million increase in noncash compensation expense 
during  and  we incurred charges of million  million and million  respectively  related to incentive compensation paid to certain officers and key employees of plains resources and its affiliates 
the incentive compensation charges were noncash except for approximately  in in and  plains resources granted certain officers and key employees the right to earn ownership in our common units owned by it 
these rights provided for a three year vesting period  subject to distributions being paid on the common and subordinated units 
as a result of the change control of the general partner interest  all remaining units vested 
see item certain relationships and related transactions transactions with related parties transaction grant agreements 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  million in and million in excluding the nonrecurring items discussed below  depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million in as compared to primarily as a result of our canadian acquisitions 
approximately million of the increase in as compared to is primarily related to nonrecurring amortization of debt issue costs associated with credit facilities put in place during the fourth quarter of  subsequent to the unauthorized trading losses 
the remaining increase is attributable to the scurlock and west texas gathering system acquisitions  which were effective may   and july   respectively  as well as our and capital additions 
restructuring expense 
we incurred a million restructuring charge in  primarily associated with severance related expenses of employees who were terminated 
as of december   all severance costs were paid and the terminated employees were not employed by us 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest expense is attributable to lower interest rates  as our average debt balance in was slightly higher than in the increase in over is primarily due to higher interest rates as well as slightly higher average debt balances 
during  we capitalized approximately million of interest related to capital projects in the construction phase 
gain on sale of assets 
in march  we sold to a unit of el paso for million the segment of the all american pipeline that extends from emidio  california to mccamey  texas 
except for minor third party volumes  one of our subsidiaries  plains marketing  lp  had been the sole shipper on this segment of the pipeline since its predecessor acquired the line from the goodyear tire rubber company in july we realized net proceeds of approximately million after the associated transaction costs and estimated costs to remove equipment 
we used the proceeds from the sale to reduce outstanding debt 
we recognized a gain of approximately million in connection with the sale 
we had suspended shipments of crude oil on this segment of the pipeline in november at that time  we owned approximately million barrels of crude oil in the segment of the pipeline 
we sold this crude oil from november to february for net proceeds of approximately million  which were used for working capital purposes 
we recognized gains of approximately million and million in and  respectively  in connection with the sale of the linefill 
early extinguishment of debt 
during  we recognized extraordinary losses  consisting primarily of unamortized debt issue costs  totaling million related to the permanent reduction of the all american pipeline  lp term loan facility and the refinancing of our credit facilities 
in addition  interest and other income for the year ended december   includes million of previously deferred gains from terminated interest rate swaps as a result of debt extinguishment 
the extraordinary item of million in relates to the write off of certain debt issue costs and penalties associated with the prepayment of debt 
segment results pipeline operations 
gross margin from pipeline operations was million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately compared to million for and million for the increase in compared to is primarily attributable to the impact of the murphy acquisition 
excluding the murphy acquisition  gross margin from pipeline operations would have increased approximately  due to slightly higher volumes and tariffs  while maintaining operating expenses at a fairly constant level 
gross margin from pipeline operations was negatively impacted on a comparative basis in compared to due to the sale of the california to west texas portion of the all american pipeline  decreased tariff volumes from california ocs production and slightly higher fuel and power charges in these decreases in were partially offset by increased margins from the scurlock and west texas gathering system acquisitions in mid the margin between revenue and direct cost of crude purchased from our pipeline margin activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for and  respectively 
pipeline tariff and fee revenues were approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for and approximately million for pipeline operations and maintenance expenses were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
average daily pipeline volumes totaled  barrels per day   barrels per day and  barrels per day in  and  respectively 
approximately  barrels per day in are attributable to the murphy acquisition 
average daily volumes from the murphy acquisition are included from the effective date of the acquisition  april   extrapolated for the full year 
volumes on the all american pipeline decreased from an average of  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in due to the reasons discussed above 
all american s tariffs volumes attributable to california ocs production were approximately  barrels per day in compared to  barrels per day in volumes from the santa ynez and point arguello fields  both offshore california  have steadily declined from through a  barrel per day decline in volumes shipped from these fields would result in a decrease in annual pipeline tariff revenues of approximately million  based on the average tariff rate 
effective january   the average tariff increased an average of approximately on the all american pipeline 
tariff volumes shipped on the scurlock and west texas gathering systems averaged  barrels per day and  barrels per day in and  respectively 
the period includes average daily volumes for scurlock effective may   and west texas gathering system average daily volumes effective july   in each case extrapolated for the full year 
gathering and marketing activities and terminalling and storage activities 
gross margin from gathering and marketing and terminalling and storage activities was approximately million for the year ended december   excluding the inventory valuation charge reflecting a decrease over the million reported for and a increase over the million reported for gross margin for and exclude the unauthorized trading losses 
the decrease in margin in is primarily attributable to a relatively weak environment for gathering and marketing due to market conditions 
the market conditions during were favorable for gathering and marketing margins 
the increase in gross margin from to is primarily due to a full year of results from the scurlock acquisition and increased per barrel margins due to the strong crude oil market in gross revenues from gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage activities were approximately billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
lease gathering volumes averaged  barrels per day in   barrels per day in and  barrels per day in bulk purchase volumes averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day and  barrels per day in  and  respectively 
the increases in are primarily due to the average daily volumes attributable to our canadian acquisitions from their effective dates  extrapolated for the full year 
the decreases in compared to are due primarily to a significant amount of low margin barrels that were phased out after the discovery of the trading losses  partially offset by increased volumes attributable to the scurlock acquisition  which was effective may  in the period immediately following the disclosure of the unauthorized trading losses  a significant number of our suppliers and trading partners reduced or eliminated the open credit previously extended to us 
consequently  the amount of letters of credit we needed to support the level of our crude oil purchases then in effect increased significantly 
in addition  the cost to us of obtaining letters of credit increased under our credit facility 
in many instances we arranged for letters of credit to secure our obligations to purchase crude oil from our customers  which increased our letter of credit costs and decreased our unit margins 
in other instances  primarily involving lower margin wellhead and bulk purchases  our purchase contracts were terminated 
we estimate that adjusted ebitda and net income was adversely affected by approximately million in as a result of the increase in letter of credit costs and reduced volumes 
currently  our letter of credit requirement levels are lower than those levels existing prior to the unauthorized trading losses 
our senior implied credit ratings from standard and poor s and moody s prior to the unauthorized trading loss were bb and ba  respectively 
as of march   our ratings from these respective agencies were bb and ba terminal throughput  which includes both our cushing and ingleside terminals  was   and  barrels per day for the years ended december   and  respectively 
storage leased to third parties averaged million  million and million barrels per month for the same periods 
liquidity and capital resources cushing terminal expansion we have recently announced the million barrel phase ii and the million barrel phase iii expansions of our cushing terminal facility 
we expect the phase ii expansion will be completed in mid and the phase iii expansion will be completed in late or early the two expansion projects are expected to cost  in the aggregate  approximately million and will expand the total capacity of the facility by to approximately million barrels 
we expect to fund the cost of the expansions from cash generated by operations  working capital and our revolving credit facility 
general cash generated from operations and our credit facilities are our primary sources of liquidity 
at december   we had working capital of approximately million and approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that we have sufficient liquid assets  cash from operations and borrowing capacity under our credit agreements to meet our financial commitments  debt service obligations  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely effect our cash flow 
a material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce a corollary adverse effect on our borrowing capacity 
see risk factors 
cash flows year ended december  in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities in is primarily attributable to inventory purchased and stored in our facilities  for sale and delivery at a later date 
excluding these inventory purchases  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in except for minor amounts  the inventory has been hedged against future price risk by using nymex transactions and fixed price sales contracts 
net cash used in operating activities in and resulted primarily from the unauthorized trading losses 
the losses were partially offset by increased margins due to the scurlock and west texas gathering system acquisitions 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in included million for the acquisitions described above and million primarily for other expansion and acquisition projects 
net cash provided by investing activities for included approximately million of proceeds from the sale of the all american pipeline and pipeline linefill offset by approximately million of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for included approximately million for expansion capital and million for maintenance capital 
net cash used in investing activities for included approximately million for acquisitions  primarily for the scurlock and west texas gathering system acquisitions  million for expansion capital and million for maintenance capital 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of million in short term and long term debt  million for equity issued  the payment of million in distributions to unitholders and the payment of million in financing costs 
cash used in financing activities in consisted primarily of net payments of million of short term and long term debt  the repayment of subordinated debt of million to our former general partner and distributions to unitholders of million 
proceeds used to reduce the bank debt primarily came from the asset sales discussed above 
proceeds to repay the million of subordinated debt to our former general partner came from our revolving credit facility  which was refinanced in may cash provided by financing activities in was generated from net issuances of million in common and class b units  million of short term and long term debt and million of subordinated debt to our former general partner 
financing activities for includes million in distributions to unitholders 
capital expenditures we have made and will continue to make capital expenditures for acquisitions and expansion and maintenance capital 
historically  we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations  bank borrowings and the sale of additional common units 
we estimate aggregate capital expenditures for excluding acquisitions to be approximately million  of which approximately million is attributable to the expansion of our cushing terminal noted above and approximately million is attributable to maintenance capital expenditures 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash from working capital  cash flow from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility under our bank credit agreement to fund these expenditures 
in addition  the partnership has spent approximately million for acquisitions as of march  including million paid in the form of a deposit as of december universal shelf we have filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement that  subject to effectiveness at the time of use  allows us to issue from time to time up to million of debt or equity securities 
in october  we sold approximately million of common units under the shelf 
accordingly  as of march   we have the ability to issue approximately million additional debt or equity securities under this registration statement 
commitments the following table reflects our long term non cancelable contractual obligations as of december  in millions contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt including current maturities operating leases total contractual cash obligations operating leases are primarily for office rent and trucks 
other than the amounts reflected above for these operating leases we have no cash commitments that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
as is common within the industry  we have entered into various operational commitments and agreements related to pipeline operations and to the marketing  transportation  terminalling and storage of crude oil 
it is management s belief that such commitments will be met without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we will distribute of our available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record  and to our general partner 
available cash is generally defined as all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the quarter less reserves established for future requirements 
minimum quarterly distributions are for each full fiscal quarter 
distributions of available cash to the holders of subordinated units are subject to the prior rights of the holders of common units to receive the minimum quarterly distributions for each quarter during the subordination period  and to receive any arrearages in the distribution of minimum quarterly distributions on the common units for prior quarters during the subordination period 
there were no arrearages on common units at december  on february   we paid a cash distribution of per unit on all outstanding units 
the total distribution paid was approximately million  with approximately million paid to our common unitholders  million paid to our subordinated unitholders and million paid to the general partner for its general partner and incentive distribution interests 
our general partner is entitled to incentive distributions if the amount we distribute with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in our partnership agreement 
under the quarterly incentive distribution provisions  our general partner is entitled to of amounts we distribute in excess of per common unit  of amounts we distribute in excess of per common unit and of amounts we distribute in excess of per common unit 
in connection with our crude oil marketing activities  we provide certain purchasers and transporters with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase of crude oil 
our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded in accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the crude oil is purchased 
generally  these letters of credit are issued for up to seventy day periods and are terminated upon completion of each transaction 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
such letters of credit are secured by our crude oil inventory and accounts receivable 
credit agreements in september we amended and expanded our credit facilities to include a six year  million term b loan 
in connection with this amendment  we reduced the revolving portion of the facilities by million 
our credit facilities currently consist of 
a million senior secured revolving credit and term loan facility  which is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the facility consists of i a million domestic revolving facility reflecting the million reduction in such facility in connection with the september amendment  with a million letter of credit sublimit  ii a million canadian revolving facility with a million letter of credit sublimit  iii a million term loan and iv a million term b loan 
the facility matures  i as to the aggregate million domestic and canadian revolver portions  in april  ii as to the million term portion  in may  and  iii as to the million term b loan portion  september on the revolver portions  no principal is scheduled for payment prior to maturity 
the million term loan portion of this facility has four scheduled annual payments of principal  commencing may   in the respective amounts of   and of the original term principal amount  with the remaining principal balance scheduled for payment on the stated maturity date of may  if any part of the term portion is prepaid prior to its first anniversary  a premium will be due on that portion 
the million term b loan has payable yearly commencing on september   with the remaining principal balance scheduled for payment on the stated maturity date of september  the term b loan may be prepaid without penalty 
the revolving credit and term loan facility bears interest at our option at either the base rate  as defined  plus an applicable margin  or libor plus an applicable margin  and further  the canadian revolver may effectively bear interest based upon bankers acceptance rates 
we incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolver portion of this credit facility 

a million senior secured letter of credit and borrowing facility  the purpose of which is to provide standby letters of credit to support the purchase and exchange of crude oil and other specified petroleum products for resale and borrowings to finance crude oil inventory and other specified petroleum products that have been hedged against future price risk 
the letter of credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a sublimit for cash borrowings of million to purchase crude oil and other petroleum products that have been hedged against future price risk and to fund margin requirements under nymex contracts used to facilitate our hedging activities 
the letter of credit facility expires in april  aggregate availability under the letter of credit facility for direct borrowings and letters of credit is limited to a borrowing base that is determined monthly based on certain of our current assets and current liabilities  primarily inventory and accounts receivable and accounts payable related to the purchase and sale of crude oil and other specified petroleum products 
we incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of this facility 
our credit facilities prohibit distributions on  or purchases or redemptions of  units if any default or event of default is continuing 
in addition  the agreements contain various covenants limiting our ability to  among other things 
incur indebtedness  
grant liens  
sell assets  
make investments  
engage in transactions with affiliates  
enter into certain contracts  and 
enter into a merger or consolidation 
our credit facilities treat a change of control as an event of default and also require us to maintain 
a current ratio as defined of to  
a debt coverage ratio which is not greater than to  
an interest coverage ratio which is not less than to  and 
a debt to capital ratio of not greater than to prior to december   and to thereafter 
a default under our credit facilities would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the outstanding debt and to foreclose on the assets securing the credit facilities 
as long as we are in compliance with our commercial credit agreements  they do not restrict our ability to make distributions of available cash as defined in our partnership agreement 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit agreements 
the credit facilities provide that the partnership may issue up to million of senior unsecured debt that has a maturity date extending beyond the maturity date of the credit facilities 
if senior unsecured debt is issued  the aggregate amount available under the million us revolving credit facility will be reduced by an amount equal to a of the face amount of the senior unsecured debt if the aggregate amount of new debt issued is less than million  or b of the face amount of the senior unsecured debt if the aggregate amount of new debt issued is equal to or greater than million  provided  however  in both cases  the amount of the revolver reduction is decreased by million 
in january  we amended our credit facility to provide the partnership with greater structuring flexibility to finance larger acquisitions by amending the limitation and restrictions on asset sales  including the removal of a provision that required lender approval before making any acquisition greater than million 
contingencies following our announcement in november of our losses resulting from unauthorized trading by a former employee  numerous class action lawsuits were filed against us  certain of our former general partner s officers and directors and in some of these cases  our former general partner and plains resources inc alleging violations of the federal securities laws 
in addition  derivative lawsuits were filed in the delaware chancery court against our former general partner  its directors and certain of its officers alleging the defendants breached the fiduciary duties owed to us and our unitholders by failing to monitor properly the activities of our traders 
we have settled or reached agreement in principle to settle all of these suits 
see item legal proceedings 
we may experience future releases of crude oil into the environment from our pipeline and storage operations  or discover releases that were previously unidentified 
although we maintain an extensive inspection program designed to prevent and  as applicable  to detect and address such releases promptly  damages and liabilities incurred due to any future environmental releases from our assets may substantially affect our business 
the events of september and their overall effect on the insurance industry may have a general adverse impact on availability and cost of coverage 
we currently maintain insurance for acts of terrorism on the majority of our assets and operations 
many of our current policies expire on june  due to the events of september   we believe that many insurers will exclude acts of terrorism from future insurance policies or make the cost for this coverage prohibitive 
since the september terrorist attacks  the united states government has issued warnings that energy assets including our nation s pipeline infrastructure may be a future target of terrorist organizations 
these developments expose our operations and assets to increased risks 
any future terrorist attacks on our facilities  those of our customers and  in some cases  those of our competitors  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
outlook as is common with most merchant activities  our ability to generate a profit on our margin activities is not tied to the absolute level of crude oil prices but is generated by the difference between the price paid and other costs incurred in the purchase of crude oil versus the price at which we sell crude oil 
the gross margin generated by tariff and other fee activities depends on the volumes transported on the pipeline and the level of the tariff or fee charged  as well as the fixed and variable costs of operating the pipeline 
these operations are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for crude oil 
our operations have been impacted by higher fuel and power costs relating to our pipeline and trucking operations 
the increased costs will be largely offset by an increase in the tariff rate on the all american pipeline effective january  also  the crude oil market moved from a backwardated to a flat and contango market during march of and remained that way during most of the remainder of a flat to contango crude oil market generally means lower gross margin from our gathering and marketing activities 
with countercyclical balance provided by our storage and terminalling assets  a contango market creates other arbitrage opportunities and an increase in the usage of our tankage in cushing and in the field 
during  this countercyclical balance served to offset a portion of the weaker gathering and marketing margins 
a continued prolonged flat crude oil market will continue to adversely affect our margins from gathering and marketing  while generally providing fewer arbitrage opportunities than exist in a contango market 
a significant portion of our gross margin is derived from pipeline transportation margins associated with the santa ynez and point arguello fields located offshore california 
while the rate of decline has reduced over the last three years  we expect that there will continue to be natural production declines from each of these fields as the underlying reservoirs are depleted 
in addition  any production disruption from these fields due to production problems  transportation problems or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business 
related party transactions we have a long term agreement with plains resources pursuant to which we purchase for resale at market prices all of plains resources equity crude oil production for a fee of per barrel 
in november  the agreement automatically extended for three years 
the fee is subject to adjustment every three years based on then existing market conditions 
for the year ended december   we paid approximately million for plains resources production and recognized gross margin of approximately million

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas business combinations and sfas 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  see note  to be accounted for under the purchase method 
for all business combinations for which the date of acquisition is after june   this standard also establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
we have adopted sfas effective january  sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after an acquisition 
the most significant changes made by sfas are goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period for intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas  amortization on the unamortized portion of the goodwill arising from previous acquisitions will cease in the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on either our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb also issued sfas  asset retirement obligations 
sfas establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  including the time of the liability recognition  initial measurement of the liability  allocation of asset retirement cost to expense  subsequent measurement of the liability and financial statement disclosures 
sfas requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
we will adopt the statement effective january   as required 
the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of sfas will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate the effect of the adoption of this statement on either our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in august  the fasb approved sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and provides additional implementation guidance for assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of other than by sale 
upon adoption of this statement effective january   there was no effect on either our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  which was subsequently amended i in june by sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which deferred the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after june   and ii in june by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedge activities  which amended certain provisions  inclusive of the definition of the normal purchase and sale exclusion 
we have determined that our physical purchase and sale agreements qualify for the normal purchase and sale exclusion 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if so  the type of hedge transaction 
for fair value hedge transactions in which we are hedging changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be offset in the income statement by changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
for cash flow hedge transactions  in which we are hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable rate asset  liability  or a forecasted transaction  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will be reported in other comprehensive income  a component of partners capital 
the gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in other comprehensive income will be reclassified as earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in earnings in the current period 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative cumulative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
we adopted sfas  as amended  effective january  our implementation procedures identified all instruments in place at the adoption date that are subject to the requirements of sfas upon adoption  we recorded a cumulative effect charge of million in accumulated other comprehensive income to recognize at fair value all derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments and a cumulative effect gain of million to earnings 
correspondingly  an asset of million and a liability of million were established 
hedge losses gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income are transferred to earnings as the forecasted transactions actually occur 
implementation issues continue to be addressed by the fasb and any change to existing guidance might impact our implementation 
adoption of this standard will most likely increase volatility in earnings and partners capital through comprehensive income 
risk factors related to our business our profitability is dependent upon an adequate supply of crude oil from fields located offshore and onshore california 
production from these offshore fields has experienced substantial production declines since a significant portion of our gross margin is derived from pipeline transportation margins associated with the santa ynez and point arguello fields located offshore california 
although the rate of decline from these fields has decreased over the last three years  we expect that there will continue to be natural production declines from each of these fields as the underlying reservoirs are depleted 
a  barrel per day decline in volumes shipped from these fields would result in a decrease in annual pipeline tariff revenues of approximately million 
see outlook 
in addition  any production disruption from these fields due to production problems  transportation problems or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business 
cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance and the establishment of financial reserves 
because distributions on the common units are dependent on the amount of cash we generate  distributions may fluctuate based on our performance 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay the minimum quarterly distributions of per common unit in each quarter 
the actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend upon numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control and the control of our general partner 
cash distributions are dependent primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
therefore  cash distributions might be made during periods when we record losses and might not be made during periods when we record profits 
potential future acquisitions and expansions  if any  may affect our business by substantially increasing the level of our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and increasing our risks of being unable to effectively integrate these new operations 
from time to time  we evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and businesses 
acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness 
if we consummate any future acquisitions  our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources 
in  we suffered a large loss from unauthorized crude oil trading by a former employee 
a loss of this kind could occur again in the future in spite of our efforts to prevent it 
generally  it is our policy that as we purchase crude oil  we establish a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies  or by entering into a future delivery obligation under futures contracts on the nymex 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases  on the one hand  and sales or future delivery obligations  on the other hand 
except for pre defined inventory positions described in items and business and properties terminalling  storage  gathering and marketing operations crude oil volatility  counter cyclical balance  risk management  our policy is not to acquire and hold crude oil  futures contracts or derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes 
we discovered in november that this policy was violated by one of our former employees  which resulted in losses of approximately million  including estimated associated costs and legal expenses 
in  we recognized an additional million charge for litigation related to the unauthorized trading losses 
we have taken steps within our organization to enhance our processes and procedures to prevent future unauthorized trading 
we cannot assure you  however  that these steps will detect and prevent all violations of our trading policies and procedures  particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved 
see items and business and properties unauthorized trading loss 
we have substantial leverage that may limit our ability to borrow additional funds  make distributions to unitholders  comply with the terms of our indebtedness or capitalize on business opportunities 
our leverage is significant in relation to our partners capital 
as of december   our total outstanding long term debt was approximately million 
our payment of principal and interest on the debt will reduce the cash available for distribution on the units 
we will be prohibited from making cash distributions during an event of default under any of our indebtedness 
various limitations in our credit facilities may reduce our ability to incur additional debt  to engage in some transactions and to capitalize on business opportunities 
any subsequent refinancing of our current indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the success of our business strategy to increase and optimize throughput on our pipeline and gathering assets is dependent upon our securing additional supplies of crude oil 
our operating results are dependent upon securing additional supplies of crude oil from increased production by oil companies and aggressive lease gathering efforts 
the ability of producers to increase production is dependent on the prevailing market price of oil  the exploration and production budgets of the major and independent oil companies  the depletion rate of existing reservoirs  the success of new wells drilled  environmental concerns  regulatory initiatives and other matters beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that production of crude oil will rise to sufficient levels to cause an increase in the throughput on our pipeline and gathering assets 
our operations are dependent upon demand for crude oil by refiners in the midwest and on the gulf coast 
any decrease in this demand could adversely affect our business 
demand also depends on the ability and willingness of shippers having access to our transportation assets to satisfy their demand by deliveries through those assets  and any decrease in this demand could adversely affect our business 
demand for crude oil is dependent upon the impact of future economic conditions  fuel conservation measures  alternative fuel requirements  governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices  all of which could reduce demand 
we face intense competition in our terminalling and storage activities and gathering and marketing activities 
our competitors include other crude oil pipelines  the major integrated oil companies  their marketing affiliates and independent gatherers  brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes  financial resources and experience 
some of these competitors have capital resources many times greater than ours and control substantially greater supplies of crude oil 
see items and business and properties competition 
the profitability of our gathering and marketing activities depends primarily on the volumes of crude oil we purchase and gather 
to maintain the volumes of crude oil we purchase  we must continue to contract for new supplies of crude oil to offset volumes lost because of natural declines in crude oil production from depleting wells or volumes lost to competitors 
replacement of lost volumes of crude oil is particularly difficult in an environment where production is low and competition to gather available production is intense 
generally  because producers experience inconveniences in switching crude oil purchasers  such as delays in receipt of proceeds while awaiting the preparation of new division orders  producers typically do not change purchasers on the basis of minor variations in price 
thus  we may experience difficulty acquiring crude oil at the wellhead in areas where there are existing relationships between producers and other gatherers and purchasers of crude oil 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our gathering and marketing activities 
in those cases where we provide division order services for crude oil purchased at the wellhead  we may be responsible for distribution of proceeds to all parties 
in other cases  we pay all of or a portion of the production proceeds to an operator who distributes these proceeds to the various interest owners 
these arrangements expose us to operator credit risk  and there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses in dealings with other parties 
our operations are subject to federal and state environmental and safety laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and operational safety 
our pipeline  gathering  storage and terminalling facilities operations are subject to the risk of incurring substantial environmental and safety related costs and liabilities 
these costs and liabilities could arise under increasingly strict environmental and safety laws  including regulations and enforcement policies  or claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations 
if we were not able to recover such resulting costs through insurance or increased tariffs and revenues  cash distributions to unitholders could be adversely affected 
the transportation and storage of crude oil results in a risk that crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be suddenly or gradually released into the environment  potentially causing substantial expenditures for a response action  significant government penalties  liability for natural resources damages to government agencies  personal injury or property damage to private parties and significant business interruption 
see items and business and properties regulation 
our pipeline systems are dependent upon their interconnections with other crude oil pipelines to reach end markets 
reduced throughput on these interconnecting pipelines as a result of testing  line repair  reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in reduced throughput on our pipeline systems that would adversely affect our profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to various market risks  including volatility in crude oil commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage such exposure  we monitor our inventory levels  current economic conditions and our expectations of future commodity prices and interest rates when making decisions with respect to risk management 
except for inventory transactions that generally do not exceed approximately  barrels  we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative trading purposes 
see items and business and properties crude volatility  counter cyclical balance  risk management 
substantially all of our derivative contracts are exchanged or traded on the nymex or entered into with major financial institutions and the risk of credit loss is considered remote 
commodity price risk 
the fair value of outstanding derivative instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a percent price decrease are shown in the table below in millions year of maturity effect of effect of fair price fair price value decrease value decrease crude oil futures contracts swaps and options contracts the fair values of the futures contracts are based on quoted market prices obtained from the nymex 
the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from independent reporting services compared to the contract price of the swap  which comparison approximates the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at year end 
all hedge positions offset physical positions exposed to the cash market  none of these offsetting physical positions are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board percent decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual percent change in prompt month crude prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
at december   our hedging activities included crude oil futures contracts maturing through  covering approximately million barrels of product 
because such contracts are designated as hedges and correlate to price movements of crude oil  any gains or losses resulting from market changes will be largely offset by losses or gains on our hedged inventory or anticipated purchases of crude oil 
such contracts resulted in an increase in revenues of million in and a reduction in revenues of million in and of million in the offsetting gains from the physical positions are not included in such amounts 
the unrealized loss with respect to such instruments  interest rate hedges and foreign exchange hedges  at december   was million 
interest rate risk 
our debt instruments are sensitive to market fluctuations in interest rates 
the table below presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt outstanding at december  our variable rate debt bears interest at libor or prime plus the applicable margin

interest rate swaps and collars are used to hedge underlying interest payment obligations 
these instruments hedge interest rates on specific debt issuances and qualify for hedge accounting 
the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the instruments 
at december   we had interest rate swap and collar arrangements for an aggregate notional principal amount of million  for which we would pay approximately million if such arrangements were terminated as of such date

our cash flow stream relating to our canadian operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in canadian dollars 
assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenues  expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
since substantially all of our canadian business is conducted in canadian dollars  we use certain financial instruments to minimize the risks of changes in the exchange rate 
these instruments include forward exchange contracts  forward extra option contracts and cross currency swaps 
additionally  at december   million million canadian of our long term debt was denominated in canadian dollars 
all of the financial instruments utilized are placed with large creditworthy financial institutions that participate in our credit facilities and meet the criteria under sfas for hedge accounting treatment 
at december   we had forward exchange contracts and forward extra option contracts that allow us to exchange million canadian for at least million us based on a us dollar exchange rate of quarterly during and if these contracts were terminated on december   we would receive million us at december   we also had a cross currency swap contract for an aggregate notional principal amount of million  effectively converting this amount of our million senior secured term loan of the total from us dollars to million of canadian dollar debt based on a canadian us dollar exchange rate of
