our products are currently licensed by  companies worldwide in diverse industries such as telecommunications  retail  healthcare  manufacturing  energy  transportation  logistics  financial services and insurance 
we sell our products through a direct sales force and through oem and reselling agreements with leading software vendors and systems integrators 
our revenue in fiscal  and consisted primarily of license and maintenance fees from our customers and distributors  including from reuters pursuant to our license agreement with it  both of which were primarily attributable to sales of our tibco activeenterprise product suite 
in addition  we receive fees from our customers for providing project integration services 
we also receive revenues from our strategic relationships with business partners who embed our products in their hardware and networking systems as well as from systems integrators who resell our products 
we recognize license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by statement of position revenue from subscription license agreements  which include software  rights to future products and maintenance  is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period

first year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
maintenance revenue is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months 
consulting and training revenues are recognized as the services are performed and are usually on a time and materials basis 
such services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation of the company s products and generally do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
reuters is a distributor of our products to customers in the financial services segment 
we have a license  maintenance  and distribution agreement with reuters  a major stockholder  which was amended in june under the amended agreement  reuters agreed to continue its obligation to pay a minimum guaranteed distribution fee to us in the amount of million per year through december for the years ended december    and the nine months ended december   reuters guaranteed minimum distribution fees were million  million  and million  respectively 
these fees are recognized ratably over the corresponding period as related party revenue 
if actual distribution fees due from reuters exceed the cumulative minimum year to date guarantee  incremental fees are due 
such incremental fees are recognized in the period when the year to date fees exceed the cumulative minimum level 
in fiscal   and  revenue from reuters was million  million  and million  respectively  which accounted for   and of our total revenue  respectively 
the amended agreement also revises the terms under which we may sell to customers in the financial services segment 
royalty payments to reuters for resale of reuters products and services or fees associated with sales to the financial services segment are classified as related party cost of sales 
in addition  the amended agreement also requires us to provide reuters with internal maintenance and support until december  for a fee of million for the calendar year and million per year thereafter 
reuters may choose at its option to discontinue such internal maintenance and support after and pay no additional fees 
this amount is recognized ratably over the corresponding period as related party maintenance revenue 
our revenue is derived from a diverse customer base and no single customer represented greater than of total revenue during fiscal years   and  respectively  with the exception of reuters 
one customer had a balance in excess of of net accounts receivable at november  and two customers had balances greater than of net accounts receivable at november  we establish allowances for doubtful accounts based on our evaluation of collectibility and an allowance for returns and discounts based on specifically identified credits and historical experience

in fiscal  and  revenue from reuters was million  million  and million respectively  consisting primarily of product fees on its sales of our products under our license agreement with reuters 
license revenue license revenue was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
license revenue increased million  or  from to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the increased volume of sales to both new and existing customers 
license revenue increased million  or  from to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the increased volume of sales from a broader suite of products 
license revenue was  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in license revenue as a percentage of total revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to slowing sales growth in a weakening global economy along with the increase in service and maintenance revenue 
the increase in license revenue as a percentage of total revenue from fiscal to fiscal reflected our strategy of pursuing a license driven business model  the increasing acceptance of our products in key vertical markets and the expansion of our relationships with systems integrators which effectively leverages our direct sales of software products 
we expect that license revenues will grow in absolute dollars and will remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal service and maintenance revenue service and maintenance revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and million  or  from fiscal to fiscal service and maintenance revenue was  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
these increases were primarily a result of additional maintenance revenue related to the growth in license revenue and renewals related to the growing installed customer base 
we expect that service and maintenance revenue revenues will grow in absolute dollars and will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries  third party contractor and associated expenses related to providing project implementation services  the cost of providing maintenance and customer support services  royalties and product fees 
the majority of our cost of revenue is directly related to our service revenue 
cost of revenue  excluding stock based compensation charges  was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and million  or  from fiscal to fiscal cost of revenue was  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in cost of revenue in absolute dollars in fiscal and resulted from increased service and maintenance revenue 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  third party contractors and related costs associated with the development of our tibco activeenterprise  tibco activeexchange  and tibco activeportal product suites 
research and development expenses  excluding stock based compensation charges  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and million  or  from fiscal to fiscal these increases were due primarily to increases in our development staff and third party development agreements that we entered into during fiscal as we continued to expand the product suites and upgrade the performance of existing products 
research and development expenses were  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as a result  expect that spending on research and development will continue to increase in absolute dollars while declining slightly as a percentage of revenue in fiscal sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs of our direct sales force and marketing staff and the cost of marketing programs  including customer conferences  promotional materials  trade shows and advertising 
sales and marketing expenses  excluding stock based compensation charges  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and million  or  from fiscal to fiscal these increases resulted primarily from the continued expansion of our domestic and international direct sales force in order to sell our expanding suite of products 
sales and marketing expenses were  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we intend to continue to increase staff in our direct sales organization and to develop product marketing programs and  accordingly  expect that sales and marketing expenditures will continue to increase in absolute dollars while remaining relatively constant as a percentage of revenue for fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive  legal  finance  accounting and human resources 
general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation charges  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and million  or  from fiscal to fiscal these increases were primarily a result of increased staffing and associated operational costs related to building our general and administrative infrastructure 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively stable as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and non employee directors during fiscal and  we recorded aggregate unearned compensation of million  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and the exercise price of such options 
in addition  we recorded aggregate unearned compensation of million in connection with the acquisition of extensibility inc extensibility related to unvested options that were assumed as well as stock that was issued as part of the consideration for the acquisition  which is being held in an escrow account 
such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable option or as the stock is released from escrow and is shown by expense category 
we expect to amortize million  million and million of unearned stock based compensation in fiscal   and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense related to employees  non employee directors and extensibility was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to consultants is recognized as earned using the multiple option method as prescribed by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 and is shown by expense category 
at each reporting date  we re value the stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model 
as a result  the stock based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates 
in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants  we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of november   we expect to amortize stock based compensation expense related to consultants of million in fiscal  assuming no change in the underlying value of our common stock 
in fiscal and  we recognized million and million  respectively  as stock compensation expense related to the employer portion of payroll taxes due as a result of employee exercise of nonqualified stock options 
acquired in process research and development management estimated that million of the purchase price of extensibility in fiscal and million of the purchase price of inconcert  inc inconcert in fiscal represented acquired in process research and development iprd that did not meet the requirements for capitalization 
accordingly  these amounts were immediately charged to expense upon consummation of the acquisitions 
the value of iprd was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion 
the projects have subsequently been completed 
amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles of million recorded in connection with the acquisition of extensibility in august are being amortized over their useful lives of two to five years 
during the fourth quarter of  million of goodwill and other acquired intangibles were recorded in connection with the asset purchase of inconcert and are being amortized over their estimated useful life of years 
restructuring charge during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million  consisting of million for headcount reductions  million for consolidation of facilities  and million of other related restructuring charges 
in response to slower sales growth in a weakening global economy  these restructuring charges were taken to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
the plan resulted in headcount reduction of approximately employees  which was made up of sales and marketing staff  professional services staff  general and administrative staff and research and development staff 
the plan also included the consolidation of facilities through closing excess field offices and moving corporate offices into one campus 
cash utilized during the fiscal year ended november  included million for severance and other costs related to headcount reductions and million for facilities and other restructuring costs 
the provision of million at november  is for facility charges which are expected to be paid over the next six years 
interest income  net  other expense  net and realized loss on investments interest income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the increase was due primarily to an increase in average balances resulting from positive cash flow from operating activities and the investment balances from the our follow on offering being held for the entire year 
the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income due to higher average cash and investment balances following the successful completion of our follow on offering in march other expense  net includes translation adjustments and other miscellaneous expense items 
other expense  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
realized loss on investments  net was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
income taxes in fiscal and  respectively  a million benefit and million provision was recorded for federal  state  and foreign taxes 
no provision was recorded for fiscal as of november   our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were million and million  respectively  which expire through as of november   our federal and state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were million and million  respectively  which expire through since our incorporation  we had provided a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
at november   we removed the valuation allowance because we expect that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future 
in the event of a change in ownership  as defined under federal and state tax laws  our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources in march  we completed a follow on offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
net proceeds to us aggregated approximately million  net of underwriters commissions and issuance costs of million 
in july  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
net proceeds to us aggregated approximately million  net of underwriters commissions and offering expenses of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million resulting from positive cash flows as our net loss of million was more than offset by non cash charges of million and by a net reduction of million in working capital principally due to a reduction in trade receivables 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million as our net loss of million was offset by non cash charges of million 
net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was million  resulting primarily from our net losses 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal and was related primarily to the purchase of short term investments 
net cash used for investing activities for fiscal related primarily to the purchase of short term investments and to the acquisition of inconcert  inc net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal  and  respectively  was million  million and million 
we raised million in a follow on offering in fiscal and million in an initial public offering in fiscal at november  and  we had million and million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  respectively 
we anticipate continued growth in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future  particularly in sales and marketing expenses and  to a lesser extent  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
as a result  we expect to use our cash resources to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures  including the construction of our campus and additions to our it infrastructure  and additionally  to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve to eighteen months 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   we are required to adopt sfas no 
effective december  amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired before july  was million in fiscal in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
on december  and does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
factors that may affect operating results the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in forward looking statements related to our business 
we have a history of losses and we expect future losses  and if we do not achieve and sustain profitability our business will suffer and our stock price may decline 
we may not be able to sustain our growth or obtain sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability 
we incurred net losses of approximately million  million  and million in fiscal   and respectively 
as of november   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have invested significantly in building our sales and marketing organization and in our technology research and development 
we expect to continue to spend financial and other resources on developing and introducing enhancements to our existing and new software products and our direct sales and marketing activities 
as a result  we need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
our future revenue is unpredictable  and we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate  which may cause our stock price to decline 
period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
moreover  our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in that event  our stock price would likely decline 
as a result of our limited operating history  our business strategy and the evolving nature of the markets in which we compete  we may have difficulty accurately forecasting our revenue in any given period 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this section  a number of factors may cause our revenue to fall short of our expectations or cause fluctuations in our operating results  including 
the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products or services by our competitors  
the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our operations  and 
the capital and expense budgeting decisions of our customers 
in addition  our quarterly operating results are subject to variations throughout the year due to seasonal factors  which generally result in lower sales activity in our first and third fiscal quarters 
there can be no assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase our products in the future 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
there can be no assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase our products in the future 
as a result  a customer that generates substantial revenue for us in one period may not be a source of revenue in subsequent periods 
one customer accounted for and of our total revenue in the second and third quarters of fiscal  respectively 
our licensing and distribution relationship with reuters places limitations on our ability to conduct our business 
we have a significant relationship with reuters for licensing and distribution 
our relationship with reuters involves limitations and restrictions on our business  as well as other risks  described below 
reuters has access to the intellectual property used in our products  and could use the intellectual property to compete with us 
we license from reuters the underlying tib messaging technology  that existed as of december  which is incorporated into some of our important tibco activeenterprise products 
we do not own this technology 
reuters is not restricted from using the tib technology to produce products that compete with our products  and it can grant limited licenses to the tib technology to others who may compete with us 
in addition  we must license all the intellectual property and products we create through december to reuters 
this will place reuters in a position to more easily develop products that compete with our product offerings 
we must rely on reuters and other distributors to sell our products in the financial services market  and they may not be successful in doing so 
under our agreements with reuters  we are restricted from selling our products and providing consulting services directly to companies in the financial services market and major competitors of reuters  and from using the tib technology we license from reuters to develop products specifically for use by these companies 
accordingly  we must rely on reuters and other third party resellers and distributors to sell our products to these companies 
a significant portion of our revenue from sales in the financial services market consists of product fees paid to us by reuters 
although reuters is a distributor of our products in the financial services market and is required to pay us guaranteed minimum product fee payments until the end of  reuters has no contractual obligation to distribute our products to financial services customers 
reuters and other distributors may not be successful in selling our products into the financial services market  or they may elect to sell competitive third party products into that market  either of which may adversely affect our revenue in that market 
in addition  when we sell to customers in the financial services market  we must pay a fee to reuters 
our relationship with reuters restricts our ability to earn revenue from sales in the financial services market 
under the license agreement  reuters is required to pay us product fees based on a percentage of its revenue from sales of our products in the financial services market  excluding products that are embedded in any reuters products 
these product fees may be materially less than the product fees we could obtain from other distributors or resellers in the financial services market 
in addition  when we sell our products into the financial services market through third party distributors other than reuters  reuters receives a share of our license revenue 
our license agreement with reuters imposes practical restrictions on our ability to acquire other companies 
the license agreement places no specific restrictions on our ability to acquire companies with all or part of their business in the financial services market 
however  under the terms of the license agreement  we are prohibited from bundling or combining our products that are based on licensed technology with an acquired company s products and services and then selling the bundled or combined products directly to financial services companies 
this prohibition could prevent us from realizing potential synergies with companies we acquire 
the market for infrastructure software may not grow as quickly as we anticipate  which would cause our revenues to fall below expectations 
the market for infrastructure software is relatively new and evolving 
we earn a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our infrastructure software  including application integration software  and related services 
we expect to earn substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future from sales of these products and services 
our future financial performance will depend on continued growth in the number of organizations demanding software and services for application integration  information delivery and seeking outside vendors to develop  manage and maintain this software for their critical applications 
many of our potential customers have made significant investments in internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to third party products  which may substantially inhibit the growth of the market for infrastructure software 
if the market fails to grow  or grows more slowly than we expect  our sales will be adversely affected 
in addition  a weakening global economy may lead to slower sales growth 
our acquisition strategy could cause financial or operational problems 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands  and competitive pressures 
to this end  we may acquire new and complementary businesses  products or technologies 
we do not know if we will be able to complete any acquisitions or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate them profitably  or retain their key employees 
integrating any newly acquired business  product or technology could be expensive and time consuming  could disrupt our ongoing business  and could distract our management 
we may face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources 
in addition in order to finance any acquisitions  we might need to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
in that event  we could be forced to obtain equity or debt financing on terms that are not favorable to us and  in the case of equity financing  that results in dilution to our stockholders 
if we are unable to integrate any newly acquired entity  products or technology effectively  our business  financial condition and operating results would suffer 
in addition  any amortization of goodwill and intangible assets or other charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our operating results 
our investment strategy could cause financial or operational problems 
through november   we had invested million in companies with complementary technologies or products or which provide us with access to additional vertical markets and customers  and we plan to continue making such investments in the future 
the companies in which we invest are often at early stages of development  and no public market exists for their securities at the time of our investment 
these investments may not result in any meaningful commercial benefit to us  and our investments could lose all or a significant part of their value 
moreover  in certain circumstances  these investments could subject us to restrictions imposed by the investment company act of we might have to take actions  including buying  refraining from buying  selling or refraining from selling securities when we would otherwise not wish to  in order to avoid registration under the investment company act of our stock price may be volatile  which could cause investors to lose all or part of their investments in our stock 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology companies in particular  have recently experienced volatility which has often been unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company or companies 
during fiscal  for example  our stock price fluctuated between a high of and a low of 
if market or industry based fluctuation continue  our stock price could decline in the future regardless of our actual operating performance and investors could lose all or part of their investments 
the rapid growth of our operations could strain our resources and cause our business to suffer 
our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we have increased the scope of our operations and we have increased our headcount substantially  both domestically and internationally 
we must successfully integrate these new employees into our operations and generate sufficient revenues to justify the costs associated with these employees 
if we fail to successfully integrate employees or to generate the revenue necessary to offset employee related expenses  we could be forced to reduce our headcount  which would force us to incur significant expenses and would harm our business and operating results 
for example  in response to changing market conditions  in fiscal we recorded a restructuring charge of million  including million related to a reduction of our headcount by approximately employees 
our growth has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems  infrastructure and resources 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures 
we will also need to continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide 
furthermore  we expect that we will be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties 
failure to expand any of the foregoing areas efficiently and effectively could interfere with the growth of our business as a whole 
pending litigation could harm our business 
between july  and december   several purported class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us  several of our current and former officers and directors and the underwriters of our july initial public offering and march follow on offering 
the complaints generally allege that the named defendants violated federal securities laws because the prospectuses related to the offerings failed to disclose  and contained false and misleading statements regarding  certain commissions purported to have been received by the underwriters  and other underwriter practices  in connection with their allocation of shares in our offerings 
we believe that the claims against us and our current and former officers and directors are without merit and we intend to defend against the complaints vigorously 
the complaints do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek  and as a result  we are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred as a result of the lawsuits 
we have not accrued any amounts relating to potential damages associated with the lawsuits 
the uncertainty associated with a substantial unresolved lawsuit could harm our business  financial condition and reputation 
the defense of the lawsuits could result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
negative developments with respect to the lawsuits could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolutions of the lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  such a payment could seriously harm our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
the maximum allowable duration of a single issue is years and the maximum allowable duration of the portfolio is years 
at the end of fiscal  and  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities totaling million  million and million  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds  respectively 
our investments consist primarily of bank and finance notes  various government obligations and asset backed securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
unrealized losses are charged against income when a decline in fair market value is determined to be other than temporary 
the specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold 
the investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value in the event market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points approximately of current rates in the portfolio from levels as of november   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
we develop products in the united states and sell in north america  europe and the pacific rim 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a majority of sales are currently made in us dollars  however  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to manage exposure related to accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately million  million and million at november   and  respectively 
the open contracts at november  mature at various dates through february and are economic hedges of certain foreign currency transaction exposures in the australian dollar  british pound  swedish krona  euro  japanese yen  and danish krone 
the fair value of these forward contracts at november  was not significant
