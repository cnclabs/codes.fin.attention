item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are the largest direct marketing company for supplemental educational supplies to schools and teachers for prek in the united states 
we offer more than  items through an innovative two pronged marketing approach that targets both school administrators and individual teachers 
our broad product range enables us to provide our customers with one source for virtually all of their non textbook school supplies and furniture needs 
we have grown significantly in recent years primarily through acquisitions but also through internal growth 
for information on our recent acquisitions see the business combinations note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our revenues for fiscal were million and our operating income was million  which represented compound annual revenue growth of and compounded annual operating income growth  prior to restructuring charges of  compared to our fiscal results 
our gross margin has improved in recent years primarily due to acquisitions and increased buying power 
we have acquired many specialty businesses  which tend to have higher gross margins than our traditional business 
in addition  our acquisitions of both specialty and traditional businesses have increased our buying power  resulting in reduced costs of the products we purchase 
our operating profit and margins also improved significantly over the last several years 
this improvement reflects our acquisitions of specialty companies  which typically have higher operating margins than our traditional business 
in addition  through the integration of acquired businesses  we have been able to further improve our operating profit and margins by eliminating redundant expenses  leveraging overhead costs and improving purchasing power 
in recent years  we have grown through acquisitions 
as a result of integrating the acquired operations  we have recorded restructuring charges over the last several years 
these charges have primarily been to close existing facilities and to consolidate operations that  when combined with acquired operations  became redundant 
to the extent our integrations have resulted in certain exit costs such as the closure of acquired facilities  the costs were accrued in purchase accounting 
our business and working capital needs are highly seasonal with peak sales levels occurring from june through october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of our orders so that schools and teachers receive their merchandise by the start of each school year 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between may and october and the majority of cash receipts are collected from september through december 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
our fiscal financial statements have been restated

the following md a gives affect to the restatement 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain information as a percentage of revenues on a historical basis concerning our results of operations for the fiscal years   and fiscal year revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring costs operating income interest expense  net other expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income consolidated historical results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal traditional segment revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in traditional segment revenues was primarily due to acquisitions 
specialty segment revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in specialty segment revenues was due to internal growth and acquisitions  partially offset by the exclusion of revenues from the three businesses disposed of since january gross profit gross profit increased from million  or of revenues in fiscal to million  or of revenues in fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to an increase in revenues and gross margin 
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to strong improvement in the traditional segment from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal this increase in gross margin in the traditional segment was primarily due to strong improvement in the consumable business  driven by improved purchasing power and modest selling price increases 
specialty segment gross margin improved to of revenues in fiscal from of revenues in fiscal this improvement was primarily driven by the classroomdirect business  which improved gross margin primarily through an increase in selling price and the childcraft business  which improved gross margin primarily through improved operating efficiencies and purchasing power 
on a consolidated basis  gross margin was impacted by an increase in traditional segment revenue mix driven by the november acquisition of jl hammett s k wholesale business from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal the traditional segment historically has lower gross margins than the specialty segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include selling expenses the most significant component of which is sales wages and commissions  operations expenses which includes customer service  warehouse and warehouse shipments transportation costs  catalog costs  general administrative overhead which includes information systems  accounting  legal  and human resources and depreciation and amortization expense 
sg a increased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal traditional segment sg a increased million from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal increase in sg a was primarily due to an increase in variable costs related to increased revenues and an increase in fixed operating costs  primarily due to redundancies created with the hammett acquisition 
specialty segment sg a increased million from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal increase in specialty segment sg a was primarily due to the acquisition of premier agendas  and costs to consolidate existing operations into acquired businesses 
these traditional and specialty segment increases were partially offset by our early adoption at the beginning of fiscal of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets  which resulted in the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill 
corporate expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages  salary continuation obligations related to the death of our chief executive officer and depreciation 
the decrease in traditional segment sg a as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal the increase in specialty segment sg a as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to operating costs of premier agendas  a highly seasonal business acquired during a seasonally low period  costs associated with closing our distribution center in birmingham  alabama  costs associated with integrating our hammond stephens sales force with the premier agendas sales force and increased catalog costs primarily due to the inclusion of a full fiscal year of catalog expense for teacher s video  which has higher catalog costs as a percentage of revenues than our other specialty businesses 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in amortization expense  due to our adoption of sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal interest expense net interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in debt outstanding partially offset by a reduction in our effective borrowing rate on our credit facility 
other expenses other expense increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal other expenses in fiscal primarily consisted of the discount and loss on the accounts receivable securitization of million  million to write off a long term investment and a million realized loss on the sale of available for sale securities 
other expense in fiscal primarily consisted of the discount and loss on an accounts receivable securitization the receivable securitization of million 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for fiscal increased or million over fiscal  reflecting effective tax rates of and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate of in fiscal as compared to in fiscal was due primarily to the impact of our adoption of sfas no 
 and its impact on non deductible goodwill amortization 
the higher effective tax rate  compared to the federal statutory rate of  was primarily due to state and local income taxes 
fiscal weeks compared to fiscal weeks revenues revenues increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal traditional segment revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal specialty segment revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal increase in revenues was primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from the eight businesses acquired since the beginning of fiscal and internal growth on existing business 
these increases were partially offset by an extra week of shipments in fiscal  as fiscal was a week fiscal year and fiscal had weeks 
on a comparable week basis  revenues increased from fiscal to fiscal gross profit gross profit increased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal traditional segment gross profit increased million from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal the increase in traditional segment gross profit was primarily due to an increase in revenues 
the change in traditional segment gross margin was primarily due to slightly lower gross margin on the furniture lines  partially offset by enhanced consumable business gross margins and an increase in consumable business product mix  which has higher gross margins than the furniture lines 
specialty segment gross profit increased million from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal increase in specialty segment gross profit was primarily due to an increase in revenues and an increase in gross margin in the childcraft division driven by improved operating efficiencies and purchasing power and the acquisition of global video in june  which has higher gross margins than most of our other specialty businesses 
these increases were offset by lower gross margins in the classroomdirect division  driven by internet pricing strategies 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal traditional segment sg a increased million  or  from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues in fiscal the increase in traditional segment sg a was primarily due to an increase in variable costs related to increased revenues and the acquisition of certain assets of hammett 
the change in traditional segment sg a as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the acquisition of hammett during our seasonally low period  which created redundancies in the traditional segment 
we began to integrate hammett during the third quarter of fiscal  and further consolidated operations as a result of the acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal  following our heavy shipping season 
specialty segment sg a increased million or from million  or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal the increase in specialty segment sg a and sg a as a percent of revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenues and expenses incurred to develop our internet operations and the acquisition of global video in june  a business which generally has higher sg a expense due to catalog costs than our other specialty businesses 
restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million  which includes million to close redundant facilities  million for severance and termination benefits for approximately individuals and million for other costs 
further details of the restructuring charge are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense net interest expense increased million from million  or of revenues  in fiscal  to million  or of revenues in fiscal increase in net interest expense was primarily attributable to the debt assumed and cash paid for the acquisitions of global video and hammett  which occurred in june and november  respectively  and a slight increase in the effective interest rate 
these increases were partially offset by reduced interest expense attributable to debt repaid from the net proceeds from the sale of property of million  the sale of gresswell of million and proceeds from the receivable securitization of million  which we entered into in november other expenses other expenses decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal other expenses in fiscal primarily consisted of the discount and loss on the receivable securitization of million 
other expenses in fiscal primarily consisted of a million non cash impairment charge on a minority equity investment 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for fiscal decreased or million over fiscal  reflecting income tax rates of and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the difference in book and tax basis related to the divestitures of smartstuff and gresswell 
the higher effective tax rate  as compared to the federal statutory rate of  was primarily due to state and local income taxes and non deductible goodwill amortization 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had working capital of million 
our capitalization at april  was million and consisted of total debt of million and shareholders equity of million 
we currently have a five year secured million credit facility with bank of america  na the credit facility had an initial million term loan maturing quarterly and million of availability under revolving loans 
the credit facility matures on september  the amount outstanding as of april  under the revolving portion of the credit facility was million 
during fiscal  the term loan portion of the credit facility was repaid in full 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains certain financial and other covenants 
borrowings under the credit facility are usually significantly higher during the first two quarters of our fiscal year to meet the working capital needs of our peak selling season 
on july   we sold an aggregate principal amount of million of six percent convertible subordinated notes due august  the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share and accrue interest payable semi annually 
net proceeds from the sale of these notes was approximately million 
on august   the purchasers of the notes exercised their over allotment option in full and purchased an additional million 
we used the total net proceeds from the offering of million to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under the credit facility 
effective january   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the bank of new york covering million of the outstanding amount under the revolving portion of our credit facility 
the one year non cancelable swap agreement fixed the day libor interest rate at per annum on a million notional amount 
the swap expired january  as of april   our effective interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility was  which includes amortization of the loan origination fee and costs and the commitment fee on unborrowed funds 
during fiscal  we borrowed under our credit facility primarily for seasonal working capital  acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
during the same period  we made certain changes to certain financial and other covenants under our credit facility 
in november  we entered into a receivable securitization with a financial institution whereby we sell on a continuous basis an undivided interest in all of our eligible trade accounts receivable 
under the receivable securitization  we transfer without recourse all of our accounts receivable to a wholly owned subsidiary 
this subsidiary  in turn  has sold and  subject to certain conditions  may from time to time sell an undivided interest in these receivables and is permitted to receive advances of up to million for the sale of such undivided interest 
the facility expired in november and was renewed to extend to november and may be extended further with the financial institution s consent 
at april   million was advanced under the receivable securitization and accordingly  that amount of accounts receivable has been removed from our consolidated balance sheet 
the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce borrowings on our credit facility 
costs associated with the sale of receivables  primarily related to the discount and loss on sale  were million during fiscal and are included in other expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
in may  the receivable securitization was amended to allow advances up to million 
in november  we entered into two sale leaseback transactions which are accounted for as financings 
under the agreements  we recorded million of debt  which has an effective interest rate of  excluding amortization of related fees 
the leases expire in november during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million  an increase over fiscal the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to an improvement in working capital management and an increase in net income 
net cash used in investing activities was million  including million for acquisitions and million for additions to property  plant and equipment 
we realized million in net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities 
cash from financing activities was million 
net proceeds from our convertible debt offering of million were used to reduce borrowing under our credit facility 
borrowing under our credit facility and cash from operations were used to fund the above investing activities 
during fiscal  debt outstanding under our credit facility was reduced by million 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million  a increase over fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million  including million for acquisitions and million for additions to property and equipment 
this use of cash was partially offset by net proceeds provided by the sale of property of million and the sale of gresswell of million 
net borrowings combined with cash from operations  cash on hand and proceeds from the receivables securitization of million were used to finance the above investing activities 
our capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to be approximately million 
the largest items include computer hardware and software 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations  borrowings available from our existing credit facility and other sources of capital will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for operations  including capital expenditures  and our contractual obligations 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual debt and operating lease obligations as of april  payments due by fiscal year in thousands thereafter total debt     operating leases        total contractual obligations        fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our business is subject to seasonal influences 
our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our fiscal year  primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in our costs for the products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies we acquire may differ substantially from our own  which could contribute to further fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for fiscal years and we derived this quarterly data from unaudited consolidated financial statements 
certain fiscal and fiscal financial data has been restated 
see restatement of financial statements note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal first second third fourth total as restated as restated as restated as restated revenues      gross profit      operating income loss      net income loss      per share amounts basic diluted fiscal first second third fourth total as restated as restated as restated revenues      gross profit      operating income loss      net income loss      per share amounts basic diluted inflation inflation has and is expected to have only a minor effect on our results of operations and our internal and external sources of liquidity 
critical accounting policies we believe the policies identified below are critical to our business and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business are discussed throughout md a where applicable 
refer to our notes to consolidated financial statements in item for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect a the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and b the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and base them on a combination of historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows catalog costs and related amortization we accumulate all direct costs incurred in the development  production and circulation of our catalogs on our balance sheet until such time as the related catalog is mailed  at which time  they are subsequently amortized into sg a over the expected sales realization cycle  typically one year or less 
our initial estimation of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular catalog is based on  among other possible considerations  our historical sales experience with identical or similar catalogs and our assessment of prevailing economic conditions  and various competitive factors 
we track our subsequent sales realization  reassess the marketplace  and compare our findings to our previous estimate and adjust our amortization going forward  if necessary 
goodwill and intangible assets at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
the recoverability of these assets requires considerable judgment and is evaluated on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
as it relates to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules in accordance with sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
 the recoverability of these assets is subject to a fair value assessment which includes several significant judgments regarding financial projections and comparable market values 
as it relates to definite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of which also requires significant judgment and assumptions related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset 
the impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and  thus  the recoverability of the asset 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our borrowings under our credit facility and our discount expense related to our receivable securitization are primarily dependent upon libor rates 
assuming no change in our financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average basis points higher during fiscal  pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on average variable rate debt outstanding and the average advanced under the receivable securitization during fiscal  excluding any impact of the swap agreement 
the estimated fair value of long term debt approximates its carrying value at april   with the exception of our convertible debt which at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million 
to manage interest rate risk on the variable rate borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility  we have historically entered into interest rate swap agreements 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
these interest rate swap agreements had the effect of locking in  for a specified period  the base interest rate we paid on a notional principal amount established in the swaps 
as a result  while these hedging arrangements were structured to reduce our exposure to interest rate increases  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise have received from any interest rate decreases 
the swaps were typically cash settled monthly  with interest expense adjusted for amounts paid or received 
the swap agreements had the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately million in fiscal and decreasing fiscal interest expense by approximately million 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
