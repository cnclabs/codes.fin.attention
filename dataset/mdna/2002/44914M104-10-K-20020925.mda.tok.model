hyperion was formed in august when arbor software  founded in  acquired hyperion software  founded in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from the licensing of our software products and providing maintenance and professional services 
our standard software license agreement is a perpetual license to use our products on an end user  concurrent user or central processing unit basis 
we record revenue from licensing of software products to end users provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of the product has occurred as prescribed by statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
for arrangements with multiple elements  and for which vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements based upon the residual method in accordance with sop  modifications of sop with respect to certain transactions 
vsoe of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately 
vsoe of fair value for services is based upon the standard hourly rate we charge for such services when sold separately 
vsoe of fair value for maintenance is measured by the stated renewal rates included in the contracts 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered  services have been performed or until fair value can be objectively determined 
license revenue from resellers or distributors is recognized upon sell through to the end customer 
amounts billed or payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
maintenance agreements are generally a month prepaid contract that is recognized ratably over the period 
customers may also enter into a professional services arrangement that is typically on a time and materials basis and includes consulting and training services 
consulting and training revenues are typically recognized as earned 
consulting revenues are generated primarily from implementation services related to the installation of our products 
these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from the license revenue because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop our services are generally not essential to the functionality of the software 
our 
table of contents products are fully functional upon delivery of the product and implementation does not require any significant modification or alteration 
our services often include assistance with product adoption 
other significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
customers generally purchase these services to facilitate the adoption of our products and obtain dedicated personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own internal resources or appoint other professional service organizations to provide these services 
payments related to the software product to which the services relate are typically billed independently from the services and  therefore  are not coincident with performance of such services 
license agreements generally do not include acceptance provisions 
if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements  license revenue is generally recognized together with the consulting services using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts and accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are made at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be adversely affected 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we record an expense within the tax provision in our statements of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily relating to net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires us to review for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 

table of contents when we determine that the carrying amount of long lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we assess the assets for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on the estimated future discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the of the asset using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  are determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets and future results of operations could be adversely affected 
results of operations revenues year ended june  percent of percent of percent of in thousands revenue revenue revenue software licenses maintenance and services maintenance    consulting and training   total revenues total revenues decreased in fiscal  compared to an increase of in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was attributable to lower license  consulting and training revenues as a result of continued cutbacks in technology spending amid a generally weak worldwide economy  a drop in revenues from older generation products that was more rapid than the increase in newer generation product revenues  and our increased emphasis on the use of our channel partners to provide consulting services to our customers 
the increase in fiscal was due to an increase in maintenance and services revenue  which was primarily attributable to a larger installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support services and an increase in technology product related services 
the change in foreign exchange rates from fiscal to fiscal did not have a material impact on fiscal results 
the change in foreign exchange rates from fiscal to fiscal negatively impacted fiscal results by approximately million  or of total revenue  due primarily to the decline in the euro  british pound sterling and the japanese yen against the us dollar 
total revenues generated from markets outside north america  including export sales  for fiscal  and were million  million and million  or  and of total revenues  respectively 
software licenses 
software license revenues decreased in fiscal  compared to a decrease of in fiscal while our average transaction size increased to approximately  for fiscal from approximately  for fiscal  we had a reduction in the total number of transactions  thus resulting in lower license revenue 
this decline was primarily attributable to continuing weak economic conditions both domestically and internationally  which has caused delays in our customer s capital spending  and a drop in revenues from older generation products that was more rapid than the increase in newer generation product revenues 
the decline in software license revenues in fiscal was due to a longer sales cycle caused by the economic weakness in north american sales 
channel revenues also declined as a percentage of total software revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal and application product revenue declined as a percentage of total software revenue as our new products were still in the early stages of their product life cycles 
the split between application and technology product license revenues was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal application license revenue is generated from our packaged financial and business performance management applications  and technology product license revenue is generated from hyperion essbase and related tools 
increasingly  we are winning deals by leading with our application products  which helps drive additional technology business as part of an integrated business performance management suite of products 
our two new financial 
table of contents application products  hyperion planning and hyperion financial management  largely accounted for the increase in application license revenue as a percentage of total license revenue in fiscal in fiscal  we signed more large deals with technology products included whereas in fiscal we sold a significant number of pure application product deals  which resulted in a decrease in application license revenue as a percentage of total license revenue in fiscal in addition  hyperion planning and hyperion financial management were still in the early stages of their product life cycles in fiscal and the first half of fiscal see the heading product enhancement and new product introductions involve inherent risk in the section entitled factors that may affect future results 
we market our products through our direct sales force and channel partners 
historically  we have generated the majority of our revenue from the direct sales force 
we continue to focus on complementing our direct sales force with channel partners  which consists of oems  vars  independent distributors and sales agents 
revenue from all channel partners comprised  and of license revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of total license revenue derived through our channel partners in fiscal was primarily due to a greater emphasis on effectively leveraging our channel partners 
this increase continues to bring us closer to our target for direct sales force and channel partner revenue split of 
no single partner represented more than of total revenue during fiscal  or maintenance and services 
maintenance and services revenue decreased in fiscal  compared to an increase of in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in consulting and training revenues 
consulting revenues decreased as a result of our increased use of our channel partners to provide consulting services and general economic weakness 
partially offsetting the decrease in consulting revenue was a increase in maintenance revenue  which was due to year over year growth of our installed customer base 
maintenance and services revenue increased in fiscal due primarily to the increase in services revenue related to the increase in technology product related services 
maintenance revenues increased in fiscal due to a larger installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support services 
cost of revenues year ended june  gross gross gross in thousands margin margin margin software licenses maintenance and services cost of software license revenues 
cost of software license revenues consists primarily of royalty expenses  cost of product packaging and documentation materials  amortization of capitalized software development costs and amortization of acquired technologies 
the decrease in the cost of software license revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the decrease in software license revenue and the related decrease in royalty payments to third parties 
the increase in the cost of software license revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal principally reflects increased royalty payments to third parties for software supplied by them and distributed by us 
the total cost of software license revenues as a percentage of license revenues was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  and  we capitalized million  million and million of software product development costs  respectively  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the amounts capitalized relate to development and localization of our software products 
capitalized software product development costs are amortized over the estimated economic life of the products  but generally for no more than three years 
the amortization of capitalized product development costs begins upon the general release of the software to customers 
cost of maintenance and services revenues 
the cost of providing maintenance and services consists largely of compensation and benefits for consulting  education and support personnel 
the decrease in cost of maintenance and services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to controls over headcount and employee related expenses  mainly as a result of our restructuring in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease was also due in part to a reduction in variable pay as a result of lower consulting revenues 
the continued gross margin improvement on maintenance and services revenue is a direct reflection of our focus on margin improvement and the results of rebalancing our cost structure 
the increase in the cost of maintenance and service revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to additional staffing expenses for both installation and ongoing support services 
these staffing expenses grew with an increase in headcount and utilization of independent contractors to assist with the implementation of our technology products 

table of contents operating expenses year ended june  percent of percent of percent of in thousands revenue revenue revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced a corporate restructuring plan designed to bring costs more in line with revenues and strengthen the financial performance of the business 
the restructuring plan included a company wide initiative to align personnel with our new strategy  which resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately  or of the worldwide headcount 
employee groups impacted by the restructuring include personnel involved in corporate services  product business units  sales and customer support 
in addition  we consolidated some of our facilities and exited other facilities 
we also focused on reducing all other discretionary expenditures with emphasis on travel costs and external consulting costs across all functional areas 
as a result of this restructuring plan and our strong focus on controlling costs in fiscal  total operating expenses are down from fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased in fiscal due to the restructuring plan and cost saving measures discussed above  as well as our continuing focus on marketing our products through our channel partners 
we have consolidated marketing activities into a centralized marketing organization to reduce overlap of marketing activities in an effort to support future revenue growth while at the same time control related expenses 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to decreases in marketing expenses of million and decreases in salaries and related employee expenses of million 
sales and marketing expense increased in fiscal due to incentive compensation payments to sales personnel  increases in compensation associated with additional headcount  and increases in marketing and promotional expenses associated with both a corporate branding advertising campaign and new product launches 
research and development 
research and development expense decreased in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in the utilization of independent contractors and temporary staffing of million and decreases in salaries and related employee expenses of million 
we have focused our efforts in research and development on our core products  thereby reducing our reliance on independent contractors and reducing operating costs 
research and development expense increased in fiscal due to increases in compensation and independent contractor expenses related to the release of new products and enhanced versions of existing products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased in fiscal due primarily to decreases in professional services and independent contractor expenditures of million and a decrease in bad debt expense of million 
these decreases are the direct result of our reduction in discretionary spending  as well as our focus on invoicing and collection process improvements 
general and administrative expense increased in fiscal due primarily to an increase in bad debt expense  fees related to the outsourcing of our accounting function and professional services fees related to our efforts to reduce our days sales outstanding 
restructuring and non recurring charges restructuring and non recurring charges totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the restructuring and non recurring charge in fiscal resulted from adjustments made to the restructuring and non recurring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents a summary of the fiscal restructuring and non recurring charge and reserve balance is as follows in thousands asset severance facilities impairments other total initial charge cash paid non cash reserve balance at june  cash paid adjustments reserve balance at june  as of june   we had communicated to all impacted employees regarding employee separation benefits and the timing of separation  and all positions had been separated or were in the separation process  resulting in cash payments of million 
additional payments of million were made during fiscal and the remaining severance payments of approximately million will be paid in the first half of fiscal all restructuring activities related to the disposal and or impairment of long term assets were completed as of june   and all restructuring activities associated with the consolidation of facilities were completed by june  approximately million of the million restructuring and non recurring charge recorded in fiscal did not require an outflow of cash  but the remaining million has required or will require the use of cash primarily payments due under long term lease obligations 
the reserve balance at june  of million  which relates primarily to future lease obligations  is included in other current liabilities and other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we substantially completed our restructuring activities related to the restructuring plan described above during fiscal  however payments due under long term lease obligations will continue to be made over the remaining lives of the leases 
if we are unable to maintain a cost structure that is in appropriate balance with revenue going forward  whether due to failure to increase revenue adequately or failure to keep costs down  we could find it necessary to further adjust our cost structure through the execution of additional restructuring plans 
in fiscal  we recorded a non recurring charge of approximately million associated with restructuring our european operations and costs associated with outsourcing our north american accounting department 
this charge was comprised primarily of severance costs  substantially all of which had been paid as of june  interest income and expense year ended june  percent percent in thousands change change interest income interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
although our cash and investment balances increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  interest income decreased due to the sharp decline in interest rates during fiscal interest income decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decrease in our cash and investment balances resulting primarily from the repurchases of our common stock and convertible subordinated notes and reduced employee stock option exercises in fiscal interest expense consists primarily of the interest paid and amortization of issuance costs related to the convertible subordinated notes we issued in march and the interest on our mortgage loan 
as discussed below  we repurchased convertible subordinated notes with a face value of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  thus reducing the amount of interest expense incurred during these years 
provision for benefit from income taxes our effective income tax rates for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
excluding the impact of restructuring and non recurring charges  our effective income tax rate was in fiscal our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal due to the elimination of a permanent difference related to the amortization of goodwill and a change in the geographical mix of income 
we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to remain at 

table of contents extraordinary gain during fiscal  we repurchased convertible subordinated notes with a face value of million for a total cost of million  resulting in an extraordinary gain of approximately million after income taxes  or approximately per share 
during fiscal  we repurchased convertible subordinated notes with a face value of million for a total cost of million  resulting in an extraordinary gain of approximately million after income taxes  or approximately per share 
depending on market conditions and other factors  we may repurchase additional convertible subordinated notes in the open market in fiscal net income loss as a result of the above factors  we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  and net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources year ended june  percent percent in thousands change change cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities to date  we have financed our business through positive cash flow from operations and  to a lesser extent  through the issuance of capital stock and convertible subordinated notes 
during fiscal  and  we invested our cash primarily in state and municipal bonds  us government and agency obligations  corporate notes and other highly liquid securities with maturities of three months or less 
in fiscal  and  we generated positive cash flow from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
the considerable increase in operating cash flows for fiscal was primarily attributable to the net income for the year and a significant decrease in accounts receivable  resulting from our focus on invoicing and collection process improvements 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures in fiscal  and consisted primarily of purchases of resources to manage our operations  including computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements 
the higher level of purchases of property and equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal and was attributable to the acquisition of several critical business systems during fiscal  including vantive  callidus and our erp platform 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal and net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was due to million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  which was partially offset by million used to repurchase convertible subordinated notes 
the negative cash flow from financing activities in fiscal primarily resulted from the repurchases of our common stock and convertible subordinated notes during the period 
in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock at market prices over the following twelve months 
pursuant to this repurchase program  we repurchased  shares during fiscal at a cost of approximately million 
during fiscal  we also repurchased convertible subordinated notes for a total cost of million 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan of million for fiscal during fiscal  the cash provided by financing activities resulted from proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan of million 
in fiscal  we also made principal payments of million related to the loan agreement with the connecticut development authority governing the million mortgage loan issued to us in to purchase an office and research facility in stamford  connecticut 

table of contents we intend to fund our capital requirements  as well as our liquidity needs  with existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as well as cash generated from future operations  if any 
however  capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  market acceptance of our products  the timing and extent of development projects and increases in operating expenses  all of which are subject to uncertainty 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  and cash generated from our future operations  if any  will be sufficient to finance our business through at least june  however  to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations are insufficient to fund future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles and reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is tested for impairment annually  and is tested for impairment between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level 
currently  we have identified one reporting unit under the criteria set forth by sfas no 
an impairment loss would generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets  including goodwill  exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we adopted sfas no 
on july   which resulted in us no longer amortizing our existing net goodwill balance of approximately million 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 intangible assets with a definite life are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from to years 
intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value 
fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the impact of sfas no

related party transactions in march  siebel systems  inc purchased several products from us for approximately million for purposes of implementing an enterprise wide financial planning system 
in addition  siebel has a future option to purchase the same products in accordance with normal contractual terms and conditions 
the chief financial officer of siebel is on our board of directors 
in march  we purchased approximately million of software  maintenance and services from siebel for the purpose of implementing a worldwide customer relationship management system 
we capitalized in property and equipment approximately million of this amount  as it related to software licenses  and recorded the remaining million in prepaid expenses 
the prepaid expenses are being amortized as the services are provided  and approximately million was amortized during the year ended june  factors that may affect future results we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
general economic conditions may adversely affect our business 
our revenue growth and profitability depend on the overall demand for computer software and services  which in turn depend on general economic and business conditions 
while we have been able to increase revenues sequentially over the last several quarters  continued softness in the economy could result in decreased revenues or lower growth rates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively promote revenue growth rates in all economic conditions 
product enhancement and new product introductions involve inherent risks 
we compete in a market characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware and software development  evolving standards 
table of contents in computer hardware and software technology and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
we continually expand and refresh our product offerings to include newer features or products  and enter into agreements allowing integration of third party technology into our products 
the introduction of new products or updated versions of continuing products has inherent risks  including  but not limited to  product quality  the fit of the new products and features with the customer s needs  the successful adaptation of third party technology into our products  educating our sales  marketing and consulting personnel to work with the new products and features  competition from earlier and more established entrants  general economic conditions  market acceptance of initial product releases  marketing effectiveness and the accuracy of assumptions about the nature of customer demand 
our failure to successfully introduce  market and sell new products and technologies or enhance and improve existing products in a timely manner  and position and or price its products  undetected errors or delays in new products or new versions of a product and or the failure of anticipated market growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial position 
these risks tend to be greater when newer products  such as hyperion financial management and hyperion planning  make up a larger portion of the overall product mix 
in the coming year  as more and more of these newer products are deployed  our service and maintenance organizations  along with our partners  will have to rapidly increase their ability to install and service these products  and we must rapidly improve their ease of implementation and ease of use 
the failure to successfully increase these capacities and make these improvements could result in significantly lower customer satisfaction  which could lead to lower revenue 
we operate in a very competitive environment 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive  highly fragmented and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
we have experienced  and expect that we will continue to experience  vigorous competition from both current and new competitors  some of whom may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
we expect additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter into both the olap and application parts of the business performance management software market 
this competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
changing our pricing could adversely affect our business 
in an effort to simplify and clarify our product positioning and marketing  we periodically make changes to our product pricing 
while we do not believe these pricing changes will have a material impact on license revenue  any such broadly based changes to pricing could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial position as customers change or delay their purchasing decisions in response to such pricing revisions 
additional risks of such pricing changes include delays in transactions as our sales force learns how to deploy the new pricing  and delay or loss of revenues as the competition reacts to the pricing changes 
in the future  intense competition in the various markets in which we compete may put pressure on us to reduce prices on certain products  particularly in the markets where certain vendors offer deep discounts in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products 
any such price reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial position 
we may not be able to continue our operational improvements 
as part of our focus on improving our operating margins  we are driving toward continued efficiencies in not only our sales force  but also our services  product development  product marketing  finance  and other administrative processes 
the ability to continue to realize current efficiencies  and find ways to improve on past performance is crucial to the improvement of operating margins 
any increase in the relative cost of these functions  or failure to continue to realize current efficiencies  could have a material adverse effect on our profits 
there is also a risk that  as newer sales  services and marketing strategies are implemented  the changes will either be unduly disruptive or less effective 
back ended quarters 
quarterly revenues and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of the signing of licensing agreements and product deliveries during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
significant portions of our quarterly software licensing agreements are concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter  generally with a concentration of such revenues earned in the final week of that month 
due to the relatively fixed nature of certain costs  including personnel and facilities expenses  a decline or shortfall in quarterly and or annual revenues typically results in lower profitability or may result in losses 
prior to the very end of any quarter  we must rely on our forecasts of revenue for planning  modeling and other purposes 
forecasts are only estimates and may not correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
a significant discrepancy between actual results and sales forecasts could cause us to improperly plan or budget and thereby adversely affect our business or results of operations 
any publicly stated revenue or earnings projections by us are especially subject to this risk 
restructuring may adversely affect productivity 
we have continued to restructure and make other adjustments to our sales and other operations and may do so in the future 
these changes have historically resulted in temporary sales or other productivity issues in the short term 
the restructured organization must keep 
table of contents improving over past performance in order to provide better operating margins and efficiencies 
failure of the organization to maintain or improve momentum and productivity could materially impact our revenue and profits 
international operations are subject to significant risks 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from international sales and is  therefore  subject to the related risks  including the general economic conditions in each country  the overlap of different tax structures  the difficulty of managing an organization spread over various countries  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  longer payment cycles  volatilities of exchange rates  import and export licensing requirements  trade restrictions and changes in tariff rates 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully address each of these challenges 
inability to hire and retain employees could harm our business 
our future operating results depend significantly upon the retention and hiring of technical and management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will retain our key managerial or technical personnel or attract such personnel in the future 
either directly or through personnel search firms  we actively recruit qualified development  sales and marketing personnel 
we have at times experienced difficulty recruiting or retaining qualified personnel and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such difficulties in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we will seek approval of additional stock options under our employee stock option plan at our annual meeting of stockholders 
stockholders have shown increasing reluctance to approve stock option plans 
we requested the stockholders approve additional shares for our employee option plan at our annual meeting of stockholders  and the additional shares were not approved 
if we are not able to offer prospective and current employees stock options on a basis generally comparable to other companies competing for the same workers  it will have a material adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain a competitive  motivated and dedicated workforce 
there are significant organizational and product integration risks related to business combinations 
we have made and may in the future make acquisitions of  mergers with  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies 
there are risks involved in business combinations  including but not limited to the possibility that we pay more than the value we derive from the acquisition  the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  the possibility that all aspects of the integration are not completed or that all of the anticipated synergies of the acquisition are not realized  the potential product liability associated with selling the acquired company s products  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial position  especially in the case of a large acquisition 
we are subject to the possibility of infringement claims 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting its proprietary rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by factors  including but not limited to  the announcement of new products  product enhancements or technological innovation by us or our competitors  changes in our or our competitors results of operations  changes in revenue  revenue growth rates and revenue mix for us as a whole or for specific geographic areas or business units  changes in earnings estimates by market analysts and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
technology stocks have experienced wide fluctuations in prices  which sometimes have been unrelated to their operating performance 
the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by such fluctuations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
at june   our investment portfolio consisted of investment grade debt securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  with a fair value of million 
the portfolio is invested in short term securities to minimize interest rate risk and for liquidity purposes in the event of immediate cash needs 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate increase in market interest rates would not have a material effect on our investment portfolio 
our long term debt bears interest at fixed interest rates and  therefore  relative to our long term debt  an immediate change in market interest rates would not have a material impact our financial condition or results of operations 
as of june   our long term debt consists of convertible subordinated notes due march with a face value of million and a mortgage loan with an outstanding principal balance of million bearing interest at 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we transact business in various foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
additionally  intercompany balances arise from software royalty fees that are charged to our foreign subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary 
from time to time  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain intercompany balances for which we anticipate settlement in the foreseeable future 
as a result  increases or decreases in our intercompany accounts due to foreign exchange rate changes are offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in our consolidated statements of income 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not material for fiscal  and we had no open foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of june  we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars upon consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for fiscal was not material
