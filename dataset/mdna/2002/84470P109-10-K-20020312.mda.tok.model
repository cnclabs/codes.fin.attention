item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of the company s results of operations for the years ended december   and and financial condition as of december  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes 
all share data has been adjusted to give retroactive recognition to stock splits and stock dividends 
critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgements and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgements and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgements and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgements and estimates which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
the company believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgements and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
refer to item entitled loan loss experience and reserve for loan loss and notes to financial statements no 
 summary of significant accounting and reporting policies for a detailed description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
forward looking information certain statements of other than historical fact that are contained in this document and in written material  press releases and oral statements issued by or on behalf of the company may be considered to be forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements may include words such as expect  estimate  project  anticipate  should  intend  probability  risk  target  objective and similar expressions 
forward looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
for example  certain market risk disclosures are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations 
see item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
by their nature  certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future 
as a result  actual income gains and losses could materially differ from those that have been estimated 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  either nationally or in the state of texas  legislation or regulatory changes which adversely affect the businesses in which the company is engaged  changes in the interest rate environment which reduce interest margins  significant increases in competition in the banking and financial services industry  changes in consumer spending  borrowing and saving habits  technological changes  the company s ability to increase market share and control expenses  the effect of compliance with legislation or regulatory changes  the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices and the costs and effects of unanticipated litigation 
financial condition total assets increased million or to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in net loans and a million increase in the securities portfolio 
the securities portfolio totaled million at december  compared to million at december  at december   net loans were million compared to million at december  the increase in loans and securities was funded primarily by fhlb dallas advances and deposits 
nonperforming assets at december  totaled million  representing of total assets  compared to million or of total assets at december  nonaccruing loans increased to  and the ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans increased to at december  as compared to  and at december  other real estate owned increased to  at december  from  at december  loans days past due at december  totaled  compared to million at december   a decrease of  restructured loans at december  totaled  compared to  at december   a decrease of  deposits increased million to million at december  from million at december  fhlb dallas advances were million at december   a million increase from million at december  short term fhlb dallas advances decreased million to million at december  from million at december  long term fhlb dallas advances increased million to million at december  from million at december  other borrowings at december  and totaled million and million  respectively  and at december  consisted of million short term borrowings  million of long term junior subordinated convertible debentures and million of long term junior subordinated debentures 
on november   the company through its wholly owned subsidiary  southside capital trust ii the trust ii issuer  sold  cumulative convertible preferred securities the junior subordinated convertible debentures at a liquidation amount of per convertible preferred security for an aggregate amount of  these securities have a convertible feature that allows the owner to convert each security to a share of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per common share 
these securities have a distribution rate of per annum payable at the end of each calendar quarter 
on may   the company through its wholly owned subsidiary  southside capital trust the trust issuer  sold  preferred securities the junior subordinated debentures at a liquidation amount of per preferred security for an aggregate amount of  these securities have a distribution rate of per annum payable at the end of each calendar quarter 
shareholders equity at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the increase primarily reflects the net income recorded for the year ended december  and an increase in the accumulated other comprehensive income of million  partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of the outstanding stock at an average price of per share and the payment of cash dividends 
during the economy in the bank s trade territory has shown some signs of slowing but appears stable 
the two areas of concern are the nationwide economic slowdown or recession and the personal bankruptcy rate 
management expects these trends to have some effect on the company s net charge offs 
management of the company  however  cannot predict whether current economic conditions will improve  remain the same or decline 
leverage strategy in may the company implemented a leverage strategy designed to enhance its profitability with acceptable levels of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
the leverage strategy consists of borrowing long and short term funds from the federal home loan bank and investing the funds primarily in mortgage backed securities  and to a lesser extent  long term municipal securities 
although mortgage backed securities often carry lower yields than traditional mortgage loans and other types of loans the company makes  these securities generally increase the overall quality of the company s assets by virtue of the securities underlying insurance or guarantees  are more liquid than individual loans and may be used to collateralize the company s borrowings or other obligations 
while the strategy of investing a substantial portion of the company s assets in mortgage backed and municipal securities has resulted in lower interest rate spreads and margins  the company believes that the lower operating expenses and reduced credit and interest rate risk of this strategy have enhanced its overall profitability 
the company will attempt to adopt a balance sheet strategy going forward to gradually reduce the securities portfolio as a percentage of earning assets 
on the liability side  the company will attempt to gradually reduce federal home loan bank borrowings as a percentage of total deposits 
the intended net result is to increase the company s net interest spread 
the leverage strategy is dynamic and requires ongoing management 
as interest rates  funding costs and security spreads change  the company s determination of the proper securities to own and funding to obtain must be re evaluated 
management has attempted to design the leverage strategy so that in a rising interest rate environment the interest income earned on the premium mortgage backed securities may increase to help offset the increase in funding costs 
as interest rates decrease the interest income on the premium mortgage backed securities may decrease due to increased prepayments on these securities as funding costs decrease 
due to the unpredictable nature of mortgage backed securities prepayments and the slope of the interest rate yield curve  net interest income could fluctuate more than simulated under alco scenarios modeled 
results of operations the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan  securities and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the company s noninterest income  provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses 
general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  also significantly affect the company s results of operations 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on the company 
comparison of operating results for the years ending december  compared to december  overview during the year ended december   the company s net income increased million or to million  from million for the same period in the increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest income and net interest income due to the increase in earning assets 
noninterest income increased primarily due to the gain on securities available for sale and increases in deposit services income 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense  provision for loan losses and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle due to the implementation of fas in the majority of the increase in noninterest expense was a result of bank growth and the costs associated with the opening of several new branches 
earnings per share of represented an increase of or over the year ended december  net interest income net interest income is the principal source of a financial institution s earnings stream and represents the difference or spread between interest and fee income generated from interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities materially impact net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to the same period in average interest earning assets increased million or  while the net yield on average earning assets decreased from at december  to at december  as interest rates decreased during  the company s premium mortgage backed securities decreased in yield as prepayment speeds increased 
this decrease in yield  along with the decrease in the yield on average loans  combined to decrease the net yield on average earning assets 
during the year ended december   average loans  funded by the growth in average deposits  increased million or  compared to the same period in the average yield on loans decreased from at december  to at december   reflective of an overall decrease in interest rates 
the increase in interest income on loans of million or was the result of the increase in average loans 
average investment and mortgage backed securities increased million or for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase was primarily a result of increasing the company s leverage strategy to offset interest expense associated with the convertible preferred securities issued in november the overall yield on average securities decreased to during the year ended december  from during the same period in  due in part to increased prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities which led to increased amortization expense 
the repositioning of the securities portfolio in an attempt to lower duration also decreased the overall yield on the securities portfolio 
interest income on investment and mortgage backed securities decreased  in or compared to due to the decrease in the average yield of securities during  which more than offset the increase in the average balance 
interest income from marketable equity securities  federal funds and other interest earning assets decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared to as a result of lower rates in and a special dividend of  in on the company s fhlb dallas stock which more than offset the average balance increase of 
during the year ended december   the mix of the company s interest earning assets reflected an increase in loans compared to the prior year end as loans averaged of total average interest earning assets compared to during  a direct result of significant loan growth 
securities averaged of the total and other interest earning asset categories averaged for december  during the comparable mix was in securities and in the other interest earning asset categories 
total interest expense increased million or to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the same period in the increase was attributable to an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million or 
average interest bearing deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased from at december  to at december  average time deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased basis points 
average interest bearing demand deposits increased million or and average savings deposits increased million or 
average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased during million or 
the latter three categories  which are considered the lowest cost deposits  comprised of total average deposits during the year ended december  compared to during and during the increase in average total deposits is reflective of overall bank growth and branch expansion 
during the second quarter ended june   the company issued million of long term brokered cds with one year call options and additional call options every six months thereafter  until the cds mature 
the average yield on these cds was with an average life of years 
obtaining this long term funding enabled the bank to take advantage of the higher interest rate environment  primarily through the purchase of securities without incurring significant additional interest rate risk 
the higher cost associated with these callable cds had a negative impact on net interest spread during the five quarters ended june  the options associated with these cds provided the bank with valuable balance sheet opportunities 
in conjunction with the issuance of these long term brokered cds  securities were purchased with an overall duration and yield approximately that of the brokered cds 
during march  the company notified cd holders that million of brokered cds were being called april  the company recorded  of additional interest expense associated with the call of the cds during the first quarter ended march  gains on sales of securities were used to offset this expense 
during april  the company notified cd holders that the remaining million of brokered cds would be called may  an additional  of expense was incurred during the second quarter ending june   associated with the call of the brokered cds 
these cds were replaced with long term advances from the fhlb at an average rate of approximately and an average life of approximately years 
as a result  the company s interest expense on this million declined after the cds were called 
during the second quarter ended june   the bank introduced a new platinum money market deposit account 
this account pays a higher rate on larger deposit balances than the bank s other money market account 
as deposits shift to the new money market account  the higher interest cost associated with this change will have a negative impact on net interest margin 
the bank hopes to attract new deposits due to the competitive rate of this account 
while the interest rate on this account is higher than the company s previous money market account  the interest rate is comparable to short term borrowings from the fhlb

average long term junior subordinated convertible debentures were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase is a result of the sale of  convertible preferred securities on november  at a liquidation amount of per convertible preferred security for an aggregate amount of  these securities have a distribution rate of per annum payable at the end of each calendar quarter 
average long term junior subordinated debentures remained the same at million from december  to december  average long term and short term interest bearing liabilities other than deposits increased million or  a direct result of replacing the long term brokered cds called during the second quarter ended june  with long term fhlb dallas advances

management of liquidity liquidity management involves the ability to convert assets to cash with a minimum of loss 
the company must be capable of meeting its obligations to its customers at any time 
this means addressing the immediate cash withdrawal requirements of depositors and other funds providers  the funding requirements of all lines and letters of credit  and the short term credit needs of customers 
liquidity is provided by short term investments that can be readily liquidated with a minimum risk of loss 
cash  interest earning deposits  federal funds sold and short term investments with maturities or repricing characteristics of one year or less continue to be a substantial percentage of total assets 
at december   these investments were of total assets  as compared with for december   and for december  liquidity is further provided through the matching  by time period  of rate sensitive interest earning assets with rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities 
the company has three lines of credit for the purchase of federal funds 
two million and one million unsecured lines of credit have been established with bank of america  frost bank and texas independent bank  respectively 
the asset liability management committee of the bank closely monitors various liquidity ratios  interest rate spreads and margins  interest rate shock reports and market value of portfolio equity with rates shocked plus and minus basis points to ensure the company a satisfactory liquidity position 
market value of portfolio equity is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
market value of portfolio equity analysis is the general measure used by regulatory authorities for assessing an institution s interest rate risk 
the extent to which assets will gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liabilities and or interest rate contracts determines the appreciation or depreciation in equity on a market value basis 
such market value analysis is intended to evaluate the impact of immediate and sustained parallel interest rate shifts of the current yield curve upon the market value of the current balance sheet 
in addition  the bank utilizes a simulation model to determine the impact of net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios 
by utilizing this technology  the bank attempts to determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mixes to minimize the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the banking industry  a major risk exposure is changing interest rates 
the primary objective of monitoring the company s interest rate sensitivity  or risk  is to provide management the tools necessary to manage the balance sheet to minimize adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates 
federal reserve board monetary control efforts  the effects of deregulation and legislative changes have been significant factors affecting the task of managing interest rate sensitivity positions in recent years 
the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities may be determined by analyzing the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by measuring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a defined time period if it matures or reprices within that period 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a defined period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to have a negative gap if the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
if more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice within a specified period  then the institution is considered to have a positive gap 
accordingly  in a rising interest rate environment in an institution with a negative gap  the cost of its rate sensitive liabilities would theoretically rise at a faster pace than the yield on its rate sensitive assets  thereby diminishing future net interest income 
in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap would indicate that the cost of rate sensitive liabilities would decline at a faster pace than the yield on rate sensitive assets and improve net interest income 
for an institution with a positive gap  the reverse would be expected 
the table on page shows interest sensitivity gaps for four different intervals as of december  in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management closely monitors the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management maintains an asset liability committee which meets regularly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting this position 
in addition  the board reviews on a monthly basis the company s asset liability position 
the company primarily uses two methods for measuring and analyzing interest rate risk net income simulation analysis and market value of portfolio equity modeling 
through these simulations the company attempts to estimate the impact on net interest income of a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
policy guidelines limit the estimated change in net interest income to percent of forecasted net income over the succeeding months and basis point parallel rate shock 
policy guidelines limit the change in market value of equity in a basis point parallel rate shock to percent of the base case 
the results of the valuation analysis as of december   were within policy guidelines 
this type of stimulation analysis requires numerous assumptions including but not limited to changes in balance sheet mix  prepayment assumptions and changes in spreads 
assumptions are based on management s best estimates but may not accurately reflect actual results under certain changes in interest rates 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
except for the effects of prepayments and scheduled principal amortization  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by the contractual term to maturity 
nonaccrual loans are not included in the loan totals

commercial and multi family real estate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and 
consumer loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and real estate mortgage investment conduits remics  have annual payment assumptions ranging from to 
at december   the contractual maturity of substantially all of the company s mortgage backed or related securities was in excess of ten years 
the actual maturity of a mortgage backed or related security is less than its stated maturity due to regular principal payments and prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of the security and affect its yield to maturity 
the yield to maturity is based upon the interest income and the amortization of any premium or discount related to the security 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  premiums and discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans  which decrease and increase interest income  respectively 
the prepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of the mortgage backed or related security  and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect actual prepayments 
although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors  including the type of mortgages  the coupon rate  the age of mortgages  the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates  the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments 
during periods of falling mortgage interest rates  if the coupon rate of the underlying mortgages exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans  refinancing may increase and accelerate the prepayment of the underlying mortgages and the related security 
at december   of the million of mortgage backed and related securities held by the company  an aggregate of million were secured by fixed rate mortgage loans and an aggregate of million were secured by adjustable rate mortgage loans 
the company assumes of savings accounts and transaction accounts at december   are core deposits and are  therefore  expected to roll off after five years 
the company assumes of money market accounts at december  are core deposits and are  therefore  expected to roll off after five years 
the company does not consider any of its platinum money markets accounts as core deposits 
no roll off rate is applied to certificates of deposit 
fixed maturity deposits reprice at maturity 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk 
the following table sets forth certain information as of december  with respect to rate sensitive assets and liabilities and interest sensitivity gap dollars in thousands mos

the asset liability management committee of southside bank closely monitors the desired gap along with various liquidity ratios to ensure a satisfactory liquidity position for the company 
management continually evaluates the condition of the economy  the pattern of market interest rates and other economic data to determine the types of investments that should be made and at what maturities 
using this analysis  management from time to time assumes calculated interest sensitivity gap positions to maximize net interest income based upon anticipated movements in the general level of interest rates 
regulatory authorities also monitor the bank s gap position along with other liquidity ratios 
in addition  the bank utilizes a simulation model to determine the impact of net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios 
by utilizing this technology  the bank can determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mixes to minimize the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios 
capital resources total shareholders equity at december  of million increased or million from december  and represented of total assets at december  compared to at december  the increase in the percent of shareholders equity to total assets is a result of the increase in the unrealized gains in the securities portfolio and the increase in net income 
net income for of million was the major contributor to the increase in shareholders equity at december  along with the net increase in unrealized gains of million on afs securities and the issuance of  in common stock  shares through the company s dividend reinvestment plan and incentive stock option plan 
decreases to shareholders equity consisted of million in dividends paid and the purchase of million in treasury stock  shares 
the company purchased treasury stock pursuant to a common stock repurchase plan instituted in late under the repurchase plan  the board of directors establishes  on a quarterly basis  total dollar limitations and price per share for stock to be repurchased 
the board reviews this plan in conjunction with the capital needs of the company and southside bank and may  at its discretion  modify or discontinue the plan 
during the third quarter of  the company issued a stock dividend  which had no net effect on shareholders equity 
the company s dividend policy requires that any cash dividend payments made by the company not exceed consolidated earnings for that year 
shareholders should not anticipate a continuation of the cash dividend simply because of the implementation of a dividend reinvestment program 
the payment of dividends will depend upon future earnings  the financial condition of the company  and other related factors 
the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and of tier capital as defined to average assets as defined 
management believes  as of december   that the bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject

effects of inflation the consolidated financial statements of the company  and their related notes  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  that require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike many industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services
