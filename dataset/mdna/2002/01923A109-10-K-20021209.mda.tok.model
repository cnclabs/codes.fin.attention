it is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating our financial position 
this discussion contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainty 
our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in this annual report on form k 
general we are one of the leading providers of healthcare staffing services  including nursing and ancillary services  to the uk healthcare industry 
we operate a community based network of over branches  with the capacity to provide nurses  carers known as home health aides in the us and specialized medical personnel to locations covering approximately of the population of the united kingdom 
we provide healthcare staffing services to hospitals  local governmental authorities  nursing homes and private patients in the uk through our uk operations  we also supply medical grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to the uk pharmacy market and to private patients in northern ireland 
our us operations  which are concentrated in new york and new jersey  supply infusion therapy  respiratory therapy and home medical equipment and accounted for less than of our revenues during the fiscal year ended september  we previously provided specialty pharmaceutical and medical supplies 
on october   we sold a substantial portion of the assets of our us mail order operations 
in addition  on november   we sold amcare  ltd 
amcare  a uk subsidiary 
on april   we entered into the reorganization agreement with two of our subsidiaries  allied healthcare uk and twuk  and certain investors in such subsidiaries 
both the reorganization agreement and reorganization were voted upon and approved at our company s annual meeting of shareholders on june  and the reorganization closed on july  in the reorganization o holders of redeemable shares of twuk exchanged their redeemable shares for shares of our common stock  using the net exercise method  and received either or shares of our common stock per redeemable share depending upon the exercise price of the redeemable share 
o holders of ordinary shares of twuk exchanged their ordinary shares for shares of our common stock at an exchange ratio of twuk ordinary shares for every one share of our common stock which is the equivalent of shares of our common stock for every ordinary share of twuk 
this ratio of twuk securities for our securities is referred to as the exchange ratio 
o all warrants held by the mezzanine lenders the mezzanine warrants of twuk that were issued in connection with the refinancing of our uk operations in were exercised for an aggregate of  ordinary shares of twuk 
each resulting ordinary share was exchanged for shares of our common stock 
o holders of the equity warrants of twuk the equity warrants that were issued in connection with the refinancing of our uk operations in exercised their equity warrants through the tender of the notes of allied healthcare uk exclusive of accrued and unpaid pik interest and received an aggregate of  ordinary shares of twuk 
each resulting ordinary share was exchanged for shares of our new series a preferred stock 
o holders of accrued and unpaid interest owed in respect of the notes issued by allied healthcare uk in the refinancing of our uk operations in were issued funding notes the loan notes by allied healthcare uk in the principal amount of the accrued and unpaid interest owed them through june   less amounts which are withheld from certain uk residents as withholding taxes  and the loan notes were in turn exchanged for shares of our common stock at the rate of shares for every pound of loan notes 
interest accrued on the notes through june  prior to the date on which the reorganization was consummated because the new shares of series a preferred stock became entitled to receive dividends commencing on june  as of september    shares of our common stock had been issued in settlement of accrued interest on the notes and an additional  shares were issued in december o lastly  the special voting share of twuk held by triumph partners iii  lp was exchanged for one ordinary share of twuk 
however  since conversion of this ordinary share at the exchange ratio would result in shares of our common stock being issued  it was agreed that  in the reorganization  zero shares of our common stock would be issued in respect of the ordinary share into which the special voting share has been exchanged 
as a result of the reorganization and other transactions  as fully described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  we recognized certain charges 
such amounts were partially offset by a gain on the settlement of accrued and unpaid interest owed to the holders of the notes of allied healthcare uk in exchange for new shares of our common stock 
our revenue mix and payor mix is influenced to a significant degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles 
the following table shows the percentage of historical net revenues represented by each of our product lines year ended year ended year ended september  september  september  product line net patient services net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales net infusion services total revenues the increase in net patient services and the decrease in other product lines as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to growth in our uk flexible staffing business both organically and through our on going nursing and care agency acquisition program 
the following table shows the historical payor mix for our total revenues for the periods presented year ended year ended year ended september  september  september  payor uk national health service and other uk governmental payors private payors medicare 
medicaid 
total revenues the increase in nhs and other uk governmental payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to the uk acquisitions  which derive the majority of their revenues from the nhs  and to organic growth in the core flexible staffing business 
the decrease in medicare as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to our exiting the us mail order business 
we believe that our payor mix in the future will be determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and to a lesser extent  from shifts in existing business among payors 
we believe that a substantial portion of our revenues derived from private payors in the us was subject to case management and managed care and that this relationship will continue in the future 
our gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of our product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates 
subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin 
at september   we had  of intangible assets primarily goodwill on our balance sheet compared to  at september  this represented of total assets and of total shareholders equity at september  and of total assets and of total shareholders equity at september  in accordance with the provisions of fas  all existing and newly acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives were not subject to amortization in fiscal amortization of intangibles for the year ended september  was  and  for the year ended september  subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to increase the amount of intangible assets on the balance sheet 
on a pro forma basis  assuming our uk subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended september   amortization of intangibles would have been  critical accounting policies accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivables  which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future as we continue to expand our business and as conditions in the marketplace change 
intangible assets we have significant amounts of goodwill 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant amount of judgment 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill 
deferred taxes we account for deferred income taxes based upon differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the determination of whether or not valuation allowances are required to be recorded involves significant estimates regarding the future profitability of our company  as well as potential tax strategies for the utilization of net loss and operating loss carry forwards 
contingencies related to our acquisitions of flexible staffing agencies  we have entered into agreements to pay additional amounts  in cash  as contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of such acquired entities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended september during the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
revenue recognition patient services and infusion and respiratory therapy revenues are recognized when services are performed and are recorded net of estimated contractual adjustments based on agreements with third party payors  where applicable 
revenues from the rental of home medical equipment including respiratory equipment are recognized over the rental period typically on a month to month basis 
revenues from the sale of pharmaceuticals and supplies are recognized when products are shipped and are recorded at amounts expected to be paid by third party payors 
we receive a majority of our revenue from third party insurance companies  the nhs and other uk governmental payors  medicare and medicaid 
the amount paid by third party payors is dependent upon the benefits included in the patient s policy or as allowable amounts set by third party payors 
certain revenues are subject to review by third party payors  and adjustments  if any  are recorded when determined 
results of operations year ended september  vs 
year ended september  revenues total revenues for the year ended september  were  compared to  for the year ended september   an increase of  or excluding the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange 
this increase relates primarily to the growth of our company s uk flexible staffing operations as a result of acquisitions  principally staffing enterprise limited and staffing psv limited collectively staffing enterprise  crystalglen limited operating under the trade name nurses direct  and balfor medical  with the remaining increase  principally reflecting organic growth in the staffing operations

as a percentage of total revenue  gross profit for the year ended september  decreased to from for the comparable prior period 
gross margins for patient services decreased for the year ended september  versus for the comparable prior period principally due to an increase in the percentage of revenues derived from the staffing of nurses and other more highly paid professionals  which have lower margins than the historical carer business 
in addition  uk regulatory changes  which extend the entitlement of holiday pay to temporary workers  served to reduce gross margins in the current year 
gross margins in the respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales increased for the year ended september  versus for the comparable prior period mainly due to the sales mix 
gross margins for infusion services slightly decreased for the year ended september  versus for the comparable prior period principally due to product sales mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september   an increase of excluding the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange 
the increase reflects  representing certain tax equalization bonuses paid to senior management for the reimbursement of income taxes incurred as a result of share issuances and the higher level of overhead costs in our uk operations due principally to acquisitions and internal growth 
this increase was partially offset by the application of financial accounting standards board fas  goodwill and other intangible assets fas  effective october   whereby goodwill is no longer being amortized

provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to  or of income before income taxes and minority interest for the year ended september  versus a provision of  for the year ended september  the difference between the effective tax rate for the year ended september  and the statutory tax rate is due to our recording of an additional valuation allowance for the tax benefit associated with the current year s us operating loss 
we had been previously committed to implementing tax strategies that provided for the sale of appreciated assets  including a portion of our ownership interest in our uk subsidiary  to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the tax net operating losses prior to their expiration 
while we believe we will eventually realize the value of our tax losses  current developments  including the continued expansion of our uk operations has increased the uncertainty as to both the execution of the original strategy and the appropriateness of a tax strategy which may not align with our current business strategy 
these uncertainties have impaired our ability to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a full valuation allowance for all remaining deferred tax assets was provided 
minority interest we reported a charge for minority interest of  in the year ended september  compared to a charge of  in the year ended september  the minority interest represented the  shares of class a common stock of twuk issued as part of the nightingale consideration
