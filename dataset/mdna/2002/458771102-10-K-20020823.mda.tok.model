item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations intermagnetics general corporation intermagnetics  company  we or us makes forward looking statements in this document 
typically  we identify forward looking statements with words like believe  anticipate  perceive  expect  estimate and similar expressions 
unless a passage describes an historical event  it should be considered a forward looking statement 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve important assumptions  risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the company s actual results for fiscal year and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
these important factors include  without limitation  the assumptions  risks  and uncertainties set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as other assumptions  risks  uncertainties and factors disclosed throughout our annual report on form k 
except for our continuing obligations to disclose material information under federal securities laws  we are not obligated to update these forward looking statements  even though situations may change in the future 
we qualify all of our forward looking statements by these cautionary statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon  in part the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
the company recognizes revenue and profit on long term development contracts based upon the lesser of  milestones achieved or costs incurred plus earned profit 
some of these contracts require the company to contribute to the development effort 
should the actual costs exceed the estimates for these development efforts and the company was not successful in securing additional funding it may be necessary to record additional expense 
the company maintains a reserve for inventory that may become damaged in the manufacturing process or technologically obsolete 
if technology advances more rapidly than expected  manufacturing processes improve substantially or the market for our products declines substantially  additional reserves may be required 
the provision for warranty for potential defects with our manufactured products is based on historical experience for the period the product was under warranty during the fiscal year 
the company believes this reserve is adequate based on the evaluation criteria  procedures in place to control the manufacturing process and pre testing of newly developed products to ensure their manufacturability prior to commercial introduction 
if product quality declines the company may require additional provisions 
the company maintains a provision for potential environmental remediation for businesses disposed of during the current fiscal year 
these provisions are based upon estimates from environmental engineers that have visited the sites and understand the scope of the project  should a cleanup be required 
the company believes these provisions are adequate based on estimates from environmental engineers 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment 
should this occur the company would be required to record an impairment charge in the future 
company overview we operate in three reportable operating segments magnetic resonance imaging mri  instrumentation  and energy technology 
the mri segment consists primarily of the manufacture and sale of magnet systems by the igc magnet business group and radio frequency coils by igc medical advances inc 
these products are used principally in the medical diagnostic imaging market 
until october  this segment also included the manufacture and sale of low temperature superconducting wire by our igc advanced superconductor division igc as 
the instrumentation segment consists of refrigeration equipment produced by igc polycold systems inc igc polycold 
these systems are used primarily in ultra high vacuum applications  industrial coatings  analytical instrumentation  medical diagnostics and semiconductor processing and testing 
for the first three quarters of fiscal year  this segment also included igc apd cryogenics inc igc apd 
the energy technology segment  operated through superpower  inc is developing second generation  high temperature superconducting materials that we expect to use in devices designed to enhance capacity  reliability and quality of transmission and distribution of electrical power 
we completed two major divestitures in fiscal year on october   we sold the assets and business of igc as to outokumpu copper products oy 
on february   we sold all of the outstanding shares of igc apd to sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
these transactions are discussed in more detail below 
through february   the company reported its operations in four segments electromagnetics  low temperature superconductors  refrigeration  and energy technology 
the change to these segments reflects our continued focus on commercial market applications of core technology 
the resulting reporting segments are intended to relate to the primary markets which each serves  rather than the technologies that give rise to individual products 
prior year segment data has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 
through october  the refrigeration segment included a refrigerant business that we exited for strategic reasons 
intersegment sales and transfers are accounted for as if the sales or transfers were to third parties  that is  at current market prices 
the company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on operating income loss 
the company operates on a week fiscal year ending the last sunday during the month of may 
we also have a foreign sales corporation located in barbados  which we plan to discontinue as a result of the extraterritorial income exclusion act of the act provides for an exclusion from gross income of a percentage of income attributable to certain activities performed outside the united states 
this exclusion is designed to parallel the treatment of foreign sourced income by other countries and contains no requirement for a separate foreign entity to obtain the benefit 
results of operations during fiscal we completed two major divestitures 
on october   we sold the assets and business of igc as to outokumpu copper products oy 
on february   we sold all of the outstanding shares of igc apd to sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
additionally the company had non recurring expenses of about million related to moving our san rafael california plant and our mixed gas product line to petaluma  california 
throughout the following analysis reference will be made to on going operations 
when we refer to on going operations we are excluding the effect of igc as and igc apd in both fiscal and as well as the effect of the nonrecurring expense in fiscal for the year ended may   sales increased by or million  to million  compared with an increase of for the preceding year 
on going operations had sales increase of million to million  or 
sales of the mri segment increased by million  or  primarily a result of increased product demand  by philips medical systems pms as well as other customers 
this increase more than offset a decline in sales of low temperature superconducting wire resulting from the sale of essentially all of the assets of igc as 
sales from on going operations in the mri segment increased million or nearly 
in the prior year  mri segment sales increased by million  or  most of which was a result of strong demand by pms and the transfer of magnet production from our former french joint venture aisa for the entire year  versus only a partial year in fiscal these increases more than offset a decline in sales of low temperature superconducting wire to external customers  as more of the total wire production was devoted to internal needs 
sales of the instrumentation segment decreased by million  or  to million from million 
approximately million or of the total decline from fiscal resulted from a decrease in product demand for refrigeration equipment caused  in part  from a slow down in the economy 
in addition  we experienced unusually high sales in this segment in the prior fiscal year 
another million or of the decline was related to the sale of igc apd and the relocation of our san rafael  california plant to a new modern facility in petaluma  california 
sales from on going operations in this segment declined million or about relating to decreased customer demand and unusually high sales in the prior fiscal year 
in the prior fiscal year  sales of instrumentation products increased by million  or  resulting from a large increase in demand for the company s refrigeration equipment in areas such as optical filters used to increase capacity of the data transmitted on fiber optic cable networks 
this increase was partially offset by a million  or decline in the sale of refrigerants resulting from our decision to exit the refrigerant business 
sales in the energy technology segment increased by million  or  to million primarily from increased outside funding for superconducting devices 
the company continues to focus its efforts on successfully manufacturing second generation superconductor and first generation devices 
in the prior year sales in the energy technology segment were essentially unchanged at million 
the company believes  in general  that first generation conductors consisting of ceramic compounds in a silver matrix will be unable to achieve cost and performance targets necessary to make devices produced with this material economically feasible 
accordingly  we are developing conductors in which the superconducting compounds are deposited on a lower cost substrate 
while they have not yet resulted in increased sales  we have developed important relationships and cooperative agreements for the pursuit of this approach  and we continue to seek additional partners to assist in the development and marketing of these products 
gross margin in fiscal increased million to million 
about million is related to increased customer demand  active cost reduction programs and improved product mix from magnet systems and additional customer funding for research and development 
these increases were offset by a reduction of million resulting from disposed businesses mentioned previously as well as a decrease of about million relating to reduced demand for instrumentation products 
additionally  prior year margin had the benefit of million of inventory recovered from the related restructuring recorded in fiscal as a percent of sales  margins decreased to from 
margins on an on going basis would have increased million to million primarily as a result of increased demand for magnet systems  active cost reduction programs and improved product mix as well as additional customer funding for research and development 
again  increased margins on an on going basis were offset by reduced contribution related to decreased customer demand within the instrumentation sector 
in the previous years  excluding the effects of inventory written off in restructurings in fiscal and recoveries in fiscal  gross margins increased to million  or of sales  from million  or in fiscal this increase was due principally to the large increase in sales  coupled with an improved mix of sales in both rf coils and instrumentation 
in addition  the substantial reduction in refrigerant sales resulting from the previously described decision to exit that business helped improve gross margins  as these were low margin sales 
product research and development increased million or to million 
approximately million of this increase was a result of increased efforts of the mri segment relating to new magnet and rf coil designs 
the company expects to generate initial sales from these development activities within the coming fiscal year 
another million is related to our efforts to develop second generation superconductor and first generation devices for the energy technology market 
we view this as a longer term investment that is not expected to generate near term sales 
finally  in fiscal the company increased research and development in the refrigeration segment by about  this effort is dedicated to understanding our customer s needs and creating a product to satisfy those needs 
we expect the results of this effort will generate initial sales in fiscal in the prior fiscal year product research and development increased by to million  from million in fiscal substantially all of the increase was due to programs to develop new magnet systems  new refrigeration applications to broaden the instrumentation product line and a substantial increase in our hts activities in the energy technology segment 
marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased by about million  or 
the majority of this decrease is related to the sale of igc as and igc apd 
spending in the mri segment declined from prior year as a result of reduced selling expenses and legal fees related to patent defense 
these reductions were partially offset by increased spending for information technology  primarily related to increased staffing 
marketing expense in the instrumentation segment increased in accordance with our business model to focus on customer intimacy 
finally  there was modest increased spending from the energy technology segment in fiscal related to increased staffing 
on an on going basis marketing  general and administrative would have increased about million or had the sale of businesses not occurred 
in fiscal these expenses increased by about million or 
in addition to a substantial increase in the level of expenditures devoted to the energy technology segment  we also had higher compensation costs resulting from both increased staff levels and higher incentive compensation resulting from the improved overall performance 
in addition  we had higher consulting and stock based compensation costs and certain expenditures associated with a termination of the company s traditional defined benefit pension plan and subsequent transition to a fixed  defined contribution plan 
amortization of intangible assets decreased million as a result of the adoption of statement of accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the prior year amortization of intangible assets increased by about million resulting from a full year of amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the termination of our aisa joint venture 
overall for fiscal  operating income increased about million or to million 
this increase includes the effect of the disposition of certain businesses  expenses related to the transfer of mixed gas and the move of our san rafael california plant to petaluma california 
on an on going basis  operating income would have increased approximately  or 
it is important to note that prior year includes the benefit of million of operating income related to the recovery of a restructuring charge 
without that benefit in the prior year  operating income from on going operations would have increased million or 
in the prior year operating income more than doubled to million due primarily to the much higher level of sales and gross margins 
interest income increased about  or to nearly million 
this increase is due primarily to increased cash 
interest expense decreased million or to nearly  related primarily to the conversion of our subordinated debentures 
during fiscal our ownership in an investment that was accounted for using the equity method of accounting was diluted below  and  accordingly  we ceased applying the equity method 
also  in fiscal  we recorded a recovery of a portion million of a fiscal provision for guarantees of indebtedness of a uk company in which we had an investment 
the investment had also been written off in fiscal  and in fiscal  proceeds from the company s liquidation reduced our obligation under the guarantee 
on october   we divested our low temperature superconducting lts materials business  igc advanced superconductors of waterbury  connecticut  for more than million 
the purchase price consisted of a million note  payable over two years  which was recorded at present value of million  and the balance in cash 
the agreement between intermagnetics and outokumpu copper products oy  a subsidiary of the outokumpu group of finland  also includes a six year strategic supply arrangement that will expand outokumpu s existing superconducting materials business 
intermagnetics will purchase from outokumpu a substantial portion of the lts wire it requires internally  primarily for manufacturing superconducting magnet systems for magnetic resonance imaging systems 
intermagnetics will receive up to an additional million if it attains specified levels of lts wire purchases over the first two years of the agreement 
excluding that payment  the sale resulted in a one time pre tax gain of approximately million 
additionally  the company recorded stock based compensation expense of  related to the sale 
on february   the company sold the stock of its subsidiaries igc apd cryogenics  inc and ig europe  ltd 
the sale was subject to a stock purchase agreement between the company and sumitomo heavy industries shi of japan dated january  the sale to shi included only the helium related assets of these subsidiaries and the assumption of related liabilities 
the purchase consideration was arrived at by arms length negotiation and consisted of million in cash paid on february  the company was also able to withdraw an additional million in cash prior to closing 
the net pretax gain from the sale was  the agreement includes a six year strategic supply agreement under which the company will purchase from shi shield coolers it requires internally  primarily for manufacturing superconducting magnet systems 
the mixed gas portion of the refrigeration systems business  previously conducted at igc apd  was transferred and integrated into igc polycold  inc additionally  the company recorded stock based compensation expense of  related to the sale 
in connection with these dispositions the company has established a liability for environmental remediation and penalties of approximately million 
essentially all of this liability remains on our balance sheet at the end of fiscal during fiscal the company evaluated the probability of realizing the value of our investments in ultralife batteries inc and kryotech 
as a result  the company determined these investments were impaired and accordingly wrote down ultralife batteries inc to current market value as of november  and kryotech to zero  its estimated value 
the write down amounted to million and was due to a decline in fair market value of these investments  which  in the opinion of management  is other than temporary 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and capital gains during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers projected future taxable income  the character of such income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the company had federal taxable income of approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of the remaining deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
looking forward  we expect to continue to maintain our investment in energy technology in order to be ready when the market for these products begins to develop  which we believe will be about the middle of the decade 
despite this investment  and relatively flat sales from on going operations  we expect net operating profit to increase in fiscal by about compared to reported fiscal as a result of our streamlined business focus  cost containment and manufacturing efficiencies 
a portion of this growth is expected to come from sales of high t field and open magnet systems as well as new products being developed at igc medical advances and igc polycold 
these products were being developed at the end of last fiscal year and continue to be developed now 
our customers are intimately involved in the definition and development of these products 
additionally  the company has an active cost cutting program in each of its divisions to increase earnings 
these expectations are based on the following assumptions  among others o the market for mri systems continues to grow  o customer acceptance of the new products being developed throughout the company  o current order trends for mri magnets to continue  o new products achieve the level of growth and market acceptance expected  o the slowing economy doesn t cause any further pullback in instrumentation orders  and  o we are able to maintain gross margins through continued production cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies 
liquidity and capital resources we generated approximately million in cash from operating activities 
primarily this cash is a result of continued proactive management of our balance sheet  which is also reflected in our operating efficiency 
investing activities provided approximately million  primarily from the sale of divisions partially offset by cash used for the purchase of plant property and equipment for machinery and tooling required for new product introduction and research and development as well as increased capacity 
additionally we received million from the exercise of stock options and  as repayments of employee loans 
we used million of this cash on financing activities  as principal payments for long term debt 
we had a net increase in cash of million  bringing our cash balance to million 
see the consolidated statement of cash flows  located elsewhere in this report  for further details on sources and uses of cash 
during fiscal year  the final million of our convertible subordinated debentures were converted into  shares of our common stock at per share 
additionally  we issued  shares of common stock valued at an average of per share to induce early conversion and in lieu of all accrued interest 
our capital and resource commitments at august st  consisted of capital equipment commitments of  we have a million unsecured line of credit with three banks 
borrowings under the line bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor or prime plus an applicable margin at our option 
the credit line expires in october there are currently no borrowings under the credit line 
we believe we have adequate resources to meet our needs for the short term from our existing cash balances  our expected cash generation in the current fiscal year  and our line of credit 
longer term  with substantial increases in sales volume and or unusually large research and development or capital expenditure requirements to pursue new opportunities in the energy technology segment  we could need to raise additional funds 
we would expect to be able to do so through additional lines of credit  public offerings or private placements of securities 
however  in the event funds were not available from these sources  or on acceptable terms  we would expect to manage our growth within the financing available 
inflation has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk the company s exposure to market risk through derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments  such as investments in short term marketable securities and long term debt  is not material 
the financial instruments of the company that are interest rate dependent are revenue bonds issued in connection with the acquisition of certain land  building and equipment  an unsecured line of credit and a mortgage payable 
the company manages interest rates through various methods within contracts 
on its mortgage payable  the company negotiated an interest rate swap agreement that  in effect  fixes the rate at 
with respect to its unsecured line of credit  the company may elect to apply interest rates to borrowings under the line which relate to either the london interbank offered rate or prime  whichever is most favorable 
see note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in response to item for more details regarding these instruments 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of changing rates on earnings and cash flow and to lower its borrowing costs 
additionally  the company makes certain estimates about inventory value  collectability of accounts receivable  warranty expense and market acceptance and pricing of new product under development 
we use factors such as probability of use  ability of a customer to pay  historical experience of product repair and customer need and or acceptance of new products in making the associated estimates 
these estimates are believed to be reasonable and based on information available at the time the estimate is made 
the company does not believe that its exposure to commodity and foreign exchange risks are material 
we limit our exposure to these risks by denominating contracts  such as our contract with pms  in dollars
