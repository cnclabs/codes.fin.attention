also  due primarily to the seasonal nature of the company s business  the company maintains significant inventories of peanuts  pecans  walnuts  almonds and other nuts at certain times of the year  especially during the second and third quarters of the company s fiscal year

critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks  if applicable  for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at the amounts charged to customers  less i an allowance for doubtful accounts  ii a reserve for estimated cash discounts  and iii a reserve for customer deductions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated by specifically identifying customers that are credit risks 
the reserve for estimated cash discounts is estimated using historical payment patterns 
the reserve for customer deductions represents an estimate of future credit memos that will be issued to customers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
fluctuations in the market price of peanuts  pecans  walnuts  almonds and other nuts may affect the value of the company s inventory and thus the company s gross profit and gross profit margin 
if market prices move substantially lower  the company would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of inventories to fair market value 
customer incentives the ability to sell to certain retail customers often requires upfront payments by the company 
such payments are made pursuant to contracts that usually stipulate the term of the agreement  the quantity and type of products to be sold and any exclusivity requirements 
the cost of these payments is initially recorded as an asset and is amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract as a reduction in revenues

these related party transactions are conducted on an arm s length basis

these forward looking statements  which generally are followed and therefore identified by a cross reference to factors that may affect future results or are identified by the use of forward looking words and phrases such as intend  may  believes and expects  represent the company s present expectations or beliefs concerning future events 
the company cautions that such statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including the factors described below under factors that may affect future results  as well as the timing and occurrence or non occurrence of transactions and events which may be subject to circumstances beyond the company s control 
consequently  results actually achieved may differ materially from the expected results included in these statements 
factors that may affect future results availability of raw materials and market price fluctuations the availability and cost of raw materials for the production of the company s products  including peanuts  pecans and other nuts are subject to crop size and yield fluctuations caused by factors beyond the company s control  such as weather conditions and plant diseases 
additionally  the supply of edible nuts and other raw materials used in the company s products could be reduced upon a determination by the united states department of agriculture the usda or other government agency that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
shortages in the supply and resulting increases in the prices of nuts and other raw materials used by the company in its products to the extent that cost increases cannot be passed on to customers could have an adverse impact on the company s profitability 
furthermore  fluctuations in the market prices of nuts may affect the value of the company s inventories and the company s profitability 
the company has significant inventories of nuts that would be adversely affected by any decrease in the market price of such raw materials 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
competitive environment the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company s principal products compete against food and snack products manufactured and sold by numerous regional and national companies  some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than the company  such as planters and ralcorp holdings  inc the company also competes with other shellers in the industrial market and with regional processors in the retail and wholesale markets 
in order to maintain or increase its market share  the company must continue to price its products competitively 
this competitive pricing may lower revenue per unit and cause declines in gross margin  if the company is unable to increase unit volumes as well as reduce its costs 
fixed price commitments from time to time  the company enters into fixed price commitments with its customers 
such commitments typically represent approximately of the company s annual net sales and are normally entered into after the company s cost to acquire the nut products necessary to satisfy the fixed price commitment is substantially fixed 
however  the company expects to continue to enter into fixed price commitments with respect to certain of its nut products prior to fixing its acquisition cost when  in management s judgment  market or crop harvest conditions so warrant 
to the extent the company does so  these fixed price commitments may result in losses 
historically  however  such losses have generally been offset by gains on other fixed price commitments 
however  there can be no assurance that losses from fixed price commitments may not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
termination of federal peanut quota program peanuts are an important part of the company s product line 
approximately of the total pounds of products processed annually by the company are peanuts  peanut butter and other products containing peanuts 
the production and marketing of peanuts had been regulated by the usda under the agricultural adjustment act of the agricultural adjustment act 
the agricultural adjustment act  and regulations promulgated thereunder  supported the peanut crop by i limiting peanut imports  ii limiting the amount of peanuts that american farmers were allowed to take to the domestic market each year  and iii setting a minimum price that a sheller had to pay for peanuts which could be sold for domestic consumption 
the amount of peanuts that american farmers could sell each year was determined by the secretary of agriculture and was based upon the prior year s peanut consumption in the united states 
only peanuts that qualified under the quota could be sold for domestic food products and seed 
the peanut quota for the crop year which ended on july  was approximately million tons 
peanuts in excess of the quota were called additional peanuts and generally could only be exported or used domestically for crushing into oil or meal 
regulations permitted additional peanuts to be domestically processed and exported as finished goods to any foreign country 
the quota support price for the crop year was approximately per ton 
the farm bill extended the federal peanut quota program for peanuts for seven years 
the farm security and rural investment act of the farm bill terminated the federal peanut quota program beginning with the crop year 
the farm bill replaces the federal peanut quota program with a fixed  decoupled payment system through the crop year 
additionally  among other provisions  the secretary of agriculture may make certain counter cyclical payments whenever the secretary believes that the effective price for peanuts is less than the target price 
the termination of the federal peanut quota program could significantly affect the supply of  and price for  peanuts 
although the company has successfully operated in a market shaped by the federal peanut quota program for many years  the company believes that it will adapt to a market without a quota program 
however  the company has no experience in operating in such a peanut market  and no assurances can be given that the elimination of the federal peanut quota program would not adversely affect the company s business 
while the company believes that its ability to use its raw peanut inventories in its own processing operations gives it greater protection against these changes than is possessed by certain competitors whose operations are limited to either shelling or processing  no assurances can be given that the elimination of the federal peanut quota program will not adversely affect the company s business 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has not entered into transactions using derivative financial instruments 
the company believes that its exposure to market risk related to its other financial instruments which are the debt instruments under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources is not material
