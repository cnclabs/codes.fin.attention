broadwing inc the company is a full service local and national provider of data and voice communications services  and a regional provider of wireless communications services 
the company seeks to provide world class service on a national level by combining two sets of strengths its national optical network and internet backbone and its state of the art local network with a well regarded brand name and reputation for service 
the company operates in four business segments broadband  local  wireless and other 
a further discussion of these segments and their operating results is discussed in item  business  and in the individual segment discussions which begin on page of this report on form k 
this report and the related consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contain certain forward looking statements that involve potential risks and uncertainties 
the company s future results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed herein 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
the company undertakes no obligation to review or update these forward looking statements or to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
the company continually evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  fixed assets  access line costs  restructuring  reciprocal compensation  pensions  other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies impact its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for a more detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company generally recognizes revenue as services are provided 
local service revenue is billed monthly  in advance  with revenue being recognized when earned 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon performance of contractual obligations  such as shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance 
indefeasible right of use agreements  or irus  represent the lease of network capacity or dark fiber and are recorded as unearned revenue at the earlier of the acceptance of the applicable portion of the network by the customer or the receipt of cash 
the buyer of iru services typically pays cash upon execution of the contract  and the associated iru revenue is then recognized over the life of the agreement as services are provided  beginning on the date of customer acceptance 
directory publishing revenue and related directory costs are deferred and recognized over the life of the associated directory 
for certain long term construction contracts  the company recognizes revenue and the associated cost of that revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
the method is used as the company can make reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract 
as the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are continually assessed throughout the terms of the contracts  revenue recognized is subject to revision as the contract nears completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
revisions have the potential to impact both revenue and cost of services and products 
construction projects are considered substantially complete upon customer acceptance 
pricing of local services is subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 
such regulation also covers services  competition and other public policy issues 
different interpretations by regulatory bodies may result in adjustments to revenue in future periods 
the company monitors these proceedings closely and adjusts revenue accordingly 
since its merger with ixc in november  the company has not entered into any significant fair value fiber exchange agreements 
for certain preacquisition fiber exchange agreements with other carriers  the company recognizes the fair value of revenue earned and the related expense in offsetting amounts over the life of the agreement 
in no instances has the company recognized revenue upon execution of any such fiber exchange agreements or capitalized any expenses associated therewith 
deferred tax asset as of december   the company had operating loss tax carryforwards with a related tax benefit of million 
for certain state and local jurisdictions that the company has determined it is more likely than not that the loss carryforwards will not be realized  the company has provided a valuation allowance  which amounted to million as of december  in evaluating the amount of valuation allowance  the company considers prior operating results  future taxable income projections  expiration of tax loss carryforwards and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
based on this evaluation and on the assumptions used as of december   the company believes the realization of this deferred tax asset for federal and unitary state purposes is reasonably assured 
if these estimates change  the revision to the valuation allowance would impact income tax expense and net income in the period recorded 
the tax loss carryforwards will generally expire between and asset impairments as of december   the company had fixed assets with a net carrying value of billion  intangible assets of billion and goodwill of billion 
the value of these assets is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount  with the loss measured based on discounted expected cash flows 
the company performed an evaluation of both its tangible and intangible assets as of december  and determined that the assets were not impaired under the accounting guidance then in effect 
as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is required to implement statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  on january  the company expects the implementation will require a write down of its goodwill in excess of billion 
the carrying value of goodwill was billion as of december  the company will record the goodwill impairment as a change in accounting principle as permitted under sfas after june   revisions to the estimated cash flows and profitability used to assess the carrying value of fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets would impact operating expense in the period recorded 
pension and postretirement benefits annually  the company calculates net periodic pension and postretirement expenses and liabilities on an actuarial basis under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
the key assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these numerous assumptions  which are reviewed annually  include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate is selected based on current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the participants benefit horizon  the mix of investments held directly by the plans and the current view of expected future returns  which is influenced by historical averages 
the health care cost trend rate is based on actual claims experience and future projections of medical cost trends 
a revision to these estimates would impact costs of services and products and selling  general and administrative expenses 
results of operations on november   the company completed its merger the merger with ixc communications  inc ixc  now broadwing communications  with the operations of broadwing communications constituting the broadband segment 
the merger constituted a major strategic initiative for the company  which substantially increased the scope of the company s businesses

other income of million in increased million from the million loss recognized in  primarily due to the receipt of million of common shares as the result of the demutualization of anthem inc the income tax benefit of million represented a decrease in benefit of million as compared to the benefit of million 
this resulted primarily from a decrease in pretax losses of million and from the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state and local tax benefits due to uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of the benefits

excluding these nonrecurring items  the company reported a loss of per share in versus a loss of per share in compared to revenue consolidated revenue of  million in was million higher than the  million reported in  representing growth of 
in addition to the reasons noted in the segment discussions  this significant increase was primarily the result of the merger 
the year included a full year of the operating results of broadwing communications  whereas included its operating results prospectively from the november  date of the merger 
this affects nearly all aspects of the following discussion  with the exception of the local  wireless and other segments see detailed discussion of the operating results of these segments within the individual segment discussions that begin on page of this report on form k 
the pro forma results reflect an overall increase of or million over as growth of the broadband and wireless segments accounted for approximately of the incremental revenue 
costs and expenses costs of services and products were million in  a million  or increase in comparison to nearly all of this increase was attributable to the operations of the broadband segment  which resulted primarily from the merger 
the wireless and other segments incurred higher costs primarily for customer care  material costs associated with wireless handsets and promotional expenses required to launch new products and services 
the local segment incurred lower costs as a decrease in salaries and wages  postretirement and computer programming expenses were partially offset by an increase in customer care and materials and supplies relating to equipment sales 
on a pro forma basis  the increase in costs of services and products sold was or million as the higher costs in the wireless and other segments were offset slightly by reduced access and transmission fees resulting from less traffic being routed to competitors interexchange networks as the company expanded its own national optical network 
sg a expenses of million increased million  or  over the broadband segment incurred the majority of the increase  or million 
primarily as a result of the merger  the broadband segment incurred million of advertising expense in order to introduce the new broadwing brand and added more than employees to support the expanded network and sales function 
the wireless segment reported a million increase in sg a expense primarily for handset subsidies and selling expenses in response to significant growth in subscribership 
an increase of million was incurred by the other segment and resulted from initial costs associated with the introduction of the any distance offering and expansion of web hosting services 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in the sg a expenses of the local segment due to a reduction in advertising and headcount 
depreciation expense of million in increased million  or  over this increase was incurred primarily by the broadband segment as a result of the merger and reflects the continued build out of its national optical network 
the local and wireless segments also incurred higher depreciation expenses as both continued construction of their regional network infrastructures 
amortization expense of million pertains to purchased goodwill and other intangible assets and represented a million increase over  due almost exclusively to the merger 
the company recorded approximately million in net restructuring credits relating to the restructuring initiative that was undertaken in the fourth quarter of these credits consisted of million in additional severance expense  offset by a million reduction related to lease terminations 
operating income of million declined million versus the million reported in the operating income of the broadband segment decreased significantly as a result of the merger  while the other segment also experienced a drop in operating income due to the introduction of new products and services 
these decreases were partially offset by the improvement of the local and wireless segments 
on a pro forma basis  operating income increased from a loss of million to income of million as the company fully integrated the operations of the former ixc  increased revenue and controlled expenses 
minority interest expense of million in consists of million in dividends and accretion on the preferred stock of broadwing communications offset by approximately million that is attributable to aws s minority interest in the operating loss of the company s wireless business 
minority interest expense increased million from minority interest income of million in the increase is due to a full year of dividends and accretion on the preferred stock in versus only two months of dividends and accretion in  as the merger took place on november  the company recorded nearly million in losses in on the applied theory investment accounted for under the equity method  or approximately more than the million recorded in losses in were related to applied theory and a share of operating losses of ixc due to the company s ownership of ixc common stock from august  to the november  closing date of the merger 
these amounts are reported in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss under the caption equity loss in unconsolidated entities 
interest expense increased to million in  a or million increase over this was attributable to higher average debt levels necessary to fund expansion of the optical  wireless and local networks and higher interest rates 
in addition  the amounts reflect an entire year of interest expense related to the debt used to fund the merger  versus only two months of interest expense related to such debt in the company incurred a million loss on investments in this was the result of million in realized losses on the psinet  applied theory and zeroplus 
com investments  net of million in realized gains on the sale of the company s investment in purchasepro 
com 
no such losses were incurred in the income tax benefit of million increased million versus the million tax provision recorded in this resulted primarily from recognized losses on investments  somewhat offset by the effect of certain nondeductible expenses such as goodwill amortization and preferred stock dividends treated as minority interest expense 
the income tax provision for the period reflects an expense as operating losses generated by merger were included in results for only two months 
income from discontinued operations  comprising the operations of the company s former cincinnati bell supply cbs subsidiary  contributed an additional million in income net of tax in  or approximately million less than in  as the business was sold in may the company also recognized million in expense from a cumulative effect adjustment that resulted from the adoption of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as required by the securities and exchange commission on january  and all periods prior to adoption see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company reported a net loss of million as a result of the above  versus the million net income reported in dividends and accretion on preferred stock were million in  resulting in a net loss applicable to common shareholders of million 
the loss per share of was higher than in  but included a per common share loss pertaining to investments 
excluding investment losses  the adjusted loss per share of decreased in comparison to the income per share of in the decrease in both the net income and income per share is related to inclusion of a full year of results from broadwing communications versus only two months of results after the merger in on a pro forma basis  the net loss increased by or million as operating losses generated by the broadband segment in decreased in  but investment losses net of taxes incurred in grew by more than the operating loss declined 
discussion of operating segment results the following discussion of the operating results of the broadband segment is presented on an as reported basis except for information related to  which is presented on a pro forma basis because it represents the best basis for comparison of trends and operating results 
the local  wireless and other segments are discussed on an as reported basis since there is no distinction between pro forma and as reported results with respect to these segments 
broadband the broadband segment provides nationwide data and voice communications services through the company s broadwing communications subsidiary 
these services are provided over approximately  route miles of fiber optic transmission facilities 
broadband segment revenue is generated by broadband transport  switched voice services  data and internet services  information technology consulting it consulting and network construction and other services 
broadband transport services consist of long haul transmission of data  voice and internet traffic over dedicated circuits 
the majority of this revenue is generated by private line  monthly recurring revenues  however  approximately one fourth of the revenue is provided by iru agreements  which cover a fixed period of time and represent the lease of capacity or network fibers 
the buyer of iru services typically pays cash upon execution of the contract 
the company s policy and practice is to amortize these amounts into revenue over the life of the contract 
switched voice services consist of billed minutes of use  primarily for the transmission of voice long distance services on behalf of both wholesale and retail customers 
data and internet services consist of the sale of high speed data transport services utilizing technology based on internet protocol ip  atm frame relay  data collocation and web hosting 
it consulting consists of information technology consulting services and related hardware sales 
network construction and other services consists of large  joint use network construction projects  the receipt of warrants in related to a field trial of optical equipment and residual revenue in from a prior sale of dark fiber 
the broadband segment reflects the results of broadwing communications  which became a subsidiary of the company on november  as a result of the merger 
the operations of broadwing communications are included in the company s financial results prospectively from november  for purposes of comparability  the following discussion assumes the broadband segment existed in its current form effective january  and refers to pro forma results for as a result  the numbers referred to in this discussion for will be different from broadband segment amounts included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
the pro forma numbers also include the revenue and expenses associated with broadwing it consulting now operating as broadwing technology solutions and an agreement with the former cincinnati bell long distance to service its customers outside of the cincinnati  ohio area

nearly of the revenue growth came from it consulting while an additional came from the broadband transport line of business 
these increases more than offset a decline in switched voice services 
despite annual revenue growth in comparison to  results during the last two quarters of indicated a slowing of momentum  as revenue declined sequentially in both the third and fourth quarters 
in comparison to amounts  broadband transport revenue increased million in  growing to million 
approximately two thirds of the increase was driven by the renegotiation of iru contracts with one of the company s customers 
in order for these contracts to survive the customer s bankruptcy  the contracts were adjusted to reduce the services provided  update the operations and maintenance fees to a current market rate and shorten the lives of the agreements 
revenue also increased due to sales to new and existing customers  but the increases were partially offset by circuit disconnects during the second half of the year 
switched voice services revenue decreased for  from million to million 
this was the result of a continued focus on data services and accompanying deemphasis on sales of voice services to the lower end of the switched voice services customer base 
at the same time  the company made an effort to minimize sales to less creditworthy customers in the wake of increasing bankruptcies in the wholesale segment of this market 
the company expects switched voice services revenue to continue to decline in data and internet revenue increased million  or  as revenue continued to increase on the strength of demand for dedicated ip and atm frame relay services 
these increases were further supplemented by additional collocation revenue 
despite the growth in collocation revenue  the company s recently announced november restructuring plan included the closure of eight of the company s eleven data centers due to growth failing to meet expectations 
as a result  the company expects a year over year decrease of approximately million with regard to collocation revenue in it consulting revenue grew million  or  during of this growth  approximately million was attributable to increased sales of hardware  while the remaining growth was the result of increased sales of services 
network construction and other services revenue increased million  or  during as a result of a large  joint use construction project that is expected to be complete in the increase was partially offset by the nonrecurring receipt of warrants associated with a field trial of optical equipment in as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s november restructuring plan included plans to exit the network construction business upon completion of that large project 
accordingly  the company will treat the network construction business as a discontinued operation once its obligations are substantially complete  thereby reducing network construction and other services revenue in future reporting periods 
costs and expenses cost of services and products primarily reflects access charges paid to local exchange carriers and other providers  transmission lease payments to other carriers  costs incurred for network construction projects and personnel and hardware costs for it consulting 
in  cost of services and products amounted to million  a increase over the million incurred during these increases were driven primarily by incremental costs needed to support the revenue growth  as described above  in broadband transport  data and internet  information technology consulting services and network construction 
sg a expenses increased to million in increased employee expenses attributable to higher headcount during the first half of the year were almost entirely offset by lower advertising expenses and efforts to decrease consulting and contracted labor services 
ebitda increased in by nearly million  or  to million 
ebitda margin showed a modest increase of one point to 
compared to pro forma revenue revenue increased to reach billion in  with all revenue categories contributing to the million in growth 
more than half of this increase  or million  came from the broadband transport and data and internet categories 
the switched voice services category provided an additional million as a result of higher volumes  with an additional million in revenue growth resulting from it consulting and an increase in the number of network construction projects 
in  the broadband transport category contributed an additional million in revenue  increasing to million 
broadwing communications continued to experience increased demand for higher bandwidth services from its enterprise customers and benefited from higher iru revenue during switched voice services revenue increased by million  or  during  with million and million  respectively  in additional revenue being generated by the retail and wholesale components of this business 
switched wholesale voice revenue increased  as higher volumes resulting from the service agreement with cbad customers were further supplemented by an increase in international minutes carried 
switched retail voice revenue increased  as higher minutes of use were somewhat offset by a lower rate per minute 
the retail and wholesale components also benefited from improved credit management procedures  resulting in lower uncollectible revenue 
data and internet revenue increased or million in comparison to this revenue continued to grow on the strength of demand for internet based  atm frame relay  data collocation and web hosting services 
it consulting revenue increased from million in to nearly million in the increase was attributable to additional consulting revenue and related equipment sales 
network construction and other services revenue of million in was the result of two construction projects undertaken during the year and the receipt of warrants associated with a field trial of optical equipment 
the increase in revenue of million in this category was partially offset by nonrecurring  residual revenue from a prior sale of dark fiber in costs and expenses costs of services and products amounted to million in  a increase over these increases were driven primarily by revenue growth  but were held to a minimum due to a decreased reliance on transmission and access charges from other carriers as the company continued to expand and groom its own nationwide optical network 
these costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in  dropping four points to approximately of revenue 
sg a expenses were higher in  increasing  or million  to million 
this was primarily due to the addition of more than employees in support of new products and services and the it consulting business 
broadwing communications also incurred significant advertising expenditures in early in order to introduce the new broadwing brand 
of the million increase in advertising expense in  million was attributable to the initial nationwide advertising campaign that ran in the first quarter of additional advertising expenditures were incurred in support of new and existing products and services 
in the aggregate  sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by two percentage points to slightly less than

although the company expects to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in  capital expenditures and other investing needs will continue to drive the company s need for additional borrowings for a substantial portion of the year 
in order to provide for these cash requirements and other general corporate purposes  the company maintains a billion credit facility with a group of lending institutions 
the credit facility consists of million in revolving credit which matures in  million in term loans from banking institutions and million in term loans from nonbanking institutions 
at december   the company had drawn approximately billion from the credit facility in order to refinance its existing debt and debt assumed as part of the merger and to provide for the company s capital investment needs 
at december   the company had approximately million in additional borrowing availability from the revolving credit facility 
total availability under this credit facility will decrease throughout to approximately billion due to approximately million related to prepayment of the outstanding term debt facilities from the proceeds of the sale of cbd  million due to scheduled amortization of the term debt facilities and million due to scheduled amortization of the revolving credit facility 
the company believes that its borrowing availability will be sufficient to provide for its financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations during the short term debt on the balance sheet consisted of approximately million of principal payments  million of which was related to the credit facility and million of which was related to cbt bond payments due during the next twelve months 
the remaining balance of short term debt of million was related to the short term portion of capital leases 
the interest rates charged on borrowings from the credit facility can range from to basis points above the london interbank offering rate libor  and are currently between and basis points above libor as a result of the company s credit rating 
the company incurs banking fees in association with this credit facility that range from basis points to basis points  applied to the unused amount of borrowings of the facility

the company is also subject to financial covenants in association with the billion credit facility 
these financial covenants require that the company maintain certain debt to ebitda  debt to capitalization  senior secured debt to ebitda and interest coverage ratios 
this facility also contains certain covenants which  among other things  may restrict the company s ability to incur additional debt or liens  pay dividends  repurchase company common stock  sell  transfer  lease  or dispose of assets  make investments or merge with another company 
the company obtained an amendment to its credit facility to exclude the charges associated with the november restructuring plan from the covenant calculations 
the company is in compliance with all covenants set forth in its credit facility and other indentures

these downgrades will result in additional cash interest expense of basis points on up to billion of the company s billion credit facility  thereby increasing interest expense by million to million annually 
in the past  the credit facility was secured only by a pledge of the stock certificates of certain subsidiaries of the company 
upon the downgrades  the company became obligated to provide certain subsidiary guarantees and liens on the assets of the company and certain subsidiaries in addition to the stock certificates of the subsidiaries 
in order for the company to fully comply with these requirements  it may be necessary for the company and its subsidiaries to obtain various regulatory and other approvals 
if the company were unable to do so  it would likely seek to obtain waivers from its lenders 
if for these or any other reasons  the company were unable to comply with these obligations  it could be in default under its current facility  which would enable the lenders to terminate their commitments and accelerate their loans 
the company does not have any downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its debt 
however  further downgrades in the company s credit rating could adversely impact the cost of current and future debt facilities 
based on the balances of the company s outstanding long term debt as of december   a increase in the company s average borrowing rates would result in approximately million in incremental interest expense

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company uses a combination of variable rate short term and fixed rate long term financial instruments 
the company employs derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or enter into interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
for a more detailed discussion of the company s use of financial instruments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is  however  required by terms negotiated with its lenders to engage in interest rate swaps once certain thresholds are exceeded with regard to floating rate debt as a percentage of the company s total debt 
the company exceeded this threshold during and  accordingly  entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements on notional amounts totaling million 
the company continued to exceed the above noted threshold in  and therefore as of december   the company held interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million 
the purpose of these agreements is to hedge against changes in market interest rates to be charged on the company s borrowings under its credit facility 
the increase in the notional amount from to is a result of the company s additional borrowings under its credit facility during these swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties 
because these amounts are not exchanged  the notional amounts of these agreements are not indicative of the company s exposure resulting from these derivatives 
the amounts to be exchanged between the parties are primarily the result of the swap s notional amount and the fixed and floating rate percentages to be charged on the swap 
in accordance with sfas  interest rate differentials associated with the company s interest rate swaps are recorded as an adjustment to interest payable or receivable with the offset to interest expense over the life of the swap 
the swap agreements were a liability with a fair value of million recorded on the balance sheet as of december   and a million tax effected amount recorded in other comprehensive income 
as of december   the fair values of interest rate swaps were immaterial 
the increase in the liability related to interest rate swaps from to is due to the significant decline in interest rates throughout the company had fixed the interest rate on portions of its variable debt throughout as required by the terms of the credit facility 
as interest rates continued to fall  the fair value of the agreements entered into earlier in declined 
potential nonperformance by counterparties to the swap agreements exposes the company to a certain amount of credit risk due to the possibility of counterparty default
