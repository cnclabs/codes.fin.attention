overview applied innovation inc develops  manufactures  and markets network mediation and bridging products and related services to the telecommunications industry 
ai s products and services support the operation  maintenance  administration and provisioning of a variety of switching and transmission devices used by wireline and wireless telecommunications providers to assist in the management of their customer service networks 
ai s primary emphasis is on providing integrated hardware  software  service and turnkey network management solutions 
the company s largest customers are the four rbocs  other large domestic and foreign phone companies  and certain clecs 
through the aiswitch tm  aiscout tm  aiflex tm  aispy tm  and aibadger tm products  and the related appliedview tm  neweb tm  and aiwatch tm software  ai provides the data network needed to monitor and maintain thousands of pieces of electronic equipment used to deliver telecommunication services 
the company s services division combines a number of customer focused services  including network systems planning and design  systems integration  testing  installation  systems deployment and training 
in  the company announced the formation of luxpath networks  a new division focusing on broadband ethernet aggregation and transport products which provide high capacity  carrier quality fiber optic transmission solutions 
in  the company had its first sale and successful deployment of that division s flagship product  luxconnect tm 
also in  ai acquired certain assets of the remote network management systems and information collection device business of badger technology  inc badger 
the acquisition enables the company to target the wireless telecommunications market with its wireless network management and information collection products 
during the last twelve to eighteen months  the telecommunications industry has undergone a dramatic and severe slowdown 
telecommunications service providers have repeatedly reduced planned capital spending  have laid off workers  and some have gone into bankruptcy proceedings and or ceased operations 
the spending cutbacks have affected the company through reduced product orders  even by our largest and most financially secure rboc customers  and also started to negatively impact service sales in the second half of we cannot predict when this trend will reverse 
given the uncertainty regarding our customers near term spending plans and the effect on near term sales  the company has reduced its staffing level through two actions 
in june  the company reduced headcount by approximately personnel  or  and again in february  by approximately personnel  or 
the company believes that the cost savings associated with these staffing reductions  as well as other cost saving measures enacted  will more closely align the company s operating expenses with near term sales prospects 
we believe that in the long term  large domestic service providers will resume spending on network equipment and our product sales will increase 
despite the negative impact on domestic product sales in the near term  the company remains optimistic about domestic and international opportunities in the wireless market in further  as a result of our expanded international sales efforts over the last year  including establishing sales distributors and customer quotations and product trials  we expect international sales growth in we also expect growth in services sales  largely driven by network design  installation and maintenance of operating support system software 
comparison of to sales for the year ended december  were  a decrease from the prior year s sales of  excluding integration sales of  in and  in  which were almost entirely from one clec customer and were identified as non recurring in nature  annual sales would have been  and  in and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the non recurring revenue in both years  annual sales in decreased  or  from the prior year 
the decrease in non integration sales was due to reduced spending by clec customers throughout the year and reduced spending by larger service providers  including all of our rboc customers  in the second half of the year 
gross profit as a percentage of total sales was for the year ended december  as compared to in the prior year 
the overall increase in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to a change in the overall sales mix as integration sales  which carry a lower gross margin than products and services sales  represented of total sales in versus in the following table summarizes sales and gross profit for products  integration and services for the year ended december  for the year ended december  products integration services total products integration services total sales         gross profit         gross profit product sales of  were of total sales in  versus product sales of  or  of total sales in this represented a decrease in product sales in from  due largely to the industry wide reduction in capital spending  particularly in the second half of product sales comprised a larger percentage of total sales in as compared to because of the significant decrease in integration sales in product sales include revenues from the sales of aiswitch tm  aiscout tm  and other products  as well as software licensing revenues 
gross profit on product sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
product sales margins were generally consistent between years 
however  gross profit in was negatively impacted by inventory charges relating to the establishment of inventory reserves for optical and other component inventory 
due to long lead times and high market demand for optical components  the company placed orders in late and early for optical component inventory to support anticipated sales of luxconnect tm and other optical products 
given the continued uncertain market conditions for carriers deployment of new optical network capacity  as well as declining market prices for optical and other components  the company recorded inventory charges of  during to cover potential excess inventory and market price changes 
these amounts were charged to cost of goods sold 
the company will continue to monitor market conditions and market prices and additional reserves may be necessary in the future depending upon product demand and fluctuations in prices 
integration sales of  were of total sales in  compared to  or of total sales in the integration sales in and  consisting of turnkey integrated systems and including a significant amount of third party products integrated with the company s products  were attributable to the sale of an integrated solution to one large customer 
since the first quarter of  the company has had no additional integration sales 
gross profit on integration sales was for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
since the integration sales included a significant amount of third party equipment  the gross profit margin was significantly lower than margins on products or services sales 
gross profit in was higher than the prior year because integration sales included a higher proportion of ai equipment and labor which yields higher margins than third party equipment 
services sales of  were of total sales  versus services sales of  or of total sales 
this represented a increase in services sales from the increase in services sales was primarily attributed to the continued expansion of the company s installation services compared to the prior year for a number of customers  as well as project management services for one customer 
services sales include revenues from network planning and design  installation  project management  engineering services  training and maintenance 
gross profit on services sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit on service sales in was primarily attributable to a lower mix of maintenance revenues which generally have higher margins than revenues from other services  as well as decreased utilization of services personnel in the latter half of as overall spending in the telecommunications industry slowed 
because of the company s concentration of sales to rbocs  long distance phone companies  and large clecs  a small number of customers have historically comprised a substantial portion of the company s sales 
sales to four customers comprised of sales in  with each contributing between and of sales 
because of the direct correlation and relative importance of these significant customers capital spending patterns to the company  deviations from historical spending levels could significantly impact the company s future operating results 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of total sales  this represents in and in the increase in sg a spending was primarily attributable to increased staffing  additional personnel and costs associated with the badger acquisition  increased international travel and selling expenses and higher insurance costs 
in addition  sg a expenses as a percentage of total sales increased due to the decrease in integration sales in the current year as compared to the prior year 
as a result of staffing reductions in june and in february  the company anticipates that total sg a expenses for will be slightly lower than  but with certain specific increases anticipated as the company further pursues opportunities in the international and wireless markets 
research and development r d expenses were  in and  in as a percentage of total sales  this represents for and for the increase in r d expenses was primarily attributable to increased staffing costs to support product development associated with international and wireless opportunities 
the decrease in integration sales in as compared to also contributed to the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of total sales 
the company expects r d spending to decrease compared to however  the company continues to invest in the enhancement of existing products and development of new products to meet constantly changing customer and industry needs 
the company recorded a non recurring charge to operating expenses of  in the second quarter of to account for an approximate reduction in workforce  or approximately employees  throughout all departments 
this restructuring charge is separately stated on the consolidated statements of earnings and reflects estimated severance and fringe benefit costs associated with the termination of employees 
the company has paid out all such costs as of december  as a further response to the continued industry slowdown  the company initiated an additional reduction in workforce  or approximately employees  in the first quarter of again across all departments  the reduction in workforce resulted in restructuring charges of approximately  in that quarter for estimated severance and other personnel costs 
the company expects to pay out such costs through the remainder of as a result of the restructuring and other enacted cost reductions  the company anticipates reducing its annual costs by approximately  no additional workforce reductions or other cost reduction actions are currently planned  however the company will continue to monitor industry conditions and will take corrective action as industry conditions change 
as a result of the above factors  income from operations decreased to  in from  in income from operations represented of sales in  compared to of sales in income before income taxes in was  or of sales  compared to  or in the company s effective income tax rate was in compared to in the decrease in the effective income tax rate in was due primarily to research and experimentation credits 
the credits had a more significant impact on the effective income tax rate in because of decreased income before income taxes in as compared to net income was  or diluted earnings per share  in versus net income of  or diluted earnings per share  in the diluted weighted average number of shares was  for compared to  for primarily due to the impact of the high volume of digital subscriber line dsl systems integration work being performed late in the year ended december   several balance sheet accounts changed significantly between december  and december  the volume of such dsl systems integration work declined significantly during the first quarter of  and was non existent during the remainder of as a result  net inventory decreased from  at december   to  at december   while accounts payable decreased from  to  these decreases are due to the high volume of dsl equipment inventory and associated trade payables used to support a large systems integration project for one customer in the second half of net accounts receivable decreased from  at december  to  at december   partially due to a decrease of  for the same dsl systems integration customer 
in addition  accounts receivable at december  included significant amounts related to software and annual maintenance agreements which were invoiced in december and which did not exist at december  due primarily to timing of the agreements and related invoices and payments 
the december  consolidated balance sheet also includes goodwill of  and net intangible assets of  as a result of the badger acquisition in comparison of to sales for the year ended december  were  a increase from the prior year s sales of  strong demand for the company s integration and services business  including integrated digital subscriber line solutions  accounted for approximately  of the increase 
additionally  higher demand for the company s aiscout tm  aiswitch tm  and ai products accounted for approximately  of the increase 
because of the company s concentration of sales to rbocs  long distance phone companies  and large clecs  a small number of customers have historically represented substantial portions of ai s sales 
two companies accounted for of net sales in these two customers contributed and of sales  respectively 
the following table summarizes sales and gross profit for products  integration and services for the year ended december  for the year ended december  products integration services total products integration services total sales        gross profit        gross profit product sales of  were of total sales in  versus product sales of  or  of total sales in this represented a increase in product sales from the year to the year product sales include revenues from the sales of aiswitch tm  aiscout tm  and other products  as well as software licensing revenues from neweb tm and appliedview tm 
integration revenues were  or of total sales in  and were substantially all from one customer 
there were no such sales in prior years 
integration revenue consists of turnkey integrated systems and includes a significant amount of third party products integrated with the company s products 
services revenues of  were of sales  versus services revenues of  or of sales 
this represented a increase in services revenues from the prior year 
services revenues consist of project management  installation and other services for our customers 
gross profit  as a percentage of total sales  was in  compared to in gross profit on product sales was in  compared with in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of product sales was primarily attributable to a higher sales mix of products that have slightly lower gross margins  such as the aiscout tm  the ai and the appliedview tm systems hardware support equipment 
gross profit on services sales was in  compared to in integration gross profit as a percentage of integration sales was 
the percentage was significantly lower than the gross profit percentage achieved on products and services due to the large amount of third party equipment costs 
sg a expenses increased to  of sales in from  of sales in the increase in sg a spending was primarily attributable to new sales  sales engineering and senior management positions  increased expenditures for the integration and services division  and higher marketing expenditures 
r d expenses increased to  of sales in from  of sales in this was a result of additional staffing and expenditures on new product initiatives  including luxpath networks fiber optic products 
as a result of the above changes in sales and expenses  income from operations increased to  from  in income from operations represented of sales in  compared to of sales in other income  which consists primarily of interest income on the company s investments  increased to  in  versus  in  due to a higher average investment balance in income before income taxes in was  compared to  in the effective income tax rate was in compared to in net income was  or diluted earnings per share in versus net income of  or diluted earnings per share in the diluted weighted average number of shares was  for compared to  for liquidity and capital resources the company had  of cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments at december  compared to  at december  during  operating activities provided cash of  cash flow from operations resulted from net income  adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash adjustments related primarily to depreciation expense  provision for doubtful accounts and the tax benefit associated with stock option exercises 
changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from significant decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
those balance sheet changes were attributable to the significant dsl systems integration project that was in process at the end of and completed in investing activities in used  in cash  including  for equipment purchases to support operations   related to the badger acquisition and  for investment securities purchases net of maturities and sales 
additionally  financing activities used  of cash in  including  to repurchase common stock  partially offset by  of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
net working capital was  at december  compared to  at december  at december   the current ratio was and the company s only debt outstanding was a  note payable issued in conjunction with the badger acquisition 
the note payable bears interest at an annual rate of  with interest payments due semi annually and principal due at maturity in august on september   the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the company may purchase up to  shares of common stock over the next twelve months 
as of december    shares had been repurchased under this program at an average price of per share  for an aggregate price of  at the april  annual meeting of stockholders  the amended and restated certificate of incorporation was approved and adopted which increased the number of authorized shares of the company s common stock  
par value  from  to  shares and which authorized the issuance of  shares of preferred stock  
par value 
at december   the company had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents  investments and cash to be generated from future operations will provide sufficient capital to meet the business needs of the company through the end of however  if the company s working capital needs significantly increase due to circumstances such as sustained weakness in the telecommunications industry resulting in decreased demand for the company s products and services and operating losses  or alternatively  faster than expected growth resulting in increased accounts receivable and inventory  significant stock repurchase activity  additional acquisition activity  or significant research and development efforts  the company may seek to fund these requirements through a line of credit  other debt  issuance of additional equity or sale of land 
critical accounting policies the company applies certain accounting policies which are critical in understanding the company s results of operations and the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
because these policies require judgment and involve choices among alternatives  reported results could vary materially if different assumptions or policies were utilized 
critical accounting policies include revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized on product and integration sales as products are delivered and ownership and risk of loss are transferred 
in certain situations  customers may request that products are built and prepared for shipment but held temporarily by the company on the customer s behalf 
in those instances  revenue is recognized when all other terms and obligations of the sale are met  including transfer of ownership and risk of loss 
the company also derives revenue from the sale of internally developed software and related maintenance and support agreements 
basic revenue recognition criteria related to software sales include the following four elements persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the related fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
software license fees are generally recognized when the software product has been delivered  which is generally the point at which all four criteria have been met 
revenue associated with software maintenance and support agreements is recognized straight line over the term of the related agreement 
the company also generates revenue from the activities of its services division 
field service projects are typically short term projects which are billed and accepted by the customer on a project by project basis  with revenue recognized upon project completion 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized straight line over the related maintenance period 
sales return allowances other than issues involving warranty claims  customers generally do not have the right to return products 
however  in certain limited circumstances as defined in contracts  customers are permitted to return products 
the company establishes a sales return allowance reflecting its estimate of such product returns 
the estimate is based on a number of factors  including the contract provisions  the company s understanding of each customer s forecasted usage of previously purchased products and the estimated likelihood that customers will return products 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company provides its customers with credit on purchases  generally requiring payment within thirty days from delivery 
since the company s customer base is generally comprised of very large  well funded service providers  the company s historical credit risk has been very low 
however  the company does establish allowances against accounts receivable for potentially uncollectible amounts 
the company estimates the necessary allowance based on an analysis of customers past payment practices and any known factors concerning their current financial condition 
to the extent any customers unexpectedly become insolvent or unable to pay amounts due  the allowance estimates may be incorrect 
over the last twelve months  many telecommunications service providers  including some that have historically been customers of the company  have experienced financial challenges 
the company did not have any significant exposure to bankruptcies among our customers 
further  the company has not historically provided vendor financing to its customers  and currently has no plans to do so 
inventory the company records inventory utilizing standard costs  which approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
additionally  the company carries inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company periodically estimates its necessary reserve for inventory obsolescence to ensure inventory balances are properly stated 
such estimates are based on inventory quantities on hand  sales forecasts for particular products  overall industry trends that may affect individual product lines  as well as fluctuations in component prices from suppliers 
in  the company recorded  of inventory charges  primarily related to weaker than expected demand for optical products 
continued weak demand and falling component prices for optical transmission products could impact the valuation of the company s optical inventory 
likewise  decreases in component part prices for the company s general inventory could impact inventory valuations 
intangible assets and goodwill the company has certain intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions which are recorded at cost 
these intangible assets are amortized straight line over their respective estimated economic lives  generally up to three years  and reviewed for impairment under certain circumstances 
goodwill  representing the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  is not subject to periodic amortization but is also periodically reviewed for impairment 
warranty the company generally warrants its products for one year  with negotiated warranties available up to five years 
based primarily on historical experience  the company estimates its expected future warranty costs and accrues such costs at the time of sale 
warranty costs generally consist of labor and materials to repair defective parts  replacement parts  shipping costs to replace materials  and labor and travel costs associated with customer site visits to repair products or correct prior service work 
the company s overall warranty costs have been decreasing over the past several years  primarily due to improved product quality 
however  as the company introduces new products using new technology or if defects are found in widely distributed products  such costs could increase in the future 
income taxes the company utilizes the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and respective tax bases 
the company s provision for income taxes involves estimates of taxable income for federal  state and local purposes in various taxing jurisdictions as well as estimated research and experimentation credits  which could be subject to change in the event of an audit by the internal revenue service 
stock based compensation under various stock option plans  the company has issued stock options to employees and members of the company s board of directors 
the company applies the intrinsic value based method of accounting for its fixed plan stock options and therefore must record compensation expense for any options granted with an exercise price less than the current market price at the date of grant 
because the company has not granted any options with exercise prices less than market prices at the date of grant  the company has not recorded any compensation expense in its consolidated statements of earnings 
had the company utilized a fair value based method of accounting for its stock options rather than an intrinsic value based method  the company would have recognized additional compensation expense  net of related tax effects  of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition to the above critical accounting policies  the company utilizes certain estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
because these estimates are inherently subjective and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as contingent assets and liabilities  different estimates would yield different results as reported in the consolidated financial statements 
areas that involve utilization of significant estimates include accounting for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence  estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  depreciation and amortization  sales returns  warranty costs  income taxes and contingencies 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company is obligated over the next two years for office space and office equipment under various operating leases 
future minimum lease payments under these leases are  in and  in the company s note payable of  is due in august also  related to the badger acquisition  the company may make contingent payments of up to  based on certain product sales over the next two years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement will also require that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
because the company had not consummated any business combinations prior to its acquisition of badger s remote network management systems and information collection device business on august   these pronouncements have no impact on any prior business combinations 
in accordance with these pronouncements  the badger acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisition are being amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and will be reviewed for impairment  while goodwill is not being amortized but will instead be tested for impairment  as prescribed by the pronouncements 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both statement and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  which relates to the disposal of a segment of a business 
statement retains the fundamental provisions in statement for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with statement the company is required to adopt statement no later than the year beginning after december   and plans to adopt its provisions for the quarter ending march  management does not expect the adoption of statement for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the company s financial statements because the impairment assessment under statement is largely unchanged from statement the provisions of statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities
