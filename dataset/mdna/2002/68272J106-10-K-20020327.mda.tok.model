table of contents overview onesource provides primarily web based business and financial information products to professionals who need quick access to timely and reliable company  industry  and market intelligence 
onesource was formed as a division of lotus development corporation in and became an independent company when it was purchased in a management buy out in until december  onesource s business was to provide business information to the financial community using cd rom technology as the primary method of distribution 
the introduction of the business browser product line in december marked a fundamental shift in the business as onesource began a transition away from its legacy cd rom business and toward web based products 
the onesource business browser product line is designed to be a comprehensive and easy to use business and financial information resource  integrating over  sources of business information from more than business and financial information providers and onesource s own corptech high technology company database 
the onesource product line also includes the applink application programming interface toolkit 
the applink application programming interface toolkit lets business browser customers access business browser content from within their own internal applications 
these applications may be internally developed or utilize third party software  and typically apply to corporate intranets  portals  or customer relationship platforms 
on october   onesource acquired corporate technology information services  inc  a delaware corporation located in woburn  massachusetts 
corporate technology information services  inc is a provider of high technology company profiles with a focus on emerging private companies 
pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  the consideration paid by onesource was million in cash 
for financial statement purposes  this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of operations of corporate technology information services  inc subsequent to october  have been included in onesource s consolidated statements of operations 
in may  onesource sold its cd insurance division to allow onesource to focus more completely on its new web based product line 
onesource recognized a gain of million on this sale during in addition  in connection with the disposition  onesource licensed certain of its cd rom software to the acquiror in exchange for million of license fees 
these license fees were paid in eight equal quarterly installments beginning january  and ending on december  and were recognized ratably as other income 
for each of the years ended december  and december   onesource recorded million of other income related to the software license agreement 
revenues from both cd rom and web based products consist of monthly subscription fees from customer contracts 
customer contracts span varying periods of time but are generally for one year  are renewable for like periods  and are payable in advance 
subscription fees generally are quoted to clients on an annual basis but are earned as revenues on a monthly basis over the subscription period 
invoices are recorded as accounts receivable until paid and as deferred revenues until earned 
deferred revenues attributable to web based products decreased to million as of december  from million as of december  and increased from million as of december  cost of revenues consists primarily of royalties to information providers and  to a lesser extent  employee salaries and benefits  facilities allocation and related expenses  depreciation associated with computers for data processing and on line requirements and web hosting expenses 
onesource enters into contracts with information providers  which are generally for a term of at least one year and are automatically renewable if not canceled with advance notice 
these contracts may be terminated under certain circumstances 
under these agreements  royalties are generally paid on a quarterly basis to information providers 
royalties are generally calculated either as a flat percentage of our revenues  as a per user fee that declines as the number of authorized users of the product increases  as a fixed fee per period  or in some cases  we pay a calculated fee based upon product growth compared to like periods from the prior year 
royalties are recorded as deferred subscription costs and are expensed as revenues are earned over the term of the contract period 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits and sales commissions paid to our sales force  customer support organization  and marketing personnel  as well as facilities allocation and related expenses  direct marketing promotional materials  trade show exhibitions and advertising 
sales commissions are paid when customers are invoiced and are recorded as deferred subscription costs  which are amortized ratably over the term of the contract  typically months  as the associated revenues are recognized 
all other selling and marketing costs are expensed as incurred 

table of contents platform and product development expense consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits  facilities allocation and related expenses  as well as outside contractor expenses  relating to the development of our platform of core software supporting our products and the development of new products based upon that platform 
platform and product development expense includes expenses relating to the editorial staff that implements our keyid taxonomy to integrate disparate information sources into our web based products 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits  facilities allocation and related expenses associated with onesource s management  finance  purchasing  human resources  legal  management information systems  and administrative groups 
critical accounting policies  significant judgements and estimates onesource s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon onesource s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires onesource to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  onesource evaluates its estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
onesource believes the following accounting policies are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results  as well as the areas of more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
onesource s products are sold on a subscription basis pursuant to customer contracts that span varying periods of time but are generally for a period of one year 
onesource initially records receivables and defers the related revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are recognized ratably over the related subscription period beginning when access to products is granted to the customer in accordance with customer agreements 
this policy significantly reduces subjectivity in determining the timing of revenue recognition 
software development costs 
platform and product development costs  other than certain software development costs  are charged to expense as incurred 
onesource has adopted statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which requires research and development costs associated with the application development stage to be capitalized for internal use software 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria in sop for immediate expense or capitalization 
management periodically reviews the carrying value of the projects that have been capitalized to determine if impairment may exist 
if it is determined that the carrying value of the asset has been impaired  the value would be reduced by a charge to operations in the amount of the impairment 
deferred subscription costs 
deferred subscription costs represent sales commission and royalty costs that are associated with securing a subscription and procuring information to be delivered over the subscription period  respectively 
these costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the associated subscription period as a component of selling and marketing expense and cost of revenues  respectively 
if a contract relating to the procurement of information used in our product was terminated prematurely  for any reason  expense recognition may be accelerated and incurred sooner than originally anticipated 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
onesource assesses collectibility of accounts receivable based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  past transactions history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
onesource does not request collateral from its customers 
onesource maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of onesource s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of goodwill  trademark  non compete agreement  subscriber list  and a database 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over a period of three to seven years  based on the estimated useful life 
the carrying value of the intangible assets is reviewed on a quarterly basis for the existence of facts or circumstances both internally and externally that may suggest impairment 
onesource determines whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash 
table of contents flows and measures the amount of the impairment based on the related future estimated discounted cash flows 
to date  no such impairment has occurred 
factors which we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company will cease amortization of goodwill as of january  and  thereafter  will annually review the goodwill for potential impairment using a fair value approach 
income tax 
onesource records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   onesource has provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of its net deferred tax asset 
while onesource has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event onesource were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made

this is a measurement onesource uses for normalized period to period comparisons to indicate business volume and growth  both in terms of new customers and upgrades and expansions at existing customers 
onesource s presentation and calculation of annualized contract value may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other 
table of contents companies 
it is not an absolute indicator  and onesource cannot guarantee that any annualized contract value will be ultimately realized as revenues 
onesource uses annualized contract value as a measure of its business because it shows the growth or decline in onesource s customer base in a way that revenues cannot 
since onesource s business is primarily subscription based  revenues are recognized not when a sale is made  but in ratable portions over the term of the subscription which is usually twelve months 
as a result  from a revenue viewpoint the addition or loss of even a major customer contract may not have a dramatic impact on a quarter to quarter basis 
on the other hand  by looking at the value of customer contracts in hand at the end of each quarter  onesource can more readily see trends in its business 
for example  the addition of a one year subscription contract with total payments of million may only increase revenues by approximately  million divided by four in the quarter in which the sale is made  but would increase annualized contract value by million 
similarly  if the customer did not renew that contract  revenues in the next quarter would only decrease by  while annualized contract value would decrease by million 
in calculating annualized contract value  onesource factors only those contracts for which the customer has actually been invoiced 
since amounts invoiced are included in deferred revenues on onesource s balance sheet for all customer contracts with terms extending beyond the month of invoice  this demonstrates that annualized contract value is based on actual customer contracts reflected in onesource s historical financial statements 
to compute annualized contract value  one multiplies by twelve the amount of total invoiced fees for one month that are included in deferred revenues 
annualized contract value is not intended to be an absolute indicator of future revenues 
onesource only annualizes existing  invoiced contracts  but does so without regard to the remaining term of those contracts 
most of onesource s contracts are for months  but as of the date that onesource calculates annualized contract value  the remaining term of nearly all of onesource s contracts will be less than months 
if a customer fails to pay its invoiced fees or terminates the contract or if onesource is unable to renew a contract  its revenues in subsequent periods may be less than expected if based solely on annualized contract value 
conversely  if onesource adds additional customers or renews existing contracts at higher rates  its revenues in future periods may exceed expectations if based solely on annualized contract value 
the calculation of annualized contract value for onesource s web based products is illustrated below one month of web based invoiced fees deferred in deferred annualized measurement date revenues revenues contract value in thousands december  december  the aggregate annualized contract value for web based products was million as of december   compared to million as of december   representing a decrease in annualized contract value of 
of this million  million was attributable to those customers that were under contract as of both december  and the renewal rate for subscribers of the business browser product line as of december  was calculated on a dollar basis  whereas the renewal rate for those subscribers that also use the applink application programming interface tool as of december  was calculated on a dollar basis 
the number of web based customers decreased to at december  from at december  on average  onesource s customers for web based products as of december  had an annualized contract value of  per customer  compared to an average annualized contract value of  per customer as of december   which represents a increase 
onesource believes this growth in average annualized contract value was attributable to an increase in the number of user licenses purchased by individual customers and the addition of new products subscribed to by individual customers 
as of december   organizations subscribed to the applink application programming interface toolkit 
such customers as of december  generated  on average  approximately  each in annualized contract value 
liquidity and capital resources since acquiring the business from lotus development corporation in  onesource has funded operations through a combination of seller financing  proceeds received from the sale of class p common stock

net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the net change of million period to period is the result of increased net income of million in compared to net income of million in  partially offset by changes in assets and liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was primarily from purchases of property and equipment for million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december   as well as million for capitalized software development costs for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities in primarily consisted of the repurchase of common stock of million  offset in part by net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our various stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily consisted of net proceeds from the sale of common stock under various stock option and employee stock purchase plans  offset in part by repayments of capital lease obligations 
onesource does not currently have a line of credit but intends to enter into a revolving line of credit for letters of credit  equipment financing  and general working capital 
onesource believes that its current cash and cash equivalents and funds anticipated to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in april  onesource announced a stock buyback program to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock over the next twelve months  at such times when onesource deems such purchases to be an effective use of cash 
under the stock repurchase program  shares may be repurchased from time to time  at management s discretion  at prevailing prices in the open market 
as of december   onesource had repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share 
onesource intends to leverage its existing cash and cash equivalents balances to execute the repurchases 
in january  onesource announced a second stock buyback program to repurchase up to an additional million of its common stock over the next twelve months

certain factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
onesource s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including without limitation  those set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating onesource and its business we have a cumulative deficit and expect to continue to have a cumulative deficit for the foreseeable future 
we incurred losses from operations of approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in  and had net income from operations of million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we rely on generating subscription revenues from our business browser product line  and we may not sustain or increase profits unless demand for our business browser products continues to grow 
subscription revenues from our business browser product line accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in  of total revenues in  of total revenues in  and of total revenues in at the end of  we phased out our legacy cd rom products that were not part of the business browser product line 
as a result  our future financial condition may depend heavily on the success or failure of our business browser product line 
business browser products were introduced in december  and it is difficult to predict demand and market acceptance for these products in the new and rapidly evolving web based business information services market 
if the demand for business browser products does not continue to grow  whether due to  among other factors  increased competition  lack of market acceptance  insufficient enhancements  failure of internet or web use to grow in general  or technological change  we may not be able to sustain or increase profits 
our sales efforts to our target market may be lengthy  involve delays  or involve uncertainty  all of which may adversely impact our results of operations 
selling our products to our target market  global business to business companies  involves sales cycles that we believe are potentially longer and more uncertain than those involving small size organizations 
our customers generally commit significant time and resources to evaluate our products  and they often require us to expend substantial time  effort  and money to educate them about our products and solutions 
in addition  these sales efforts often require final approval from our customers senior level management  potentially resulting in delays to the sales cycle 
all of these factors may extend the sales 
table of contents cycle and increase the uncertainty of whether a sale will actually be completed 
the timing and uncertainty of sales and the length of the sales cycle may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
annualized contract value may not be an accurate indication of our performance 
we use annualized contract value as a measurement for normalized period to period comparisons to indicate business volume and growth 
our presentation and calculation of annualized contract value may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
it is not an absolute indicator  and we cannot guarantee that any annualized contract value will be ultimately realized as revenues 
competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do  this competition may adversely affect our financial results 
the business information services industry is intensely competitive 
several of our information providers compete against each other and in some cases with us 
we face direct or indirect competition from numerous companies including the following large  well established business and financial information providers such as dow jones co  pearson plc  reuters group plc  and mcgraw hill companies inc  aggregators of business and financial information  such as lexisnexis  the dialog corporation  factiva  newsedge corporation  and bureau van dijk computer services sa  providers of company information  such as disclosure incorporated  market guide inc a multex 
com subsidiary  hemscott group ltd  and hoovers  inc  providers of sales  marketing  and credit information such as dun bradstreet corp  infousa inc  and siebel systems  inc  and web retrieval  web portal companies  and other free or low cost mass market on line services  such as terranetworks  sa  yahoo inc  aol time warner  inc  marketwatch

based on reported operating results  industry reports and other publicly available information  we believe that many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of prospective competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we possess 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in user requirements  or to devote greater resources to the research  development  promotion  and sale of their products than we can 
these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and make more attractive offers to potential employees  customers  and information providers 
our competitors also may develop products that are equal or superior to our products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products 
ultimately  we may lose customers to competitors if we are not able to respond to requests for additional features and new products in a timely fashion 
nonetheless  increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins  or loss of market share  any of which may materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our failure to increase the number of our subscribers or retain our current subscriber base may adversely affect our business 
our future success remains highly dependent on attracting organizations that are financially able to and willing to allocate funds to subscribe to on line business information services 
if the market for subscription based on line business information services develops more slowly than we may anticipate  or if our efforts to retain existing subscribers or attract new subscribers are not successful or cost effective  our operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
if a significant number of our customers experience a decline in their financial condition  the collectability of our accounts receivable may suffer  and may materially adversely affect our financial results 
a decline in the financial condition of additional customers owing significant amounts to us may cause us to write off the amounts owed by these customers as bad debt  and or a revenue reduction  either of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
expansion into international markets where we have limited prior experience may cause material and adverse effects on our business 
we 
table of contents presently have offices primarily in the us and in the united kingdom  but look to expand our business opportunities into new markets 
expanding into diverse international markets exposes us to certain risks of conducting business that include  but are not limited to  the following potential higher costs  unanticipated regulatory changes  political instability  difficulties in staffing and managing operations  adverse tax consequences  currency and exchange rate fluctuations  and seasonal reductions in business activity 
in addition  the impact of language and other cultural differences could result in product and service offerings that may not satisfy the needs of our customers and may not be profitable 
further  strategic relationships may be necessary to facilitate expansion into certain markets  and our business may be adversely affected if we misallocate our resources and ultimately fail to gain new or effective alliances in these areas 
moreover  possible nationalization  expropriation  and limits and unique laws pertaining to the collection and provision of certain types of information on individuals eg  the data protection act may hinder operations in international markets  and may cause material and adverse effects on our business 
general economic and geopolitical conditions may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
an ongoing economic downturn and uncertain geopolitical environment may cause organizations to delay or forego entirely investments in value added business information products such as the business browser product line and applink application programming interface toolkit 
we have experienced these effects in the last year as a result of the recent economic slowdown and the tragic events occurring on september  a prolonged recession and geopolitical crisis may cause organizations that comprise our target market to significantly reduce discretionary spending with business information providers and create a greater risk of business failure among existing subscribers 
these effects may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if our information providers provide us with inaccurate or unreliable data  fail to transmit their data feeds  cease doing business with us  or require us to significantly increase our royalty obligations  this may have an adverse effect on our business  and future sales of the business browser product may be jeopardized 
we do not own or create all of the original content distributed through our products 
we depend significantly on information providers to supply accurate and reliable information and data feeds to us on a timely basis 
our products may experience interruptions and potentially may be compromised due to any failure  delay  or cut off in the transmission or receipt of this information  or a requirement by our information providers that royalty payments be significantly increased 
in addition  our products may be negatively affected if our information providers provide us with faulty or erroneous data that becomes integrated into our products 
we may then have to seek alternatives to the information providers information and data feeds  and  in some cases  it is possible that reasonable alternatives may not exist without resorting to multiple sources  or may not be provided in a timely manner 
this may result in increased costs or reduced functionality of our products and may have a material and adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if our third party hosting facility suffered a disaster  it may be costly to correct  and our business may suffer significant losses 
our third party hosting facility may suffer a disaster relating to the facility  its power supplies  or telecommunications transports 
defects  errors  or a disaster at our third party hosting facility also may result in significant downtime  and our business may suffer significantly from potential adverse customer reaction  litigation  negative publicity  loss of revenues  and harm to our reputation 
if our software or hardware becomes defective  or if our software  hardware  or web site becomes the target of intentional disruptions  directly or indirectly  our products may be negatively impacted  and our reputation and future sales may be harmed if these efforts are successful 
complex software like the software we develop and use and the hardware we use for our products may contain or develop errors or defects  especially when first implemented  that may be very difficult and costly to correct 
in addition  our software  hardware  or web site may become the target of intentional disruptions  directly or indirectly  including software viruses and malicious code specifically designed to impede the performance of our products  such software viruses and malicious code may avoid detection by our anti virus software in place 
similarly  experienced computer programmers or hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions to the delivery of our products 
as a result  our activities may be substantially disrupted  and our reputation  future sales  operating results  and financial condition may be adversely affected if these efforts are successful 

table of contents we may have difficulty identifying and competing for acquisition opportunities 
our business strategy includes the pursuit of strategic acquisitions 
from time to time we may engage in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of niche expertise  business  and or proprietary rights 
in executing our acquisition strategy  we may be unable to identify suitable companies as acquisition candidates 
in addition  if we pursue an acquisition and are unable to identify a suitable acquisition candidate  management may potentially spend a significant amount of time  energy  and resources that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
pursuing and completing potential acquisitions may divert management attention and financial resources and may not produce the desired business results 
if we pursue and complete any potential acquisition s  our management team may spend a significant amount of time and management and financial resources in the acquisition process and to integrate the acquired business with our existing business 
to pay for acquisition s  we may use capital stock  cash  or a combination of both 
alternatively  we may borrow money from a bank or other lender 
if we use cash or debt financing  our financial liquidity will be reduced 
in addition  from an accounting perspective  the potential acquisition s may involve nonrecurring charges or involve amortization of significant amounts of goodwill that may adversely affect our results of operations 
despite the investment of these management and financial resources and completion of due diligence with respect to these efforts  the potential acquisition s may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we may anticipate  and the acquired technology or proprietary right s may not perform as expected for a variety of reasons  including the following difficulty in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  rights  products  and personnel of the acquired business es  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired business es  potential dilution to current shareholders from the issuance of additional equity securities  expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired business es  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business es 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results  which may make it difficult for investors to perform reliable period to period comparisons  and contribute to volatility in the market price for our common stock  thus potentially reducing investment in our stock 
our quarterly revenues  gross profits  and results of operations may fluctuate in the future 
in addition  we believe that an important measure of our business is the annualized contract value at the end of each period  which also may fluctuate 
causes of such fluctuations have included and may include  among other factors  as follows changes in demand for our products and services  the size  value and timing of both new and renewal subscriptions with our corporate customers  the cost and renewal status of contracts with our content providers  competition particularly price  product and service competition  increases in selling and marketing expenses  as well as other operating expenses  technical difficulties or system downtime affecting our products or the web generally  overall performance of our products  services  and technology  our ability to develop  market  and introduce new and enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis  economic conditions specific to the web  as well as general economic and political conditions  and consolidation of our customers 
further  a substantial portion of our expenses  including most product and platform development and selling and marketing expenses  must be incurred in advance of revenue generation 
if we are unable to expand 
table of contents our sales and marketing efforts and our projected revenues do not meet our expectations  then we are likely to experience an even larger shortfall in our operating profit loss relative to our expectations 
moreover  although we are not presently a party to a lawsuit  any potential claims  even if not meritorious  against us may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on our part  which may contribute to a decrease in investment of our stock and may materially impact our results of operations by potentially subjecting us to significant liabilities and by diverting management s attention and resources 
we may be subject to potential litigation by any third party concerning the infringement of any proprietary right  and such litigation may be costly and time consuming 
in addition  we may have to incur legal expenses to protect our intellectual property rights 
there has been substantial litigation in the information services industry involving intellectual property rights 
although we believe that we have not infringed  and are not infringing  the intellectual property of others through our business browser product line  applink application programming interface toolkit  and cd rom product  if such claims were to be asserted  with or without merit  they may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  to the extent that we license from third parties informational content that is included in our business browser product line  our potential exposure to copyright infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon warranties and representations by such information providers as to the origin and ownership of content that we are subsequently licensing to users of our business browser products  such warranties and representations that may be inaccurate or inadequate 
in addition  although we generally obtain indemnification provisions in our agreements with information providers  indemnification may not be adequate compensation for breach of such warranties and representations 
in the event of a successful claim against us  we may be required to pay significant monetary damages if we are held to have willfully infringed a patent  copyright  trade secret  or other proprietary right  discontinue use or sale of the infringing products or information  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  and or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that may not be offered on acceptable terms 
if a successful claim is filed against us and we fail to commercially develop or license a substitute technology  our business may be materially harmed 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to defend  enforce  and or protect our own intellectual property  including our copyrights  patents  trademarks  and other proprietary information 
the protective steps we have taken and continue to take may be inadequate to deter misappropriations of our intellectual property rights  and we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights 
any litigation involving intellectual property rights may be costly and time consuming  and divert management s attention  either of which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
adverse determinations in this litigation may result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from additional third parties  cause our customers to prematurely cancel their subscriptions to our products  and prevent us from selling our products  any one of these results may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
additionally  our general liability insurance may not cover any of these claims or may not be adequate to protect us against all liability that may be imposed 
further  effective protection of intellectual property rights is limited or unavailable in certain foreign countries  thus making the possibility of misappropriation of our intellectual property more likely 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  expensive  and time consuming  and the unique technology of the internet may provide new methods for illegal copying and distribution 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we may be able to protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized third party copying  distribution  or use 
this may materially and adversely affect our competitive position 
if we lose key personnel and are unable to attract additional and retain existing key personnel  it may cause a material and adverse effect on our business 
we expect that our future success will depend  in substantial part  on the continued services of our senior management  including daniel j 
schimmel  our president and chief executive officer  william g 
schumacher  our senior vice president  content development  philip j 
garlick  our senior vice president  global sales  roy d 
landon  our senior vice president and chief financial officer  michael buzzell  our senior vice president  engineering  and mary f 
mccabe  our senior vice president  product development 
none of our senior management has entered into employment agreements with us  and we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of one or a group of our key personnel may have a material  adverse effect on development of new 
table of contents products and services  our ability to manage the business  and our financial condition 
in addition  we expect that our future success will depend on our continuing ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly qualified technical  customer support  sales  financial  accounting  and managerial personnel 
competition for such key personnel is intense  and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain such personnel or that we will be able to attract  assimilate  or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
moreover  competition for highly qualified key personnel may lead to increased recruitment and retention costs  thus potentially hindering our financial condition 
the future sales of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price  which may cause difficulties in the future to sell equity 
if our stockholders decide to sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding options in the public market  the market price of our common stock may decrease 
such potential sales may make it increasingly difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable and appropriate 
if we are unable to maintain our reputation and expand our name recognition  we may have difficulty attracting new business and retaining our current customer base and employees  and our business may suffer 
establishing and maintaining a solid reputation and name recognition are critical for attracting and retaining customers as well as employees 
the importance of reputation and name recognition is increasing and will continue to increase due to the growing number and quality of providers of web based business and financial information 
if our reputation is damaged or if potential customers and employees are not familiar with our services  we may not be able to attract new  or retain existing  customers and employees 
the promotion and enhancement of our name will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide valuable services and to successfully market our services 
if customers do not perceive our services to be effective or high quality  our brand name  reputation  and business may suffer 
if the internet becomes subject to increased legislation and government regulation  use of the internet as a medium to receive subscription based information services may decline  and we may be subject to litigation  either of which may have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the laws governing the internet continue to be unsettled  even in areas where there has been legislative action 
legislation may dampen the growth in the use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a medium to receive subscription based information services 
in addition  due to the global nature of the internet  it is possible that  although our corporate headquarters are located in the commonwealth of massachusetts and pre production and development relating to our services occurs primarily in the commonwealth of massachusetts  other states  the united states  or foreign countries may attempt to regulate our services or levy sales or other applicable taxes on our web based products 
we cannot guarantee that violations of federal  state  local or other laws will not be alleged by governmental entities  that we may not unintentionally violate these laws or that these laws will not be modified  or new laws enacted  in the future 
any of these developments may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
any one or more of these factors may affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations  and this makes the prediction of results of operations on a quarterly basis unreliable 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations and annualized contract values are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication for future performance 
also  due to these and other factors  it is possible that our quarterly results of operations including the annualized contract value may be below expectations 
if this happens  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk onesource is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
however  our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of our united kingdom subsidiary are almost exclusively conducted in local currency 
operating results are translated into united states dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on intercompany transactions was immaterial for the years ended december    and we do not engage in hedging activities 

table of contents onesource also owns money market funds that are sensitive to market risks as part of its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve onesource s capital until it is required to fund operations  including onesource s sales and marketing and product development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
the investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates 
onesource does not enter into derivatives or any other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we have no long term debt obligations 
as of december   onesource had million in cash and cash equivalents
