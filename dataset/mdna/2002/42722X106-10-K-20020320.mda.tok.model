item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read with the december  audited consolidated financial statements and notes to those financial statements included in this form k 
statements concerning future performance  developments or events  concerning expectations for growth and market forecasts  and any other guidance on future periods  constitute forward looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which might cause actual results to differ materially from stated expectations 
specific factors include  but are not limited to the effect of interest rate changes  risks associated with acquisition of other banks and opening new branches  the ability to control costs and expenses  and general economic conditions 
additional information on these and other factors  which could affect our financial results are included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
general in the fiscal year ended june   we began to implement a growth strategy to broaden our products and services from traditional thrift offerings to those more closely related to commercial banking 
that strategy included  geographic and product expansion  loan portfolio diversification  development of relationship banking  and maintenance of asset quality 
in the fiscal year ended june   our growth strategy was bolstered by two significant events the january stock offering and conversion  and our acquisition of north pacific bancorporation 
through the january stock offering  we raised million in net new capital  which has  and will continue to  enhance our ability to implement our growth strategy 
using million of the net proceeds of the stock offering  we completed our first bank acquisition in june by purchasing all of the outstanding stock of north pacific bancorporation whose wholly owned subsidiary was north pacific bank 
the all cash transaction was accounted for using purchase accounting rules 
the acquisition of north pacific bank provided further geographical expansion into the pierce county market area and enhanced expertise in commercial banking 
during the six months ended december   we integrated the operations of north pacific bank into heritage bank culminating in the merging of data processing systems effective november  and substantially upgrading north pacific bank s item processing capability to handle existing and projected future volumes 
consistent with our strategy  on march   we merged with washington independent bancshares  inc  whose wholly owned subsidiary was central valley bank 
in the merger  we exchanged  shares of our common stock for all of the outstanding shares of washington independent bancshares  inc common stock 
this merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly  our financial information has been restated to include the accounts and results of operations of washington independent bancshares  inc for all periods presented 
in  we were continuing to operate with capital levels well in excess of regulatory requirements and well in excess of our internal needs 
we determined that buying our own shares with some of our excess capital was the best use of this capital and we began to buy back our outstanding shares 
we began in april with the repurchase of  shares of our outstanding common stock for million  or per share 
in october  we began the first of four phases of the stock repurchase programs 
the first phase of the repurchase program totaled  shares  or of the then outstanding shares  which began in october and ended in february the second phase totaled  shares  or of the then outstanding shares  which began in february and ended in august the third phase totaled  shares  which represented of the then outstanding shares  which began in august and ended in may the fourth phase began during may for a total of  shares  which represented of the then outstanding shares  of which  shares were repurchased as of december  by december   we repurchased a total of  shares of our stock representing of the total outstanding as of march  at an average price of per share 
in  we conducted an extensive review of our strategic direction culminating in a new strategic plan that reaffirmed our goals with an increased emphasis on return on average equity and efficiency of operations 
in pursuit of this strategy  we announced in january an initiative titled vision for heritage bank 
to assist us  we engaged alex sheshunoff management services  lp asm 
asm completed an opportunities assessment during fiscal year for heritage bank with the objective of determining ways that we can optimize our earnings performance 
beginning in march  asm worked with us to implement those opportunities identified 
we incurred the majority of the expenses associated with this project during the first and second quarters of we realized the benefits in the form of revenue enhancements and reduced expenses beginning with the third quarter of net interest income our profitability depends primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between the income we receive on our loan and investment portfolios  and our cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates and government policies 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread  and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table provides relevant net interest income information for selected time periods 
the average loan balances presented in the table are net of allowances for loan losses 
nonaccrual loans have been included in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield

our net income was million or per diluted share for the year ended december  compared to million or per diluted share for the previous year 
the growth in income primarily resulted from a strong mortgage banking environment leading to increased loan sale gains  the success of heritage bank s vision initiative  and our ability to maintain our net interest margin in a sharply declining interest rate environment 
average earning assets increased million  ending the year at million compared to the previous year end of million 
the average rate on average earning assets declined by basis points 
average costing liabilities grew million with cost of funds declining by basis points over the prior year 
the difference in growth between average earning assets and costing liabilities is the result of stock repurchases during the year 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  for the year ended december  compared with the previous year 
the growth in net interest income resulted primarily from maintaining the net interest margin in a sharply declining interest rate environment 
average loans increased by million with a decline in the average rate of basis points 
average deposits increased million with a more significant decline in the average rate of basis points 
net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets net interest margin for the year ended december  decreased to from for the previous year 
our net interest spread for the year ended december  increased to from for the prior year 
this corresponded with the decrease in the average cost of funds to for the year ended december  from for the same period last year as well as the decrease in the average rate of interest earning assets to for the year ended december  from for the same period last year 
the declining rate environment is a result of a weakening economy and an effort by the federal reserve to stimulate the economy 
provision for loan losses 
during the year ended december   we provided million through operations to maintain our allowance at an adequate level because of a weakening economy and the increase in our commercial loan portfolio 
for the year ended december   we experienced net charge offs of  the provision increased our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans to at december  from at the end of while our loan portfolio  and in particular commercial loans  has grown substantially over the past several years  our asset quality has remained solid as demonstrated by the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of at december  we consider the allowance for loan losses at december  to adequately cover reasonably foreseeable loan losses based on our assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including the level of problem loans  business conditions  estimated collateral values  loss experience  and credit concentrations 
see the previous discussion on the allowance for loan losses for further information about these factors 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased million for the year ended december  compared with the prior year 
mortgage banking income increased  as result of the declining interest rates and the large increase in refinancing of real estate loans 
total sales of mortgage loans increased by million to million for the year ended versus million in service charges on deposits increased  resulting from increased service charges and increased demand for deposit products 
other income increased  for as compared to this increase in other income was due to the  increase in merchant visa income  which is a relatively new product line that continues to expand 
additionally  the increase in other income was attributable to the sale of heritage bank s ownership interest in transalliance corporation a debit credit card processor  which resulted in a gain on sale of investment of noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased million for the year ended compared to the period 
personnel expenses increased a modest  despite the  increase in mortgage commissions 
as a result of the vision initiative  heritage bank experienced employee layoffs and restructured mortgage commission incentives 
therefore  personnel expenses did not increase during the year 
other expenses increased  due primarily to the costs associated with the vision initiative of  we incurred vision expenses during the first half of the year  which were primarily consulting fees paid to alex sheshunoff management services  lp merchant visa expenses also increased by   which was in line with the increase in merchant visa income 
results of operations for the years ended december  and net income 
our net income was million or per diluted share for the year ended december  as compared to million or per diluted share for the growth in income primarily resulted from a million growth in average earning assets for the year compared to average costing liabilities grew million contributing to a narrowing net interest margin 
the difference in growth between average earning assets and costing liabilities is the result of stock repurchases during the year 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  for the year ended december  compared with  primarily as a result of the million increase in the average balance of loans 
average interest earning assets grew million as average short term investments primarily overnight deposits decreased by million 
the reduction of short term investments was used along with the growth in average deposits of million to fund loan growth and repurchase stock 
net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets net interest margin for the year ended december  decreased to from for the decrease resulted from the strong growth in average deposits  particularly certificates of deposit which grew million but which have a higher cost 
during and we were able to utilize our excess capital from the january proceeds of the conversion from mutual to stock ownership to reduce our reliance on higher costing sources of funds 
with the stock repurchase beginning in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our excess capital levels to the benefit of our return on average equity and earnings per share but at the expense of a greater reliance on costing liabilities 
our net interest spread for the year ended december  decreased to from for the prior year 
this corresponded with the increase in the average cost of funds to for the year ended december  from for the same period last year 
these rate shifts resulted from the increased demand for funds to support loan growth and the stock repurchase program 
provision for loan losses 
during the year ended december   we provided  through operations to maintain our allowance for loan losses at an adequate level during a time of change in loan portfolio composition and loan growth 
in the year ended december   we experienced net recoveries of  the provision increased our allowance for loan loss to total loan ratio to at december  from at the end of while our loan portfolio  and in particular commercial loans  has grown substantially over the past three years  our asset quality has remained strong as demonstrated by the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of at december  we did not include one credit for  in the year end totals that we now expect to foreclose on in the first quarter of this credit was classified as performing due to the strength of the underlying collateral 
had this credit been included with nonperforming assets the ratio to total assets would have been only 
because commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending  we have increased the portion of our general allowance for loan losses allocated to our commercial loans over the past four years 
we consider the allowance for loan losses at december  to adequately cover reasonably foreseeable loan losses based on our assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including the level of problem loans  business conditions  estimated collateral values  loss experience  and credit concentrations 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased  for the year ended december  compared with the prior year 
increases in service charges on deposits offset the reduction in mortgage banking income 
service charges on deposits increased  resulting from increased service charges and demand for deposit products 
other income increased  for as compared to the decrease in mortgage banking income is attributable to the region wide reduction in the level of mortgage banking activity beginning the second quarter of loan sale gains fell  to  for from  in this corresponds with a reduction of total mortgage production of million during the year ended december   which was down from the prior year production of million by million 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased  for the year ended compared to the period 
increased personnel and occupancy costs were offset with reductions in all other categories 
personnel costs increased  for as a result of reduced salary deferrals resulting from lower loan production 
costs deferred in were  compared to  for  a decrease of  
occupancy costs increased  in resulting from increased maintenance and repair expenses the construction of a new branch to replace heritage bank s old spanaway branch and the opening of a new branch in ellensburg  washington by central valley bank 
other expenses decreased  for compared to liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits  loan repayments  loan sales  interest earned on and proceeds from investment securities  and advances from the fhlb of seattle 
these funds  together with retained earnings  equity and other borrowed funds  are used to make loans  acquire investment securities and other assets  and fund continuing operations 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
we must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  satisfy other financial commitments  and fund operations 
we generally maintain sufficient cash and short term investments to meet short term liquidity needs 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  or of total assets 
at december   our banks maintained a credit facility with the fhlb of seattle for million of which million was outstanding at that date 
to fund growth in  our strategy has been to acquire core deposits which we define to include all deposits except public funds from our retail accounts  acquire noninterest bearing demand deposits from our commercial customers  and use available credit lines 
total deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the largest increase in deposits occurred in savings accounts  which grew million to million at december  from million at december  borrowings decreased million  primarily through fhlb advances  which decreased to million at december  from million at december  we anticipate that we will continue to rely on the same sources of funds in the future and use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase investment securities 
we  and our banks  are subject to various regulatory capital requirements 
as of december   we  and our banks were classified as well capitalized institutions under the criteria established by the federal deposit insurance act 
our initial public offering in january of significantly increased our capital to levels well in excess of regulatory requirements and our internal needs 
as more fully discussed in the general section of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in we determined that buying our own shares with some of our excess capital was the best use of this capital and we began to buy back our company s outstanding shares 
as of december   we have repurchased  shares of our stock representing of the total outstanding as of march  at an average price of reducing our capital levels by million 
our capital levels will also be modestly impacted by our k employee stock ownership plan and trust ksop 
the employee stock ownership plan esop purchased of the common stock issued in the january stock offering and borrowed from the company to fund the purchase of the company s common stock 
the loan to the esop will be repaid principally from the bank s contributions to the esop 
the bank s contributions will be sufficient to service the debt over the year loan term at the interest rate of 
as the debt is repaid  shares are released  and allocated to plan participants based on the proportion of debt service paid during the year 
as shares are released  compensation expense is recorded equal to the then current market price of the shares  our capital is increased  and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share calculations 
for the year ended december   the company has allocated or committed to be released to the esop  earned shares and has  unearned  restricted shares remaining to be released 
the fair value of unearned  restricted shares held by the esop trust was  at december  asset liability management our primary financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while controlling our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
to accomplish this objective  we have formulated an interest rate risk management policy that attempts to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities while maintaining an acceptable interest rate sensitivity position 
the principal strategies which we employ to control our interest rate sensitivity are selling most long term  fixed rate  one to four family residential mortgage loan originations  originating commercial loans and residential construction loans at variable interest rates for terms generally one year or less  and offering noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts to businesses and individuals 
the longer term objective is to increase the proportion of noninterest bearing demand deposits  low interest bearing demand deposits  money market accounts  and savings deposits relative to certificates of deposit to reduce interest sensitivity and risk 
our asset and liability management strategies have resulted in a positive month gap of and a positive one year gap of as of december  these gaps measure the difference between the dollar amount of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within the designated period three months and one year as a percentage of total interest earning assets  based on certain estimates and assumptions as discussed below 
we believe that the implementation of our operating strategies has reduced the potential effects of changes in market interest rates on our results of operations 
the positive gap for the month period indicates that decreases in market interest rates may adversely affect our results over that period 
the following table provides the estimated maturity or repricing and the resulting interest rate sensitivity gap of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  based upon estimates of expected mortgage prepayment rates and deposit reduction rates consistent with national trends 
we adjusted mortgage loan maturities for loans held for sale by reflecting these loans in three month category which is consistent with their sale in the secondary mortgage market 
the amounts in the table are derived from our internal data 
we used certain assumptions in presenting this data so the amounts may not be consistent with other financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the amounts in the tables also could be significantly affected by external factors  such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawal of deposits  and competition 
estimated maturity or repricing within more than months months years years years total dollars in thousands interest earnings assets loans       investment securities       fhlb stock   fed funds sold   interest earning deposits   total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities total interest bearing deposits     fhlb advances and other borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities     rate sensitivity gap       cumulative rate sensitivity gap amount      as a percentage of interest earning assets certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  some assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features  which restrict changes in the interest rates of those assets both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets 
further  if a change in market interest rates occurs  prepayment  and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease if market interest rates increase substantially 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation affects our operations by increasing operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates

of the same title 
this statement revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  but carries over most of sfas no 
s provisions without reconsideration 
this statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  it is effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted sfas no

business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangibles will be evaluated against this new criteria and may result in certain intangibles being included in goodwill 
alternatively  certain amounts initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and recognized apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a nonamortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
the provisions of each statement  which apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to june  will be adopted by us on january  nonamortized goodwill in the amount of  is subject to the transition provisions of sfas nos

the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  we will recognize a gain or loss on settlement
