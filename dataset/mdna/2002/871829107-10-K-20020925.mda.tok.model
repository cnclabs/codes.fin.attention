item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers throughout the united states and canada 
the company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth  foldouts  acquisitions  and constant emphasis on the development of its consolidated buying programs 
the company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its marketing associates and the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities 
these objectives require continuing investment 
sysco s resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
sysco s operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs  cash dividends  and acquisitions fitting within the company s overall growth strategy 
any remaining cash generated from operations may  at the discretion of management  be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program  while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt 
sysco s share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans  for acquisitions and to reduce shares outstanding  all of which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share 
management targets a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between to 
the ratio may exceed the target range from time to time due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
the ratio may also fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
this ratio was and at june  and june   respectively 
the company generated net cash from operations of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the overall increases in operating results contributed to the annual increases in cash flows from operations 
in addition  during the second quarter of fiscal  the company began reorganizing its supply chain to maximize consolidated efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement functions performed for the benefit of our customers 
the new structure resulted in the deferral of certain federal and state income tax payments which amounted to  for fiscal and was reflected in the increase in the deferred tax provision 
the company expects the positive cash flow effect of the deferral in fiscal to increase from fiscal levels 
the company expects the cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal and beyond to be less than fiscal levels  as it expects to begin making payments related to these deferrals in fiscal the company expects the cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal and beyond to be incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral 
in addition  a federal tax payment of  normally due in the fourth quarter of was deferred until the first quarter of as allowed by the internal revenue service due to the texas tropical storm allison disaster and is reflected in the decrease of accrued income taxes in fiscal cash used for investing activities was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal expenditures for facilities  fleet and other equipment were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in fiscal over prior years is primarily due to the construction and completion of new fold out facilities located in sacramento  california and columbia  south carolina and the ongoing construction of the fold out facility in las vegas  nevada 
fiscal expenditures also included costs incurred on the construction or expansion of facilities in lewisville  texas  norman  oklahoma  baraboo  wisconsin and jersey city  new jersey 
total expenditures in fiscal are expected to increase to the range of  to  due to the continuation of the fold out program  facility  fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions  and the company s supply chain initiatives 
expenditures for acquisitions of businesses were  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal in february  the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement covering  shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions

they include a redemption provision which allows sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to insure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption 
proceeds from the notes were used to pay down borrowings under the company s commercial paper program

concurrent with the issuance of these notes  sysco entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  whereby sysco receives a fixed rate equal to per anum and pays a benchmark interest rate of six month libor in arrears less basis points 
in may  sysco international  co  a wholly owned subsidiary of sysco  issued  principal amount of notes due june  in a private offering 
these notes  which were priced at of par  are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by sysco corporation and are not subject to any sinking fund requirement 
they include registration rights and a redemption provision which allows sysco international  co 
to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to insure that the note holders are not penalized by the early redemption 
sysco international  co 
and sysco have filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering an identical series of notes to be issued in exchange for the unregistered notes outstanding 
the proceeds from the notes were utilized to repay commercial paper borrowings issued by sysco international  co 
to fund the acquisition of a canadian broadline foodservice business 
sysco has uncommitted bank lines of credit  which provide for unsecured borrowings for working capital up to  of which none was outstanding at june  and  was outstanding at june  sysco has a commercial paper program in the united states which was supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of  as of june  maturing in fiscal in september  the company entered into a new revolving loan agreement in the amount of  maturing in fiscal sysco also has a commercial paper program in canada which is supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of  in canadian dollars maturing in fiscal during fiscal  and  commercial paper and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately  to   to  and  to  respectively 
commercial paper borrowings were  as of june  and  as of august  the company intends to settle outstanding commercial paper borrowings when they come due by issuing additional commercial paper or retiring them utilizing cash generated from operations 
the net cash provided by operations less cash utilized for capital expenditures  the stock repurchase program  cash dividends and other uses resulted in net long term debt of  at june  after adjusting for the interest rate swap  approximately of the long term debt is at fixed rates averaging and the remainder is at floating rates averaging 
sysco continues to have borrowing capacity available and alternative financing arrangements are evaluated as appropriate 
in summary  sysco believes that through continual monitoring and management of assets together with the availability of additional capital in the financial markets  it will meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth certain information concerning sysco s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments 
payments due by period total over obligations year years years years years years in thousands short term debt and commercial paper   long term debt        capital lease obligations    long term non capitalized leases        total contractual cash obligations        outstanding letters of credit   sales sales increased in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the annual sales increases were attributable to a variety of factors  including the progress of our customers are really everything to sysco cares customer relationship initiatives  a persistent focus on increasing sales to marketing associate served customers  the continuing recognition by customers of the quality and value of sysco brand products  the overall growth in the foodservice industry and acquisitions 
after adjusting for food cost increases and acquisitions  real sales growth was approximately in acquisitions represented of sales increases for fiscal and food cost inflation was

after adjusting for food cost increases  acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in fiscal  real sales growth was approximately in fiscal acquisitions represented of sales increases in fiscal and food cost inflation was approximately for fiscal the lower sales growth in was attributable to the overall softness in the economy and comparisons to sales increases in fiscal which were among the highest in sysco s history 
the quarterly real sales growth trends experienced by the company were   and for the first  second  third and fourth quarter of fiscal  respectively  over comparable quarters in fiscal industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real growth of approximately in calendar year and in calendar year sales for fiscal through were as follows fiscal year sales increase a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below canned and dry products fresh and frozen meats frozen fruits  vegetables  bakery and other poultry dairy products fresh produce paper and disposables seafoods beverage products janitorial products equipment and smallwares medical supplies a comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below restaurants hospitals and nursing homes schools and colleges hotels and motels all other cost of sales cost of sales increased approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the rate of increases were less than the rate of sales increases leading to improved gross margins 
the rate of increase is influenced by sysco s overall customer and product mix  economies realized in purchasing and higher sales of sysco brand products 
operating expenses operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling and administrative expenses 
these expenses as a percent of sales were for fiscal and and for fiscal changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several economic influences  including customer mix 
inflationary increases in operating costs generally have been offset through improved productivity 
operating expenses in fiscal were negatively impacted by increased costs realized during the initial operating periods of fold outs in sacramento  california  columbia  south carolina and las vegas  nevada 
in addition  the increase in marketing associate served sales is accompanied by higher expenses to serve these customers 
in fiscal  expenses were incurred in connection with the closing of a facility and one time non recurring costs associated with the completion of the sysco uniform systems implementation 
the sum of the costs related to fiscal were approximately  interest expense interest expense for the year decreased  or approximately below fiscal  which had increased  or approximately over fiscal the decrease in interest expense in fiscal was primarily due to decreases in interest rates for short term and commercial paper borrowings 
interest expense in fiscal included interest income in the amount of  related to a federal income tax refund on an amended return 
after adjusting for the refund  interest expense in the fiscal period decreased  or approximately 
this decrease was due primarily to decreased borrowings 
interest capitalized during construction periods for the past three years was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal other  net other  net was  income in fiscal  an increase of  from the  expense in fiscal fiscal s expense of  decreased  from the  expense in fiscal changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities  primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities 
earnings before income taxes earnings before income taxes rose  or approximately above fiscal which had increased  or approximately  over fiscal fiscal increased  or approximately over fiscal additional sales and realization of operating efficiencies contributed to the increases as well as the company s success in its continued efforts to increase sales to the company s higher margin territorial street customers and increasingly higher sales of sysco brand products  both of which generally yield higher margins 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal and and in fiscal earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change fiscal represents the twenty sixth consecutive year of increased earnings before the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
earnings before cumulative effect of an accounting change rose  or approximately above fiscal  which had increased  or approximately over fiscal fiscal increased  or approximately over fiscal the increases were caused by additional sales  operating efficiencies and other factors discussed above 
cumulative effect of accounting change in the first quarter of fiscal  sysco recorded a one time  after tax  non cash charge of  to comply with the required adoption of aicpa statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop required the writeoff of any unamortized costs of start up activities and organization costs 
net earnings net earnings for the year increased  or approximately above fiscal  which had increased  or approximately over fiscal fiscal increased  or approximately over fiscal return on shareholders equity the return on average shareholders equity was approximately in fiscal and fiscal and in fiscal since its inception sysco has averaged in excess of an return on shareholders equity before the cumulative effect of accounting changes 
broadline segment broadline segment sales increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the fiscal and sales growth was due primarily to increased sales to marketing associate served customers as well as increased sales of sysco brand products 
broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal and from in fiscal to in fiscal the decreases in fiscal and fiscal were due primarily to acquisitions of specialty meat  lodging industry product and produce companies in the other segments and greater percentage growth of specialty meat  lodging industry companies and sygma segment as a percentage of overall sysco sales 
earnings before income taxes from the broadline segment increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases in earnings before income taxes for fiscal and fiscal were driven by increased sales to marketing associate served customers as well as increases in sales of sysco brand products  both of which generally yield higher margins 
completion of the installation of sysco uniform systems in the second quarter of fiscal also impacted pretax earnings with increased efficiencies and productivity 
sygma segment sygma segment sales increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal the fiscal and sales growth was due primarily to sales growth in sygma s existing customer base 
sygma segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal and decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to the acquisition of specialty meat  lodging industry product and produce companies in the other segments 
earnings before income taxes for the segment increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases in fiscal and fiscal were due to operating efficiencies and improved labor costs realized during the current fiscal year 
other segments the other segment sales increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal other segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal and from in fiscal to in fiscal the increases were due primarily to the timing of acquisitions made during the periods presented 
earnings before income taxes increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases were due primarily to the timing of acquisitions made during the periods presented 
in fiscal  earnings were negatively impacted by the downturn in demand in travel and resort destination cities which are serviced by certain of the specialty companies 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting polices employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
sysco s most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  self insurance programs  pension plans and accounting for business combinations 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sysco evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  we record a specific reserve for bad debts to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to collect and write off such amounts at the end of each fiscal year 
in addition  we recognize reserves for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional reserves may be required 
self insurance program sysco maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  group medical  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured 
self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and include an estimate for significant claims incurred but not reported 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate our risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  we have implemented safety procedures and awareness programs 
pension plans sysco maintains defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees 
the company also contributes to various multi employer plans under collective bargaining agreements 
the defined benefit pension plans pay benefits to employees at retirement using formulas based on a participant s years of service and compensation 
sysco also maintains a non qualified  unfunded supplementary executive retirement plan serp for key employees 
in order to meet its obligations under the serp  the company maintains life insurance policies on the lives of participants 
sysco is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies  which are excluded from plan assets in arriving at prepaid accrued benefit cost 
cash surrender values of such policies were  at june  and  at june  sysco accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions as amended by sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and these statements require that the amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis which include assumptions regarding the expected rate of return on plan assets  a discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  and the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels  as well as other assumptions 
for guidance in determining the discount rate  sysco looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments 
this rate was and as of june  and june   respectively 
sysco looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels 
sysco used a plan specific age related set of rates equivalent to a single rate of  as of june  and june  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was and as of june  and june   respectively 
management believes that this assumption is reasonable based on the investment policy and expectations of future returns for the various asset classes in which trust assets are invested 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets was  and a negative over the ten year  five year and one year periods ended december   respectively 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the performance of the stock market in and resulted in a decline in the value of the assets held by the pension plans 
as a result  the company was required to reflect a minimum pension liability of  net of tax  as of june  and  net of tax  as of june  minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase in the pension liability and on offsetting charge to shareholders equity  net of tax  through comprehensive loss rather than net income 
the company s prepaid benefit cost prior to the recognition of the additional minimum pension liability was  at june  and its accrued benefit cost prior to the recognition of the additional minimum pension liability was  at june  included in arriving at accrued benefit cost are  in deferred net actuarial losses resulting from the variance of actual experience from that projected by actuarial assumptions 
a portion of this unrecognized loss is amortized and recognized in accordance with sfas no 
in pension expense over time 
the company recognized net pension costs of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
accounting for business combinations goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  sysco assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the amortization of these intangibles over their remaining lives can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the acquired operations 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured by the amount in which the carrying amounts exceed the projected discounted future operating cash flows 
sysco will adopt sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal year which discontinues the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles and requires an annual test of impairment based on a comparison of fair value to carrying values 
the evaluation of impairment under both the existing rules and sfas no 
requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations 
actual results could differ from projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
based on a preliminary assessment  sysco does not believe its goodwill is impaired and does not expect to record a charge from the adoption of sfas no 
new accounting standards in fiscal  sysco adopted the aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop provides guidance with respect to accounting for the various types of costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for sysco s use 
the adoption of sop did not have a significant effect on sysco s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in fiscal  sysco adopted the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 
these statements outline the accounting treatment for all derivative activity and their adoption did not have a significant effect on sysco s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in fiscal  sysco adopted the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the adoption of sab had no effect on sysco s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in june  sysco adopted sfas no 
 accounting for business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the pooling of interests method for business combinations initiated after june  sysco is adopting the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets effective with the beginning of fiscal year as a result  the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles will be discontinued 
goodwill and indefinite life intangibles arising from business combinations after june  are also not amortized 
the recoverability of goodwill and intangibles will be assessed annually or as needed by determining whether the fair value of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values 
sysco has six months from the date it adopts sfas no 
to test for cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
thereafter  any impairment losses will be included  net of tax  within the results of continuing operations 
management has completed its preliminary assessment of the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s consolidated financial statements and believes that goodwill is not impaired 
goodwill amortization  after tax  recognized by sysco was  in   in and  in in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas and the portion of the accounting principle board opinion no 
that deals with disposal of a business segment 
management does not expect sfas  which is effective for fiscal  to have a material effect on the results of operations 
risk factors low margin business  economic sensitivity the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins 
sysco makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup 
as a result  sysco s profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of food price deflation  even though sysco s gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 
the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions 
sysco s operating results are also sensitive to  and may be adversely affected by  other factors  including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable  inventory control  competitive price pressures  severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on sysco s past operations  there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results 
leverage and debt service because historically a substantial part of sysco s growth has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion  sysco s continued growth depends  in large part  on its ability to continue this expansion 
as a result  its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand 
moreover  any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of sysco s common stock 
further  sysco s leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures 
product liability claims sysco  like any other seller of food  faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness 
with respect to product liability claims  sysco believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance 
however  this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost  or  if available  may not be adequate to cover all of sysco s liabilities 
sysco generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products  but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited  as a practical matter  to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers 
if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available  product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce sysco s net income and earnings per share 
interruption of supplies sysco obtains substantially all of its foodservice products from third party suppliers 
for the most part  sysco does not have long term contracts with its suppliers committing them to provide products to sysco 
although sysco s purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers  suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by sysco in the quantities requested 
because sysco does not control the actual production of the products it sells  it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside its control 
these conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers  weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
sysco s inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise  could mean that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to customers  and customers may turn to other distributors 
labor relations as of june   approximately  employees at operating companies were members of different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations 
in fiscal  agreements covering approximately  employees will expire 
failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages 
although sysco s operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date  and sysco believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions  a work stoppage due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union contract  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on sysco 
integration of acquired companies if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic  operational and other benefits in a timely manner  its profitability may decrease 
integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when sysco acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or no expertise  or with a corporate culture different from sysco s 
if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully  it may incur substantial costs and delays in increasing its customer base 
in addition  the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may divert management s attention from sysco s existing business and may damage sysco s relationships with its key customers and suppliers 
charter and stockholder rights plan under its restated certificate of incorporation  sysco s board of directors is authorized to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors  depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued 
in addition  if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco  the stockholders of sysco have the right to purchase preferred stock of sysco pursuant to its stockholder rights plan  which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquiror 
the existence of either of these provisions could deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to sysco s stockholders 
forward looking statements certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include statements about sysco s ability to increase its market share and sales  long term debt to capitalization target ratios  anticipated capital expenditures  and sysco s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 
these statements are based on management s current expectations and estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above 
in addition  sysco s ability to increase its market share and sales  meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses 
the ability to meet long term debt to capitalization target ratios may also be affected by share repurchases  cash flow  acquisitions and internal growth 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
sysco s use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes the company to changes in the market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt 
sysco manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
at june   the company had outstanding one interest rate swap agreement whereby sysco exchanged the fixed interest payments on the  principal amount of notes for floating interest payments 
at june  the company had outstanding  of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through september  the company s long term debt obligations of  were primarily at fixed rates of interest except for  in fixed rate debt swapped to a floating rate of interest as discussed above
