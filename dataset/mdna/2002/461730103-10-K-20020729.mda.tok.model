results from operations for the fiscal years ended april    and iret operates on a fiscal year ending on april the following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal years ended april   and revenues total revenues of the operating partnership for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in revenues received during fiscal in excess of the prior year revenues was  this increase resulted from rent from properties acquired in fiscal in excess of that received in rent from properties in excess of fiscal increase in rental income on existing properties an increase in interest income an increase in straight line rents an increase in ancillary income a decrease in rent properties sold the increase in revenues received during fiscal in excess of that received in fiscal was  this increase resulted from rent from properties acquired in fiscal in excess of that received in rent from properties acquired completed in fiscal an increase in ancillary income an increase in rents an increase in rental income on existing properties an increase in interest income a decrease in boise warehouse rent bankruptcy of tenant a decrease in rent properties sold during as shown by the above analysis  the fiscal and increases in revenues resulted primarily from the addition of new real estate properties to the operating partnership s portfolio 
rents received on properties owned at the beginning of fiscal increased by  in fiscal and  in fiscal thus  new properties generated most of the new revenues during the past two years 
straight line rents beginning with our fiscal year  an accounting rule required us to record as revenue straight line rents on our commercial property leases that contain future rental increases 
this rule requires us to calculate the total rents that the tenant has contracted to pay us for the entire term of the lease and to divide that total by the number of months of the lease and to record as revenue each month the resulting average monthly rent 
the result is that  in the beginning years of a lease  we must record as revenue an amount that exceeds the actual cash rent we have collected 
in the later years of such leases  we  of course  will record as revenue an amount less than the actual cash then being received 
the amount of straight line rents that is  the amount that the recorded rent is greater than the actual cash rent we have collected we have recorded in the past three years is straight line rents our revenues  net income and funds from operations shown in this report are increased by the above described straight line rents

net cash used in investing activities decreased to  from the  used in fiscal this decrease resulted because less cash was needed to acquire new investment properties 
net cash provided from financing activities also decreased to  from the year earlier figure of  because of a small decrease in our activity in acquiring new properties using borrowed funds 
iret expects that its short term liquidity requirements will be met through the net cash provided by its operations and also expects that it will meet its long term liquidity requirements including scheduled debt maturities maturing investment certificates  construction and development activities  and property acquisitions through long term secured borrowings and the issuance of additional equity securities including shares of beneficial interest of the company as well as limited partnership units of the operating partnership to be issued in connection with acquisitions of improved real estate properties 
iret believes that its net cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and cash distribution to its shareholders in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and long term 
budgeted expenditures for ongoing maintenance and capital improvements and renovations to its real estate portfolio are expected to be funded from cash flow generated from operations of these properties 
of the  of mortgage indebtedness on april    is represented by variable rate mortgages on which the future interest rate will vary based on changes in the interest rate index for each respective loan and the balance of fixed rate mortgages was  the principal payments due on all of the mortgage indebtedness are as follows year ending april mortgage principal later years total in addition to its cash and marketable securities  iret properties has unsecured line of credit agreements with first international bank trust  bremer bank  and first western bank trust  all of minot  north dakota  totaling  none of which were in use on april  and on april    was in use 
increased costs and economic slowdown in fiscal  iret experienced a sharp increase in the cost of utilities primarily natural gas in its apartment communities 
since that time  natural gas prices have retreated  but it is possible that iret s apartment communities will again experience a sharp increase in utility expenses which may not be recoverable in the form of increased rent 
maintenance and other rental expenses also continue to increase at the general inflationary rate of 
in most cases  iret has been able to increase rental income sufficient to cover the normal inflationary increases in rental expenses  but did experience a substantial loss as a result of increased natural gas and snow removal expenses in fiscal with respect to iret s commercial properties  in virtually all cases  the tenant is responsible to pay utilities and most other rental expenses 
however  commercial leases tend to be of a longer term and iret is precluded from increasing rent to compensate for inflationary changes in currency values 
in the case of residential properties  no leases are longer than one year and the majority are for six months or less and thus iret may raise rent to cover inflationary changes in expenses and the value of its capital investment  subject to market conditions 
iret s insurance costs will increase substantially during the coming year 
this increase in insurance costs  prior to september  was not anticipated by management 
given the weakened economic state  it is unlikely iret will be able to increase rents sufficiently to fully offset its increased costs 
as a result  our expectation is that net income and ffo will still increase over the prior year  but at a lower rate than the ffo growth of fiscal increasing ownership of commercial properties historically  the assets in our investment portfolio consisted predominantly of multi family residential properties  as compared to commercial properties 
more recently  our investment activities have caused this balance to shift so that the percentage of commercial properties held in our portfolio has increased significantly 
within the past two years  approximately of our property acquisitions have been commercial properties due to the greater availability of these properties on terms that meet our financial and strategic objectives 
if current market conditions continue  we anticipate that the percentage of commercial properties could equal or exceed the percentage of multi family residential properties during fiscal this may not  however  be a long term trend as in future periods we may purchase a greater percentage of multi family residential properties depending on market conditions 
our historical experience in acquiring multi family residential properties may not be directly applicable to the acquisition of a greater percentage of commercial properties 
commercial properties involve different risks than multi family residential properties  including direct exposure to business and economic downturns  exposure to tenant lease terminations or bankruptcies  and competition from real estate investors with greater experience in developing and owning commercial properties 
current and future vacancies in the twelve months subsequent to april   leases covering approximately of our total commercial square footage will expire 
at april   approximately of our total commercial square footage was vacant 
of that vacancy  approximately is represented by the warehouse in boise  idaho  which has been vacant for the last months 
at april   approximately of the units in our multi family stabilized residential properties were vacant 
due to the overall general economic slowdown  we are expecting that our vacancy rates will increase over the next to months 
additionally  rent rates for commercial property in the minneapolis area have stagnated at current levels with little possibility for increases in the next to months 
geographic concentration in north dakota and minnesota the majority of our assets are presently invested in real estate properties in north dakota and minnesota 
for the year ended april   we received of our commercial gross revenue from commercial properties in minnesota and of our commercial gross revenue from commercial properties in north dakota 
minnesota accounts for of our commercial real estate portfolio by square footage  while north dakota accounts for 
for the year ended april   we received of our apartment gross revenue from multi family residential properties in minnesota and of our apartment gross revenue from multi family properties in north dakota 
as of that same date  we owned  apartment units  of our total number of apartment units  in minnesota  and  apartment units  of our total number of apartment units  in north dakota 
we intend to continue focusing on real estate activities in the state of minnesota which will result in an increase to our current concentration in the upper midwest 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
residential rental properties are leased under operating leases with terms generally of one year or less 
commercial properties are leased under operating leases to tenants for various terms exceeding one year 
lease terms often include renewal options 
rental revenue is recognized on the straight line basis  which averages minimum required rents over the terms of the leases 
rents recognized in advance of collection are reflected as rent receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
iret evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts periodically 
in performing its evaluation  management assesses the recoverability of individual real estate mortgage loans and rent receivables by a comparison of their carrying amount with their estimated net realizable value 
reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred 
iret receives payments for these reimbursements from substantially all its multi tenant commercial tenants throughout the year based on estimates 
differences between estimated recoveries and the final billed amounts  which are immaterial  are recognized in the subsequent year 
a number of the commercial leases provide for a base rent plus a percentage rent based on gross sales in excess of a stipulated amount 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved and are included in rental income at that time 
profit on sales of real estate shall be recognized in full when the real estate is sold  provided the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured or the amount that will be collectible can be estimated and the seller is not obliged to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit 
any gain or loss on a sale or disposition is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
accounting for property owned 
real estate is stated at cost 
expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized 
refurbishment type costs such as property wide painting  carpeting  wallpaper  tiling  replacement of worn out appliances  replacement of worn out bathroom fixtures  replacement of worn out windows  siding  roofs  walkways  parking lots or landscaping  and any other type of refurbishment activity is capitalized 
interest  real estate taxes  and other development costs relating to the acquisition and development of certain qualifying properties are also capitalized 
expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs  such as individual apartment painting  wallpapering  cleaning  and appliance repair  which do not add to the value or extend useful lives  are charged to expense as incurred 
iret assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its real estate by comparing its carrying amount to the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows without interest charges 
such cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
such market factors include a lessee s ability to pay rent under the terms of the lease 
if a property is leased at a significantly lower rent  iret may recognize a loss if the income stream is not sufficient to recover its investment 
if impairment is determined to be present  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the property s fair value 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on its current and future fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
even though our philosophy is to maintain a fairly low exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk  we are still vulnerable to significant fluctuations in interest rates on its variable rate debt  on any future repricing or refinancing of its fixed rate debt and on future debt 
we primarily use long term more than ten years and medium term five to seven years debt as a source of capital 
we do not currently use derivative securities  interest rate swaps or any other type of hedging activity to manage our costs of capital 
as of april   we had the following amount of future principal payments on mortgages secured by our real estate long term debt thereafter total fixed rate variable rate average interest rate the weighted average interest rate as of april   was 
any fluctuations on the variable interest rates could increase or decrease our interest expenses 
for example  an increase of one percent per annum on our  of variable rate indebtedness would increase our annual interest expense by
