item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a worldwide leader in the design  development  manufacture and support of process control metrology systems used in semiconductor device manufacturing 
our proprietary systems measure the thickness and other properties of thin films applied during various steps in the manufacture of integrated circuits  enabling semiconductor device manufacturers to improve yields and reduce overall production costs 
we provide our customers with a flexible full fab metrology solution by offering families of systems that meet their transparent and opaque thin film measurement needs in various applications across the fabrication process 
our two primary families of metrology solutions offer leading edge metrology technology  flexible systems cost effectively designed for specific manufacturing applications and a common production worthy automation platform  all backed by worldwide support 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few end user customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
in  and sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for  and of our revenues 
in  and sales to intel accounted for  and of our revenues 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to particular distributors 
these distributors purchase our products for ultimate distribution to customers in particular geographic regions 
in  sales to tokyo electron limited  or tel  our exclusive distributor in japan  and to distributor metron technology accounted for and of our revenues 
in and  sales to tel accounted for and of our revenues 
we terminated our distribution agreement with metron in august currently  the only distributor we use is tel 
we expect that sales to tel will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for at least the next several years 
we do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers or distributors that obligate them to continue to purchase our products  and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time 
a delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly 
in addition  during a given quarter  a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
our transparent film measurement systems range in price from approximately  to million per system and our opaque film measurement systems range in price from approximately  to million per system 
accordingly  a small change in the number of systems we sell may also cause significant changes in our operating results 
because fluctuations in the timing of orders from our major customers or distributors or in the number of our individual systems we sell could cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly in any given quarter or year  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are necessarily meaningful  and they should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the united states  and we expect this trend to continue 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
the sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to months  and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology 
due to the length of these cycles  we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments 
additionally  the rate and timing of customer orders may vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  if sales of our products do not occur when we expect  and we are unable to adjust our estimates on a timely basis  our expenses and inventory levels may increase relative to revenues and total assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our statements of income data as percentages of our revenues

our revenues are derived from the sale of our metrology systems  services and spare parts 
our revenues were million  million and million in the years  and these changes represent an increase of from to and a decrease of from to the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to increases in unit volume shipments to existing customers and expanded sales of our millimeter and copper products  partially offset by the impact of the new accounting method for revenue recognition 
the decrease in revenues from to was primarily due to an industry wide slowdown in demand for semiconductor devices and equipment 
this resulted in a decrease in orders for our products as well as postponements and cancellations of existing orders 
revenues from customers outside of the united states represented  and of our revenues in  and revenues from customers outside of the united states increased as a percentage of revenues from to as a result of increased sales to existing customers in europe and asia 
we expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues consists of the labor  material and overhead costs of manufacturing our systems  spare parts cost and the cost associated with our worldwide service support infrastructure 
our gross profit was million  million and million in  and these changes represent an increase of from to and a decrease of from to our gross profit represented  and of our revenues in  and the increase in gross profit margin from to resulted from improved manufacturing efficiencies due to outsourcing and cycle time reduction initiatives and higher revenues  which cover a larger portion of fixed costs 
the increase in gross profit dollars was the result of higher unit sales 
there can be no assurances that our outsourcing and cycle time reduction initiatives will be effective or materially increase our gross profit margins 
the decrease in gross profit margin from to was primarily due to a decrease in business volume  which resulted in customer support and fixed manufacturing costs being a higher component of a lower revenue base 
research and development 
the thin film transparent and opaque process control metrology market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations 
we believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products  including the transition to copper and low k dielectrics  the progression to mm wafers  the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions  and the evolution of ultra thin gate process control  is critical to our success 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our technical  management and financial resources to research and development programs 
research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
they also include consulting fees  prototype equipment expenses and the cost of related supplies 
our research and development expenditures were  million  million and million in  and these changes represent an increase of from to and an increase of from to research and development expenditures represented  and of revenues in  and the increase in research and development expenses from to and from to resulted from higher personnel costs  parts costs associated with new product development and engineering facilities expansion 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales  marketing  and general administrative personnel  as well as commissions  and other non personnel related expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and these changes represent an increase of from to and a decrease of from to selling  general and administrative expense represented  and of revenues in  and the increase from to resulted from increased commissions  higher personnel related costs and the commencement of certain infrastructure projects 
the decrease from to resulted from lower commissions  the completion of certain infrastructure projects in prior periods and cost reduction initiatives 
amortization 
amortization expense is related to the core technology and goodwill we acquired from our predecessor company in our expense for amortization was million in and million in and interest expense income and other  net 
in interest expense  net of interest income of million  was million 
in november  we retired all of our outstanding debt with a portion of the proceeds of our initial public offering 
in  interest income was million as we invested the net proceeds from our initial public offering 
in  interest income increased to million resulting from investing the net proceeds from our follow on public offering in february included in other income is miscellaneous nonrecurring income resulting from the disposal of capital equipment and several other nonrecurring transactions 
other income was  in and  in both and provision benefit for income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our provision benefit for income taxes was a benefit of million in  a benefit of million in and a provision of million in our effective tax rate was  and in   and  respectively 
during  the net deferred tax asset was reduced to zero with a valuation allowance as a result of recurring losses and with the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income 
in and  based on industry and internal forecasts combined with the successful completion of our initial public offering and the reduction of debt  we reduced the deferred tax valuation allowance by million and million  for certain deferred tax assets that more likely than not would be realized 
we computed our effective tax rate for on prevailing federal and state rates adjusted for research and development tax credits and income derived from tax exempt interest 
extraordinary item 
our extraordinary item in resulted from the write off of deferred financing costs related to the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of  net of tax of  change in accounting principle 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition to comply with securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue is now recognized upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our products are sold and accounted for as multiple element arrangements  consisting of the sale of the product and installation 
we generally recognize revenue upon delivery of the product  which is prior to installation  as the actions required to perform the installation are deemed to be perfunctory 
installation is deemed to be perfunctory based on our sales and installation history for similar products and customers and the fact that other vendors can and have performed the installation 
when customer acceptance is subjective and not obtained prior to shipment  we defer a portion of the product revenue until such time as positive affirmation of acceptance has been obtained from the customer 
customer acceptance is generally based on our products meeting published performance specifications 
the amount of revenue allocated to the shipment of products is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered contract elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to product revenue 
the fair value of installation services is based upon billable hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
revenue related to undelivered installation services is deferred until such time as installation is completed at the customer s site 
previously  we had recognized revenue upon shipment of equipment to customers  which usually preceded installation and final customer acceptance  provided final customer acceptance and collection of the related receivable were probable 
the effect of the change was to increase revenue by million for the year ended december  and decrease revenue by million for the year ended december  the deferred revenue balance to be recognized in future periods as of december  was million 
preferred stock dividends 
we accrued cumulative dividends on our preferred stock of million in in november  we retired all of our outstanding preferred stock with a portion of the proceeds of our initial public offering and paid all accrued dividends 
liquidity and capital resources we increased our cash and cash equivalents from million at december  to million at december  our financial condition remained strong with working capital of million and million at december  and  respectively 
typically during periods of revenue growth  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers 
similarly  during periods of declining revenue  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million in and net cash provided by operating activities was in the use of cash in operating activities during and was primarily the result of having to fund an increase in accounts receivable and an increase in inventories  offset by net income 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to net income combined with a decrease in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and capital expenditures for were primarily used to establish our new manufacturing and customer training facility in new jersey 
capital expenditures for were primarily used for the purchase and installation of enterprise resource planning software  computer equipment necessary for our operations and costs associated with renovations to our corporate headquarters 
capital expenditures for were primarily used for renovations to our corporate facility and upgrades to existing computer systems 
capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and in november  we completed the initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
net proceeds to us after the underwriting discount and other fees amounted to million 
we used a portion of these funds to retire all outstanding long term debt and repay outstanding preferred stock 
in  net cash provided by financing activities equaled the cash proceeds received by us when our employees exercised stock options and participated in the employee stock purchase plan 
in february  we completed the follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
net proceeds to us after the underwriting discount and other fees amounted to million 
in addition  we received cash proceeds of million from stock option exercises and participation in our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations  will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next twelve months 
any significant acquisitions by us may require additional equity or debt financing to fund the purchase price  if paid in cash 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when required or that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and warranty obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition to comply with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our products are sold and accounted for as multiple element arrangements  consisting of the sale of the product and installation 
we generally recognize revenue upon delivery of the product  which is prior to installation  as the actions required to perform the installation are deemed to be perfunctory 
installation is deemed to be perfunctory based on our sales and installation history for similar products and customers and the fact that other vendors can and have performed the installation 
if the historical data we use to determine the perfunctory nature of installation is incorrect  we may have to recognize revenue at a later date 
when customer acceptance is subjective and not obtained prior to shipment  we defer a portion of the product revenue until such time as positive affirmation of acceptance has been obtained from the customer 
customer acceptance is generally based on our products meeting published performance specifications 
the amount of revenue allocated to the shipment of products is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered contract elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to product revenue 
the fair value of installation services is based upon billable hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
revenue related to undelivered installation services is deferred until such time as installation is completed at the customer s site 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or our assumptions are otherwise incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we had no valuation allowance established against our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy  are averse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments consisted primarily of commercial paper and municipal securities that mature in less than three months 
foreign currency risk we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or purchased currency options to hedge local currency cash flows or for trading purposes 
all sales arrangements with international customers are denominated in us dollars 
we have branch operations in taiwan  singapore and korea and a wholly owned subsidiary in europe  which are subject to currency fluctuations 
these foreign branches are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not expected to be material
