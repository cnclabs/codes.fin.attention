item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business combinations on may   kroger issued million shares of kroger common stock in connection with a merger  for all of the outstanding common stock of fred meyer inc  which operated stores primarily in the western region of the united states 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interest  and the accompanying financial statements have been restated to give effect to the consolidated results of kroger and fred meyer for all years presented 
common stock repurchase program on january   we began repurchasing common stock in order to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans 
these repurchases were made using the proceeds  including the tax benefit  from options exercised 
the board of directors authorized further repurchases of up to million of common stock in october on october   we rescinded the repurchase program as a result of execution of the merger agreement between kroger and fred meyer 
in december  we began a new program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans 
this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises  including the tax benefit 
in january  the board of directors authorized an additional repurchase plan for up to million of common stock 
during fiscal  we made open market purchases of approximately million under the stock option program and million under the million program 
on march   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of kroger common stock 
this repurchase program replaced the million program authorized in january during fiscal  we made open market purchases of approximately million under the stock option program and million under the million program 
on march   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an incremental billion of kroger common stock 
this repurchase program was in addition to the million stock buyback plan 
during fiscal  we made open market purchases of approximately million under the stock option program and million to complete the million program 
we also made open market purchases of million under the billion authorization 
purchases of stock under the board approved repurchase programs are made when the expected return exceeds our cost of capital 
capital expenditures capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in  most amounts were used to construct new stores 
the table below shows our supermarket storing activity beginning of year opened acquired closed end of year results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and compared to however  results are not directly comparable to results and results are not directly comparable to results due to a week year in and acquisitions

identical food store sales stores in operation and not expanded or relocated for four full quarters increased in and in comparable food store sales  which include expansions and relocations  increased in and in excluding sales at supermarket fuel centers  identical food store sales increased and comparable food store sales increased in gross profit coordinated purchasing  category management  technology related efficiencies and increases in corporate brand sales have enabled us to increase our gross profit to of sales in  from in  and in excluding one time expenses described in merger related costs and one time expenses below and the effect of lifo  gross profit as a percent of sales increased to in  from in and in operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrate expenses as a percent of sales were in  in  and in excluding one time expenses described in merger related costs and one time expenses below  operating  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were in  in and in these costs as a percent of sales increased due to higher health care and energy costs in and credit card fees as a percent of sales also increased in these increased costs offset significant productivity gains at the store level 
ebitda our bank credit facilities and the indentures underlying our publicly issued debt contain various restrictive covenants 
many of these covenants are based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  lifo charge  extraordinary loss  and one time items ebitda 
the ability to generate ebitda at levels sufficient to satisfy the requirements of these agreements is a key measure of our financial strength 
we do not intend the presentation of ebitda to be an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance 
presentation of ebitda is based on the definition contained in our bank credit facilities 
this may be a different definition than other companies use 
we were in compliance with all ebitda based bank credit facility and indenture covenants on february  ebitda for increased to  million from  million in ebitda for increased from  million in  without adjusting for the extra week in these ebitda increases were primarily due to economies of scale resulting from increased sales  efficiencies described in gross profit above  returns from capital investments and returns from recent acquisitions

the integration plan includes distribution consolidation  systems integration  store conversions  store closures and administration integration 
total pre tax merger related costs were million in  million in and million in in addition to merger related costs that are shown separately on the consolidated statement of income  we incurred other pre tax one time expenses that are included in merchandise costs and operating  general and administrative expenses 
one time expenses in included million of losses on energy purchase contracts and million of lease liabilities related to store closings 
expenses in also included million of lease liabilities for store closings 
remaining one time expenses incurred during and  and the expenses  were costs related to recent mergers 
during and  we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
in  we performed an impairment review due to new divisional leadership and updated profitability forecasts for and beyond 
in  we performed an impairment review due to recent investments by acquired companies in stores that did not perform as expected and updated profitability forecasts for and beyond 
in both years we identified impairment losses for assets to be disposed of and assets to be held and used 
in  we also identified impairment losses for certain investments in former suppliers that have experienced financial difficulty and with whom supply arrangements have ceased 
the charge relates to locations that either had not opened  or had only recently opened  when the impairment review was performed 
as a result  estimates of future operating performance for these locations were not determined at that time 
kroger also recorded a pre tax million restructuring charge in primarily for severance agreements associated with its strategic growth plan announced in december the table below details all of our merger related costs and one time items in millions merger related costs one time items related to mergers included in merchandise costs operating  general and administrative other one time items included in operating  general and administrative store closings operating  general and administrative energy contracts total one time items restructuring charges impairment charges total merger related costs and other one time items please refer to footnotes   and to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these items 
critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the significant accounting policies are summarized in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
workers compensation costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation claims 
liabilities are recognized based on claims filed  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
these liabilities are actuarially determined on a discounted basis 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 
the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability  which can affect the liability recorded for such claims 
for example  variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in such claims can impact amounts realized 
similarly  changes in legal trends and interpretations  as well as a change in the nature and method of how such claims ultimately are settled can impact ultimate costs 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  such changes could have a considerable impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
asset impairments we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred  such as current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
when a trigger event occurs  an impairment calculation is performed  comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores 
if impairment is identified for long lived assets other than real property  we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset s current carrying value and record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows 
with respect to owned property and equipment associated with closed stores  the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
impairment is recognized for the excess of carrying value over estimated fair market value  reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 
any reductions in the carrying value of assets resulting from the application of this policy are reflected in the income statement as asset impairment charges 
goodwill statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective for kroger on february  adoption of this standard will change our method of accounting for goodwill  which totaled  million as of february  goodwill no longer will be amortized and instead will be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
goodwill amortization expense totaled million in non amortization of goodwill will improve fiscal net earnings by approximately million 
we will review goodwill for impairment at the operating division level 
generally  fair value will represent a multiple of ebitda  as defined above in results of operations  or discounted projected future cash flows and will be compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment 
if potential for impairment is identified  the fair value of a division will be measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the division s goodwill 
goodwill impairment will be recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division s goodwill over the implied fair value 
the annual impairment review required by sfas no 
requires extensive uses of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results 
we currently are performing our initial goodwill impairment review at the operating division level to determine the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements 
store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancelable lease payments after the anticipated closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining rent payments on closed stores 
the closed store liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores  which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years 
as of february   closed store lease liabilities totaled million 
for stores we intend to sell  we actively market the stores to potential buyers 
stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect recoverable values 
although we estimate subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the store expected to be closed is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions  the ultimate cost of disposition for these leases and related assets is affected by specific real estate markets  inflation rates  and general economic conditions 
store closings generally are completed within one year after the decision to close 
adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenants and actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known 
any excess store closing liability remaining upon settlement of the obligation is reversed to income in the period that such settlement is determined 
other costs related to closed store locations are reflected in the income statement as operating  general and administrative costs 
reductions in the carrying value of equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store are reflected in the income statement as asset impairment charges in accordance with our policy on asset impairments 
inventory write downs  if any  in connection with store closings  are classified in merchandise costs 
costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred 
store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs  or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose  is adjusted to income in the proper period 
purchase commitments from time to time  we enter into purchase commitments for various resources  including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
upon entering into these commitments  and on a quarterly basis thereafter  we evaluate the company s expectation to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of our normal course of business 
those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in our normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales 
for any commitments for which we do not expect to utilize or take delivery and  as a result  will require net settlement  the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 
benefit plans the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in footnote to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions materially may affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense 
footnote to the consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a last in  first out  lifo  basis or market 
in total  approximately of inventories for and were valued using the lifo method 
approximately of inventories in were valued using the lifo item cost method and approximately were valued using the lifo retail method 
we will evaluate the benefits of converting the remaining divisions to the item cost method in the near future 
cost for the balance of the inventories is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by million at february   and million at february  we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities 
we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the balance sheet date 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point of sale of our products 
discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold 
merchandise costs vendor rebates  credits and promotional allowances that relate to our buying and merchandising activities  including lump sum payments associated with long term contracts  are recorded as a component of merchandise costs as they are earned  in accordance with the underlying agreement 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow information cash from operations was  million in compared to  million in and  million in increased earnings in were offset by increases in the use of cash for working capital 
the increase in was due to an increase in earnings and our efforts to reduce net operating working capital and improve cash flow 
cash used by investing activities was  million in compared to  million in and  million in the increase in was due to increased capital spending 
the decrease in was primarily related to our storing activity and asset acquisitions 
during   and we had capital expenditures excluding acquisitions of  million   million  and  million  respectively 
we spent million for acquisitions during compared to million in and million in we opened  acquired  expanded  or relocated food stores in  food stores in  and food stores in during those same periods  we remodeled   and food stores  respectively 
cash used by financing activities was million in compared to million in financing activities provided cash of million in the decrease in the use of cash in primarily was due to increased borrowings in  offset by increased treasury stock purchases 
the decrease in cash during was due to a decrease in the amount borrowed and an increase in the treasury shares purchased during debt management we have several lines of credit totaling approximately billion 
borrowings of approximately billion at february   primarily commercial paper borrowings  reduce the funds available under our lines of credit 
in addition  we are a party to a million synthetic lease credit facility at february   as further described below in factors affecting liquidity 
total debt  including both the current and long term portions of capital leases  increased million to billion in and decreased million to billion in the increase in was due to an increase in capital spending  stock repurchase programs and working capital 
the decrease in was due to the use of free cash flow to pay down outstanding debt balances 
we purchased a portion of the debt issued by the lenders of some structured financings in an effort to reduce our effective interest expense 
we also prefunded employee benefit costs of million at year end  million at year end  and million at year end if we exclude the debt incurred to make these purchases  which we classify as investments  and the prefunding of employee benefits  our net total debt would have been billion at year end  compared to billion at year end and billion at year end in addition to the available credit mentioned above  as of february   we had available for issuance billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission and declared effective on november  subsequent events on march   we issued million  senior notes due in we also entered into two pay variable interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts totaling million  expiring in factors affecting liquidity we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately to million under our unrated commercial paper cp program 
these borrowings are backed by our credit facilities  and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities 
if our credit rating was to decline below its current level of bbb baa  the ability to borrow under the cp program could be adversely affected  causing us to have to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities 
borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current cp program  depending on the current interest rate environment 
however  because our cp program is unrated  we do not anticipate significant difficulties in continuing our cp program in the event of a downgrade of our rated debt 
although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating  the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected not only by a decrease in our credit rating  but also a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated total interest expense  as defined in the credit facilities 
if our credit rating would be downgraded one level or if our applicable percentage ratio were to decrease from to  at february   to below to  the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would increase at least 
if our year end net debt to consolidated ebitda ratio of to were to be higher than to  or our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus rent expense to consolidated interest expense plus rent expense of to would fall below to  we would be in default of our credit facilities 
the tables below illustrate our significant contractual and other commercial commitments as of year end in millions of dollars contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt capital lease obligations  net of interest operating lease obligations construction commitments unconditional purchase obligations other commercial commitments credit facilities standby letters of credit guarantees of joint venture debt synthetic lease guarantee these borrowings also are included in the long term debt contractual obligation amounts estimated rent payments of approximately million and million in and  respectively  are included in the operating lease contractual obligation amounts our unconditional purchase obligations include purchase commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business  such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities 
these purchase obligations also include management fees for certain facilities operated by third parties 
we maintain three bank credit facilities 
the obligations under the  million senior credit facility are guaranteed by kroger and our material subsidiaries as defined in the facility 
the revolving portion of the senior credit facility is available for general corporate purposes  including the support of fred meyer s commercial paper program 
this agreement expires in february we also maintain an million facility that expires in may  and an million day facility that expires in may we currently are involved in negotiations to refinance the current day facility and the  million senior credit facility with new day and five year facilities in an aggregate amount not expected to exceed billion 
unrated commercial paper borrowings of million and borrowings under money market lines of million at february   have been classified as long term because we expect that these borrowings will be refinanced using the same type of securities 
additionally  we have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis and have presented the amounts as outstanding under the credit facilities 
approximately million of the standby letters of credit are backed by our credit facilities  reducing the borrowing capacity under the credit facilities 
refer to footnote of the financial statements for further details of our debt obligations 
we also maintain in excess of million of surety bonds related primarily to our self insured insurance costs 
these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and general liability exposures  and are made with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our insurance obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments 
these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger  as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs 
however  we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place 
market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and  in some instances  availability of these bonds may become more limited  which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds 
although we do not believe such increased costs or decreased availability significantly would impact our ability to access these surety bonds  if this does become an issue  we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements 
this could both increase our costs and decrease the funds available to us under our credit facilities 
most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co 
and certain of its subsidiaries 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements 
in addition  we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with ownership 
our share of the responsibility for this indebtednesss  should these partnerships be unable to meet their obligations  totals approximately million 
based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of february   it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 
we also are a party to a financing transaction related to properties which were constructed for total costs of approximately million 
under the terms of the financing transaction  which was structured as a synthetic lease  a special purpose trust owns the properties and leases them to subsidiaries of kroger 
the lease has a term of five years  which expires in february we pay a variable lease rate of approximately at february  the synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease and the owner of the special purpose trust has made a substantive residual equity investment 
the transaction  therefore  is accounted for off balance sheet and the related costs are reported as rent expense 
as of february   the assets and liabilities of the special purpose trust primarily were comprised of the properties and million of bank debt used to fund the construction of the properties 
in connection with these financing transactions  we have made a residual value guarantee for the leased property equal to of the financing  or million 
we believe the market values of the property subject to this financing exceeded the residual value guarantee at year end we intend to reduce the synthetic lease facility by approximately million in the first quarter commodity price protection we enter into purchase commitments for various resources  including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
we enter into such commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business 
those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales 
for any commitments in which we do not expect to take delivery and  as a result  will require net settlement  the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 
as more fully described below in recently issued accounting standards  we recorded a pre tax loss of million in the third quarter to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair values of energy contracts that no longer qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales exception 
as of february   these liabilities totaled million 
impact of inflation while management believes that some portion of the increase in sales is due to inflation  it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation because of changes in the types of merchandise sold year to year and other pricing and competitive influences 
we believe there was overall inflation in retail prices 
we experienced deflation in our costs of product of some commodities due to management s success in obtaining synergies and the economies of scale resulting from recent mergers 
in other commodities such as pharmacy and general merchandise  our costs of product increased 
by attempting to control costs and efficiently utilize resources  we strive to minimize the effects of inflation on operations 
other issues on january   we changed our fiscal year end to the saturday nearest january of each year 
this change is disclosed in our current report on form k dated january  we filed separate audited financial statements covering the transition period from january   to january   on a current report on form k dated may  these financial statements included kroger and its consolidated subsidiaries before the merger with fred meyer 
during the transition period we had sales of  million  costs and expenses of  million  and net earnings of million 
we indirectly own a interest in the entity that owns the santee dairy in los angeles  california  and have a product supply agreement with santee that requires us to purchase million gallons of fluid milk and other products annually 
the product supply agreement expires on july  upon acquisition of ralphs food less  santee became excess capacity and a duplicate facility 
the joint venture is managed independently and has a board comprised of an equal number of members from each partner  plus one independent member 
when there is a split vote  this member generally votes with the other partner 
recently issued accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  became effective for kroger as of february  sfas no 
 as amended  defines derivatives  requires that derivatives be carried at fair value on the balance sheet  and provides for hedge accounting when certain conditions are met 
initial adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in kroger recording a liability of million  with a corresponding charge recorded as other comprehensive loss  net of income tax effects 
in accordance with sfas no 
 derivative financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent the hedges are highly effective  are recorded in other comprehensive income  net of related tax effects 
the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge  if any  is recognized in current period earnings 
other comprehensive income is reclassified to current period earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  along with the corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged assets or liabilities  are recorded in current period earnings 
we assess  both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether derivatives used as hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flow of hedged items 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or ceases to be highly effective  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
as of february   we maintain four interest rate swaps and one interest rate collar designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt 
a liability totaling million has been recorded for these instruments 
we also have recorded a liability of million related to a cash flow hedge of electricity purchases  as more fully described below 
hedge ineffectiveness was not material for these instruments during corresponding charges were recorded as other comprehensive loss  net of income tax effects 
in addition  we maintain five interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt 
as of february   a liability totaling million has been recorded to reflect the fair value of these swaps  offset by an asset for the same amount to reflect the impact of the change in interest rates on the fair value of the debt 
during march through may  kroger entered into four separate commitments to purchase electricity from one of our utility suppliers in southern california 
at the inception of these contracts  forecasted electricity usage  which was estimated primarily based on historical energy usage  indicated that it was probable that all of the electricity would be utilized in our operations 
we  therefore  accounted for the contracts in accordance with the normal purchases and normal sales exception under sfas no 
 as amended  and no amounts were recorded in the financial statements related to these purchase commitments 
during the third quarter  we reassessed our projected electricity requirements in southern california 
due primarily to energy conservation programs initiated by kroger in the latter half of  we determined that we no longer needed all of the electricity that we had committed to purchase 
as a result one of the contracts and a portion of a second contract were deemed to exceed expected electricity usage  thereby eliminating the normal purchases and normal sales exception under sfas no 
for those contracts  and requiring the fair value of the contracts to be recorded currently in earnings 
these contracts will continue to be marked to market through current earnings each quarter 
accordingly  we recorded a pre tax third quarter charge of million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of these contracts through december these liabilities totaled million as of february  the remaining portion of the second contract has been re designated as a cash flow hedge of future purchases 
the other two purchase commitments continue to qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception under sfas no 
a tabular summary of our interest rate swaps and energy purchase commitments that are included in the financial statements is included in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  were issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb in late june of sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and sfas no 
became effective for kroger on february  goodwill no longer will be amortized and instead will be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
we estimate that non amortization of goodwill will improve fiscal net earnings by approximately million 
kroger currently is performing its initial goodwill impairment review at the operating division level to determine the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements 
sfas no 
 asset retirement obligations  was issued by the fasb in august of sfas no 
became effective for kroger on february  we currently are analyzing the effect this standard will have on our financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  was issued by the fasb in august of sfas no 
became effective for kroger on february  we expect the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
emerging issues task force eitf issue nos 
 accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales and incentive offers  and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future  and  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  became effective for kroger beginning in the first quarter of these issues address the appropriate accounting for certain vendor contracts and loyalty programs 
we continue to assess the effect these new standards will have on the financial statements 
we expect the adoption of these standards will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
outlook this analysis contains certain forward looking statements about kroger s future performance 
these statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available 
such statements relate to  among other things projected growth in earnings per share eps  working capital reduction  a decline in our net total debt to ebitda ratio  our ability to generate free cash flow  and our strategic growth plan  and are indicated by words or phrases such as comfortable  committed  expects  goal  and similar words or phrases 
these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
our ability to achieve annual eps growth goals will be affected primarily by pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors  including non traditional food retailers  our responses to these actions intended to increase market share  and the success of our strategic growth plan announced in december in addition  kroger s eps growth goals could be affected by increases in product costs  newly opened or consolidated distribution centers  our ability to obtain sales growth from new square footage  competitive activity in the markets in which we operate  changes in our product mix  and changes in laws and regulations 
our ability to reduce our net total debt to ebitda ratio could be adversely affected by our ability to generate sales growth and free cash flow  interest rate fluctuations and other changes in capital market conditions  kroger s stock repurchase activity  unexpected increases in the cost of capital expenditures  acquisitions  and other factors 
the results of our strategic growth plan and our ability to generate free cash flow to the extent expected could be adversely affected if any of the factors identified above negatively impact our operations 
in addition  the timing of the execution of the plan could adversely impact our eps and sales results 
statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations  projections  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties about the general economy  our labor relations  our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements 
our forward looking statements are based on the following assumptions  among others  and if these assumptions prove to be incorrect  our actual results may be adversely affected we expect to reduce net operating working capital as compared to the third quarter of by million by the end of the third quarter we define net operating working capital as current operating assets  before lifo credit  less current operating liabilities 
we do not intend the presentation of net operating working capital to be an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance 
rather we believe this presentation is relevant to an assessment of our operating financial performance for working capital 
as of the end of fiscal  net operating working capital has increased million  compared to the fourth quarter of  but decreased million compared to the fourth quarter of a calculation of net operating working capital based on our definition as of the fourth quarter  the fourth quarter and the fourth quarter of is provided in the following table fourth quarter fourth quarter fourth quarter in millions cash receivables fifo inventory operating prepaid and other assets accounts payable operating accrued liabilities prepaid veba net working capital we obtain sales growth from new square footage  as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 
during the next two years  kroger plans to increase square footage by year over year 
we expect combination stores to increase our sales per customer by including numerous specialty departments  such as pharmacies  natural food products  seafood shops  floral shops  bakeries and fuel centers 
we believe the combination store format will allow us to withstand continued competition from other food retailers  supercenters  mass merchandisers  club or warehouse stores  drug stores and restaurants 
on december   kroger outlined a strategic growth plan that will support additional investment in core business to grow sales and increase market share 
we intend to achieve identical supermarket store sales growth of to above product cost inflation and to reduce merchandising and operating  general and administrative costs by more than million over the next two years 
we expect approximately two thirds of this reduction will be achieved by the end of fiscal as part of the plan to reduce operating  general and administrative costs  we have identified approximately  positions to be eliminated and have merged one division into two adjacent marketing areas 
as part of the plan  we have established a long term  sustainable annual earnings per share eps growth target of  before one time items  beginning in fiscal for fiscal and  we expect annual eps growth of  before one time items 
we also estimate that adoption of sfas no 
will improve fiscal net earnings by approximately million beyond the expected growth rate of 
kroger estimates free cash flow to be approximately million in fiscal the estimate reflects capital spending of billion  which is consistent with prior plans  and a net working capital reduction of million 
we believe the total cost of the strategic growth plan will be approximately million to million pre tax  a reduction of million from our original estimate in december in the fourth quarter  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million primarily for severance agreements associated with this plan 
most of this severance will be paid in capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition as well as our emphasis on self development and ownership of store real estate  and on logistics and technology improvements 
the continued capital spending in technology focusing on improved store operations  logistics  manufacturing procurement  category management  merchandising and buying practices  should reduce merchandising costs and operating  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales 
we expect our capital expenditures for fiscal to total billion  excluding acquisitions 
we intend to use the combination of free cash flows from operations  including reductions in working capital  and borrowings under credit facilities to finance capital expenditure requirements 
if determined preferable  we may fund capital expenditure requirements by mortgaging facilities  entering into sale leaseback transactions  or by issuing additional debt or equity 
based on current operating results  we believe that operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities  will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future 
we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
we have identified the following uncertainties about the future that could have an adverse effect on our actual results a decline in the generation of sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans  share repurchase programs and general operating activities could cause our growth to slow significantly and may cause us to miss our earnings targets  because we obtain some of our sales growth from new square footage 
the grocery retailing industry continues to experience fierce competition from other grocery retailers  supercenters  club or warehouse stores  mass merchandise stores  and drug stores 
our ability to maintain our current success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and continue to reduce operating expenses 
the competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales  thus reducing margins 
while we believe our opportunities for sustained  profitable growth are considerable  unanticipated actions of competitors could impact our share of sales and net income 
changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements  and environmental laws may have a material impact on our financial statements 
changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions  including the rate of inflation  population growth  and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores 
this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth 
general economic changes may also effect the shopping habits of our customers  which could affect sales and earnings 
changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators 
for example  we have added and will continue to add supermarket fuel centers 
since gasoline is a low profit margin item with high sales dollars  we expect to see our gross profit margins decrease as we sell more gasoline 
although this negatively affects our gross profit margin  gasoline is expected to provide a positive effect on ebitda and net earnings 
we are party to collective bargaining agreements with local unions representing approximately  employees 
during we negotiated labor contracts without any material work stoppages 
typical agreements are three to five years in duration and  as agreements expire  we expect to enter new collective bargaining agreements 
in  collective bargaining agreements will expire  including the southern california teamsters and dallas store employees 
we also have significant agreements expiring that cover store employees in northeast indiana  arkansas  oregon and north carolina 
we cannot be certain that agreements will be reached without work stoppage 
a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of stores could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired and achieve operating improvements at those companies will affect our operations 
we retain a portion of the exposure for our workers compensation and general liability claims 
it is possible that these claims may cause significant expenditures that would affect the operating cash flows of the company 
our capital expenditures could fall outside of the expected range if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores  if development costs exceed those budgeted  or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget 
adverse weather conditions could increase the costs that our suppliers charge for our products  or may decrease the customer demand for certain products 
additionally  increases in the costs of inputs  such as utility costs or raw material costs  could negatively impact financial ratios and net earnings 
although we currently operate only in the united states  civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods 
if we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers  our gross margin and ebitda will suffer 
interest rate fluctuation and other capital market conditions may cause variability in earnings 
although we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to financial risks  we are still exposed to interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions 
we cannot fully foresee the effects of the general economic downturn upon kroger s business 
we have assumed the economic situation and competitive situations will not change significantly for and other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information 
accordingly  actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
we limit our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt  and interest rate swaps 
our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates 
to do this  we use the following guidelines i use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure  ii limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of billion or less  iii include no leveraged products  and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status 
during the third quarter  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates 
maturity dates of interest rate swap arrangements match those of the underlying debt 
these agreements  which mature from to  involve the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
variable rates for our agreements are based on three month us dollar libor and are reset on a quarterly basis 
the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense 
the notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap arrangements were approximately billion at february  these agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 
also during the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to cash flows resulting from potential increases in interest rates by effectively converting a portion of our debt from variable to fixed rates 
these agreements  which mature in and  involve the exchange of variable rate payments for fixed rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
variable rates for our agreements are based on three month us dollar libor and are reset on a quarterly basis 
the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense 
the notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap arrangements were approximately million at february  these agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
annually  we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines 
in addition  our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on at least an annual basis 
the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 
the table below provides information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio 
the amount shown for each year represents the contractual maturities of long term debt  excluding capital leases  and the outstanding notional amount of interest rate derivatives 
interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments 
the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on libor using the forward yield curve as of february  the fair value column includes the fair value of those debt instruments for which it is reasonably possible to calculate a fair value and the fair value of our interest rate derivatives as of february  refer to footnotes and to the consolidated financial statements expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate it was not reasonably possible to calculate a fair value for million of fixed rate debt 
average notional amounts outstanding thereafter total fair value in millions interest rate derivatives variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate interest rate collar the interest rate collar is reset based on the three month libor with the following impact if the three month libor is less than or equal to  we pay for that three month period  if the three month libor is greater than and less than or equal to  we pay the actual interest rate for that three month period  if the three month libor is greater than and less than  we pay for that three month period  and if the three month libor is greater than or equal to  we pay the actual interest rate for that three month period
