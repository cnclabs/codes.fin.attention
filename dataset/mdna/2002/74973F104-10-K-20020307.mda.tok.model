item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are building and managing industry specific private networks for businesses to communicate with their vendors and customers via bi directional  satellite delivered internet connections 
our core services and products include remote high speed internet access  data delivery  high quality video  and networking services which can allow businesses to provide e business services  such as merchant payment  in store audio and video  employee benefits administration  employee training  and related services to their vendors and customers 
we are initially focusing our efforts on building an industry specific network for the collision industry 
once fully developed we intend to contribute the assets necessary to conduct the business to a currently inactive  owned subsidiary 
we began developing a new managed browser technology as an important component of our advertising supported network serving the education market school business during although the new browser was intended to replace the browser then installed in the schools in connection with our school business  it was never deployed in that environment 
due to changes in our school business  which led to its discontinuation  we decided to focus our efforts toward becoming a provider of satellite based services to vertical markets 
accordingly  we are seeking to utilize the managed browser technology that was in development for the now discontinued school business in our commercial business  including the starband latin america business described below 
our solution utilizes always on satellite technology  which delivers technology tools and applications to small and medium sized business entities 
we customize our managed browser technology  or rvista tm for each network to allow internet access  in an industry specific managed desktop environment  for conducting business transactions or viewing web based content and training  and providing e business services 
we expect to generate revenues by charging end users for internet access and other services  and by charging suppliers for the dedicated connection  e commerce services and advertising access to their customers 
in october  we announced that we were shifting our business focus and resources to pursue our current business  which we initiated in july prior to that announcement  our principal focus was on building the school business 
operations of the school business commenced in september and we began offering sponsorships through our proprietary network in december over the next two years  we built one of the largest broadband networks dedicated to education in the united states 
this network was designed primarily for students aged to provide a rich media computer experience that was free to schools and easy to use 
we provided each school participating in the network from to multimedia personal computers with monitors  a satellite ready server  a laser printer and satellite based broadband access to the internet 
in addition  we offered a proprietary  easy to use browser interface providing access to the internet  over  pre selected and indexed third party educational web sites  educational tools  and other aggregated content and services 
since commencement of operations of the school business  our advertising based revenue model for the educational market was targeted by federal and state legislative initiatives supported by persons seeking to minimize advertising in schools 
in october  as a result of these initiatives  the negative publicity generated by persons opposed to advertising and the gathering of demographic information in schools  increasing expenses associated with the maintenance and servicing of our school network  and our uncertainty regarding future sponsorship revenues  we decided that we would no longer deliver paid commercial messages directed at students  would end the advertised supported business model and would discontinue the installation of free computer labs in schools 
the school business operations  including the operations of our efundraising subsidiary  which comprised all of our revenues and a significant portion of our assets and expenses  are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued 
we have disposed of most of our education network through a sale of the assets and operations 
unless otherwise noted  all references to customers and clients relate to our current business operations and not the discontinued school business 
in connection with our change in business focus  we have undergone significant reductions in force during these actions  combined with attrition  have reduced our headcount approximately from employees at december  to employees as of december  total severance costs associated with these actions equaled approximately  for the twelve months of on april   we entered into an agreement with gilat to home latin america holland nv and gilat concerning our acquisition of gilat s starband latin america business 
see item for further details 
gilat established starband latin america as an entity focused on providing satellite based telephone and high speed internet access to small business and home office customers in latin america 
we also expect to offer to exchange up to  shares of our common stock for a combination of cash and gilat ordinary shares 
the starband acquisition  and the other transactions contemplated by the second amended acquisition agreement  are subject to the approval by our stockholders 
the company expects to hold a stockholder s meeting to vote on these matters some time in the first or second quarter of on april   the company  gilat  and the spacenet subsidiary of gilat entered into an agreement pursuant to which the company would issue approximately million shares of its common stock to spacenet or its affiliate designee in full satisfaction of the company s outstanding obligations to spacenet 
on may   that transaction was completed 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address the estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations and asset impairment recognition 
while the estimates and judgements associated with the application of these policies may be affected by different assumptions and conditions  the company believes the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate under the circumstances 
results of operations we believe that  due to the majority of our operations being deemed discontinued  period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risk  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties 
revenues we expect to generate revenue from a number of sources end users of our industry specific networks and vendors to those community of users  as well as end users of the starband latin america business 
we believe that end users will pay a fee for broadband internet access  industry specific content and other bundled products and services 
additionally  we believe vendors will pay for the right to occupy a priority position on our networks in order to gain special access to those customers  particularly considering that the network will provide  we believe  an efficient means to distribute training  new product and other vendor services and products 
revenues from these sources will be recognized as the services are rendered 
to date  we have generated no revenue from our continuing operations 
revenue from our school business  which comprised of our revenue  is not classified as such because that business has been classified as discontinued 
rather  it has been applied as a reduction in the loss from discontinued operations 
cost of revenues we anticipate that upon maturation of our continuing operations  cost of revenue will consist primarily of depreciation on network equipment  including computers placed at user sites  and to a lesser degree  the cost of administering our satellite communications network 
the costs associated with this form of telecommunication include the cost of land based equipment  or earth segment  such as the satellite dishes  hubs  send receive cards located inside the network servers and land based phone service and the cost of the link to and from the satellite  or space segment 
we expect to provide much of our earth segment to customers by purchasing or renting satellite dishes  hubs and send receive cards for our network servers 
we expect to purchase the space segment from spacenet  a wholly owned subsidiary of gilat 
our cost of revenue will vary based on the number of locations we serve within our networks 
in the twelve months ended december  and in all prior periods  there were no costs of revenues from continuing operations 
all such costs were attributable to our discontinued school business operations 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for continuing operations for the years ended december  and were  and  representing costs of personnel and overhead associated with initiating our new industry specific private network business 
in  we were just starting to develop our new industry specific private network business 
in there were no sales and marketing expenses associated with continuing operations 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  representing costs of personnel and overhead associated with initiating our new industry specific private network business 
included in these general and administrative costs were legal costs  and consulting costs  relating to the acquisition agreement entered into on april  by the company  gilat to home latin america holland n 
v  and gilat  the company s major shareholder  amounting to approximately  for the twelve months ended december  the pending acquisition of starband latin america by rstar is a combination of two entities under common control 
as such  all transaction costs have been expensed as incurred 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  amounted to  in general and administrative expenses for continuing operations totaled  and was comprised largely of depreciation on corporate equipment not directly related to the school business 
research and development research and development expenses for our continuing operations for the year ended december  were  representing costs of personnel and overhead associated with the development of our new industry specific private network business  the majority of which related to furthering the development of our managed browser for use in that business 
in  research and development expenses were  as we were starting to develop our new industry specific private network business 
we are seeking to utilize the managed browser technology initially developed for our school business to further develop industry specific private networks in a commercial environment under the rvista tm brand name 
in there were no research and development expenses associated with continuing operations 
to date  we have not capitalized any software development costs under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
under which certain software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the related products 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model 
to date  costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant  and all such software development costs have been charged to research and development expense as incurred 
amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred compensation for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively  relating to personnel associated with initiating our new industry specific private network business 
these amounts have been included in sales and marketing expenses  as  and  general and administrative expenses  as  and  and research and development expenses as  and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
in all amortization of deferred compensation  amounting to  was attributable to personnel who were dedicated to operating the discontinued education business 
amortization of deferred compensation relating to personnel operating the discontinued education business in amounted to  and such expense was included in the loss from discontinued operations figures in that year 
the decline in overall expense in was largely due to the expiration of the amortization periods of earlier grants and the departure of several executives who were beneficiaries 
no grants that would generate deferred compensation were made during the year ended december  deferred stock compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the options  generally to years from the date of grant  or the performance period for various warrants we granted using a graded vesting method 
all the remaining deferred compensation as of december  in the amount of  will be amortized over the next months 
interest income and expense interest income totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in income from to was due to the investment of the proceeds of our public offering late in in interest bearing securities and the decrease in income from to was due to diminishing cash balances available for investment  as significant proceeds from our initial public offering were used late in and throughout in support of school business operations 
although that business was discontinued late in lease obligations related to computer equipment purchased in support of the business continued to consume cash in interest expense totaled  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in expense from to was associated with the substantial capital lease obligations incurred to finance computer equipment purchases in support of the school business 
the decrease in expense from to was associated with the settlement of the spacenet lease obligations in april which was our largest lessor 
interest expense of  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively was with spacenet  a related party 
income taxes 
there has been no provision for federal or state income taxes for any period since inception due to our net operating losses 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire beginning in fiscal year if not utilized 
utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state tax code provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
management has established a valuation allowance and  accordingly  no benefit has been recognized for our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
the net valuation allowance increased by approximately million during the year ended december  we believe that  based on a number of factors  the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of the deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance has been recorded 
these factors include our history of net losses since inception and expected near term future losses 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on actual and forecasted operating results 
loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december   we reported a loss from discontinued operations of  which was a result of a  charge recorded to cover principally the cost of excess space segment bandwidth consumed by the school business that resolved a discrepancy between spacenet and the company and  impairment charges to reflect a revised estimate of the net proceeds to be obtained from the sale of school business assets 
partially offsetting these charges were actual expenses that were lower than the original estimates for which a reserve was established in december at december  all remaining school business assets have been sold 
for the year ended december  we reported a loss from discontinued operations of  of this loss  million reflects the cost  net of million of revenue  of deploying and operating the advertiser supported school network 
the other million is the estimated loss on disposal of that network 
this is comprised of asset impairment charges  totaling million and estimated future net operating losses from january  to the june  expected disposal date 
severance and other estimated expenses comprise the million remainder 
for the year ended december  we reported a loss from discontinued operations of  this reflects the cost  net of million of revenue  of developing  deploying and operating the advertiser supported school network 
liquidity and capital resources on april   the company entered into an agreement to issue  shares of its common stock to gilat satellite networks holland bv spacenet s affiliate assignee in full satisfaction of the company s outstanding obligations to spacenet of approximately  these shares were issued on may  on september   gilat and the company announced revisions to a series of related transactions that will result in the acquisition by the company of gilat s starband latin america business 
in consideration for such acquisition  the company will issue to gilat  or its designee  approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
additionally  the company announced a tender offer to acquire  in exchange for up to million in cash and up to  ordinary shares of gilat  up to  shares or approximately percent of the company s common stock not held by gilat and its corporate affiliates 
the tender offer is conditioned upon the purchase by the company of gilat s starband latin america business 
we have contractual obligations totaling approximately million 
the majority of these relate to capital and operating leases 
the capital leases are principally for computer equipment deployed in the now discontinued school business while the operating leases are primarily related to office space 
additionally  we have an employment agreement with our chief executive officer and severance agreements with a number of other senior executives that provide for substantial payments if their employment is terminated  as is expected upon the acquisition of starband latin america 
payments due by period s less than more than contractual obligations total year year capital lease obligations   operating leases employment and severance agreements   total contractual cash obligations   we believe that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including the cash that we expect to pay to our stockholders in the exchange offer  for the next months based on our current business plan and that of starband latin america 
however  if by acquisition or other means  opportunities are presented to deploy our products and services more rapidly than currently planned  we may seek to raise additional funds 
additionally  we may require additional capital to develop new satellite based private networks  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary technologies  or respond to unanticipated developments 
we may seek to raise additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic financial and business relationships  bank debt  lease financing  or otherwise 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of the company owned by existing stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution  and these equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to deploy or enhance our networks  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated developments  which could severely harm our business 
risk factors investors should carefully consider the risks described below 
we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  including our consolidated financial statements and other notes 
we have an unproven business model and a limited operating history 
because we discontinued our principal business building an advertiser supported network serving the education market and we have not completed the development of our industry specific private network business  we have no operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
our revenue and income potential are unproven and our business model is unique and evolving 
we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
an investor in our common stock must carefully consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development  as well as the risks we face due to our participation in a new and rapidly evolving market 
our business strategy may not be successful and it may not successfully overcome these risks 
our business model is changing and future revenue growth will suffer if we fail to attract and grow our sponsorship and user base 
the success of our business will depend on our ability to generate revenue by attracting sponsors and subscribers for the industry specific private networks we seek to develop and deploy 
if we are unable to rapidly deploy our networks to a large number of fee based business customers  our ability to generate revenue and implement our strategy will be severely limited 
users may find that our networks features and content are not sufficiently compelling to continue regular use  or may turn to other internet providers for such services such as broadband internet connectivity  software applications  industry specific content  and e commerce business solutions 
if we are not able to demonstrate to sponsors that our networks have an active and growing user base  sponsors may choose not to enter into sponsorship agreements with us and our revenues generated from sponsorships would suffer 
we have incurred substantial losses and anticipate continued losses 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for the period of inception through december   which losses resulted primarily from costs related to developing our discontinued education network business  deploying the network to schools and developing content and features for the network 
we have not achieved profitability 
we expect to have continued net losses and negative cash flows 
the size of these net losses will depend  in part  on revenues from our sponsors and subscribers of the industry specific private networks we intend to provide  and on the level of our expenses 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability 
it is possible that we will never achieve profitability  and even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if we do not achieve or sustain profitability in the future  then we may be unable to continue our operations 
we expect our quarterly financial results to fluctuate and our recent shift to our current business limits management s ability to predict revenues and expenses precisely 
our quarterly and annual operating results have varied in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results include the factors described in the accompanying subheadings 
to respond to these and other factors  we may need to make business decisions that could impact our quarterly operating results 
most of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels in connection with our current business 
as a result  if total revenues for a particular quarter are below our expectations we may not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter 
this revenue shortfall might then have a disproportionate effect on our expected operating results for that quarter 
consequently  management believes that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and should not be viewed as indicators of our future performance in connection with our current business 
in addition  during future periods our quarterly or annual operating results may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this case the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 
following the starband acquisition and the exchange offer  gilat will be able to exercise total influence over rstar 
currently  gilat beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
upon completion of the starband acquisition and the exchange offer  gilat s beneficial ownership of our common stock will increase to approximately  assuming that gilat is issued the maximum number of shares upon rstar s exercise of the option for gilat ordinary shares and under the provisions regarding the additional shares that may be issued to gilat 
pursuant to the second amended acquisition agreement  lance mortensen  charles appleby and michael arnouse will tender their resignations from our board of directors at the closing of the starband acquisition 
we expect gilat to nominate five nominees  including two current gilat nominees  at our stockholder s meeting 
gilat will  therefore  be able to exercise total control over all such matters as the election of our directors and other fundamental corporate transactions such as mergers  asset sales and the sale of rstar 
additionally  pursuant to the acquisition agreement  the board of directors is proposing certain changes to our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation that  as permitted by the delaware general corporation law  will allow gilat to undertake certain actions without calling and holding a special meeting of stockholders 
in addition  the board of directors intends to propose another amendment to our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation that will permit gilat  as our majority stockholder  to call a special meeting of rstar stockholders at any time 
accordingly  the influence of our other stockholders will be limited and may depress our stock price 
also  we cannot assure you that the interests of gilat will not  from time to time  conflict with your interests as a stockholder 
we may not realize any benefits from the transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement 
achieving the benefits of the transactions as reflected in the acquisition agreement will depend  in part  on the integration of starband latin america s business  technology  operations and personnel into our operations 
the integration of starband latin america into rstar will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
among the challenges involved in this integration are i demonstrating to our customers  suppliers  and strategic partners that the acquisition will not result in adverse changes in client service standards or business focus  ii persuading personnel that rstar s and starband latin america s business cultures are compatible  iii retaining key personnel and addressing any adverse changes in business focus 
we do not have experience in integrating operations on the scale represented by the acquisition  and it is not certain that we will be able to successfully integrate starband latin america into our operations in a timely manner or at all  or that any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will be realized 
failure to do so could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have no previous experience in the latin american market and our ability to be successful in that market is uncertain 
through the acquisition  we will be expanding our business operations into the delivery of satellite based telephony and internet access services in latin america 
we have no previous experience in the latin american market  and we have limited meaningful historical financial and operational data upon which we can base projected revenues and planned operating expenses and upon which you may evaluate our prospects in latin america 
the latin america satellite based telephony and internet access market is an untested market for us and the results of these operations are uncertain and unpredictable 
as a company attempting to expand its business in the satellite based telephony and internet access market in latin america  we face risks relating to our ability to implement our business plan  including our ability to continue to develop and upgrade our technology  our ability to maintain and develop customer and supplier relationships  obtain key technology and the necessary governmental and regulatory approvals  consents and licenses 
we may not adequately address these risks  and if we do not  we may not be able to implement our business plan as we intend 
our business model contemplates that we will generate revenues  through wholesale sales to latin american internet service providers  dth tv companies and other service providers 
the revenues may not materialize if we fail to implement our strategy for attracting wholesale customers 
you should consider our business and prospects in light of the heightened risks and unexpected expenses and problems we may face in an emerging market place 
an investor in our common stock must carefully consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that are still developing their business plan  as well as the risks we face due to our participation in a new and rapidly evolving market in latin america 
our business strategy may not be successful and it may not successfully overcome these risks 
if the conditions in the acquisition agreement are not met  the transactions may not occur 
in addition to rstar stockholder approval of the acquisition agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby  several other conditions must be satisfied or waived to complete the transactions 
we cannot assure you that each of the conditions will be satisfied 
if the conditions are not satisfied or waived  the transactions will not occur or will be delayed  and we may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the acquisition 
for example  if either party s representations and warranties are not materially true and correct at the closing or either party suffers a material adverse change in its financial condition prior to closing the acquisition  the other party is not required to close the transactions 
failure to complete the transactions could negatively affect our operating results 
if the transactions are not completed for any reason  we may experience a number of adverse consequences  including the following the market price of our common stock may decline  an adverse reaction by our investors and potential investors could adversely affect future financing opportunities  we may be required under certain circumstances to pay gilat a termination fee and reimburse gilat and gth latin america for any of their out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition agreement and the transactions  and our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the starband latin america acquisition 
in connection with the starband latin america acquisition  we will issue new shares of rstar common stock to gilat and certain of its subsidiaries that will dilute our results of operations on a per share basis 
this dilution could reduce the market price of our common stock unless and until we achieve revenue growth or cost savings and other business economies sufficient to offset the effect of the issuance of additional shares 
additionally  the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the transactions if the integration of rstar and starband latin america is unsuccessful  we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the starband latin america acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or investors  or the effect of the starband latin america acquisition on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts or investors 
if we terminate the acquisition agreement  we may be unable to find or effect any business combination with another suitable partner 
if the acquisition agreement is terminated and our board of directors determines to seek another acquisition or business combination  there can be no assurance that we will be able to find a partner willing to enter into an equivalent or more favorable arrangement  and  as a result  our operations may be adversely affected 
these factors could adversely affect our stock price as they may restrict our ability to pursue alternative business combinations 
because we do not intend to pay dividends  you may lose the entire amount of your investment 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
subject to certain limited exceptions  we expect to retain our future earnings  if any  for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
therefore  you will not receive any funds without selling your shares 
under the acquisition agreement  gilat has agreed not to permit rstar to pay or declare any dividends or other distributions  other than the special cash distributions  for the longer of x one year following the closing of the starband acquisition or y the date on which rstar s obligation to make the special cash distributions has been satisfied in full or otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement 
further  pursuant to the acquisition agreement  we expect to amend our certificate of incorporation to provide that  until such time as rstar has satisfied its obligation to make the special cash distributions  it shall not be permitted to declare or pay any dividend or other distributions on any of its capital stock other than rstar common stock and dividends payable in the form of additional shares of rstar capital stock 
we cannot assure you that you will receive a return on your investment when you sell your shares of rstar common stock or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment 
nasdaq has sent us notices regarding the possibility of delisting our common stock 
on february  we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market that pursuant to market place rule a our stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market because the stock failed to close above a minimum bid price of during the preceding consecutive trading days 
pursuant to market place rule e  we have until may  to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirements 
a common course of action for companies attempting to maintain their listing by ensuring a bid price in excess of is the institution of a reverse stock split 
at present  we have made no decision with respect to this course of action but will continue to evaluate this alternative in light of all other options  including accepting a delisting determination 
a reverse stock split could negatively impact the value of our stock by allowing additional downward pressure on the stock price as our relative value becomes greater following the reverse split 
that is to say  the stock  at our new  higher price per share has farther to fall and therefore more room for investors to short or otherwise trade the value of the stock downward 
on february   we also received a notice from the nasdaq national market which stated that pursuant to market place rules e and g  unless we hold our stockholders meeting by march   our common stock would be delisted 
nasdaq has sent us a notice of its intention to review the decision of a nasdaq listing qualifications panel that determined that our stock would not be delisted from the nasdaq national market on january  we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market informing us that the nasdaq listing and hearing review council review council called for a review of the december  decision of the nasdaq listing qualifications panel listing panel to permit our continued inclusion on the nasdaq national market  notwithstanding the view of the listing panel that  under nasdaq rules i c and i c ii  a vote of our stockholders was necessary in connection with our debt for equity swap with spacenet inc at the time of the consummation of that transaction with spacenet inc  stockholders owning a majority of our common stock advised us that they were in favor of the transaction  and we believed that no formal stockholder approval was required in connection with the debt for equity transaction 
the listing panel s decision  which we received on december   followed a hearing conducted on august  concerning our compliance with nasdaq s rules  including the minimum bid price rule 
the nasdaq listing and hearing review council advised us that it will likely issue its decision following its meeting in march our shares of common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which would impair their liquidity 
if the shares of our common stock are delisted from the nasdaq national market  their liquidity will be impaired 
though we may decide  among other alternatives  to seek trading of our common stock on the over the counter bulletin board  or otc market  if our common stock is delisted  the otc market provides substantially less liquidity than the nasdaq national market  and stocks traded on the otc market generally trade with larger spreads between the bid and the ask price  which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
also  if we decide to seek trading of our common stock on the otc market  our common stock would be subject to rules under the securities exchange act of  which impose additional requirements on broker dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and to persons other than accredited investors 
in this context the term accredited investors includes individuals with a net worth in excess of  or an annual income exceeding  or  together with their spouses 
for transactions covered by such rules  a broker dealer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must have received the purchaser s written consent prior to the sale 
this could negatively affect the ability of broker dealers to sell shares of our common stock and further impair the liquidity of our common stock 
if delisted  our shares of common stock may be characterized as penny stocks  which may severely harm their liquidity 
the sec has adopted regulations which define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than per share or with an exercise price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
for any transaction involving a penny stock  unless exempt  these rules require delivery  prior to any transaction in a penny stock  of a disclosure schedule relating to the penny stock market 
disclosure is also required to be made about current quotations for the securities and about commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative 
finally  broker dealers must send monthly statements to purchasers of penny stocks disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks 
although we are not currently considered a penny stock  the foregoing penny stock restrictions will not apply to our shares of common stock if they continue to be listed on the nasdaq national market  certain price and volume information is publicly available about our shares on a current and continuing basis  and we meet certain minimum net tangible assets or average revenue criteria 
our common stock may not qualify for an exemption from the penny stock restrictions 
if our shares of common stock were subject to the rules on penny stocks  the liquidity of our common stock would be severely harmed 
our stock price has been highly volatile and has experienced a significant decline  particularly because our business depends on the internet  and may continue to be volatile and decline 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and is expected to continue to do so in the future  as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many technology companies  particularly telecommunication and internet related companies  and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
our methods of generating revenues are new and largely untested 
the success of our business will depend on our ability to generate revenue 
prior to discontinuing our school business  we generated of our revenues from that business 
we have not yet begun to generate any revenue from our new business  and because our methods of generating revenue are new and largely untested we may generate lower revenues than we expect 
further  if we are unable to generate multiple new sources of revenue  our future revenue growth will suffer 
currently  we expect to receive the majority of our revenue from suppliers to participants in industries for which we plan to provide private networks  who will be charged for dedicated connections  and for e commerce and advertising access to their customers  network services  including marketing and profit sharing fees  and fees paid by network end users 
the success of our initiatives to become a leading provider of satellite based network services to specific industries depends in part on our ability to adapt our experience in building a satellite based network for our discontinued school business to other markets and those markets acceptance of our products and services  and more generally upon the adoption of the internet as a medium for commerce by a broad base of customers and our users 
if these markets fail to develop or develop more slowly than expected  or if our products and services do not achieve market acceptance  our revenue generated from our new network business will be lower than expected 
we rely heavily on our key partners  who are related parties  and if they terminate their strategic alliances with us or if the arrangements fail to meet our objectives  we may experience difficulty or delays in installing and maintaining our planned networks and our revenue growth may suffer 
we rely heavily on our strategic alliance relationships with gilat and its wholly owned subsidiary  spacenet 
our agreements with gilat and spacenet involve many aspects of our business  including deployment and operation of our planned industry specific networks 
our arrangements with gilat and spacenet are complex and as a result  there are many risks related to these arrangements  including some that we may not have foreseen 
it is difficult to assess the likelihood of occurrence of these risks  including the lack of success of the overall arrangements to meet the parties objectives 
if we fail to maintain these relationships  as anticipated  or if our partners do not perform to our expectations  the performance of our networks  and our ability to generate revenues  may be harmed 
we are dependent on related parties to deploy our planned networks to business enterprises and support it once installed 
we have used  and plan to continue to use  related parties such as gilat and spacenet to install and support our planned networks in business entities 
in the past we have experienced difficulties resulting from the failure of third parties to manage successfully the wide scale deployment of our discontinued education network in a school environment 
such failures  if duplicated in our new network business  would result in delays in the scheduled deployment of our networks and could limit or eliminate revenue generated from sponsorships  e commerce and network services 
we also rely on related parties to provide the majority of support necessary to maintain our networks once installed 
any inability to maintain or delays to the maintenance of this equipment would lead to lower revenue generated from sponsorships  e commerce and network services 
our varied sales cycles could harm our results of operations if forecasted sales are delayed or do not occur 
the length of time between the date of initial contact with a potential customer or sponsor and the execution of a contract with the potential customer or sponsor may vary significantly and may depend on the nature of the arrangement 
furthermore  contracting with potential sponsors is subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including potential sponsors adoption of our industry specific networks  which are a relatively new advertising medium  as an acceptable use of those sponsors budgets  potential sponsors or customers budgetary constraints  potential sponsors internal acceptance reviews  and the possibility of cancellation or delay of projects by sponsors 
during any given sales cycle  we may expend substantial funds and management resources and yet not obtain sponsorship or subscriber revenue 
our results of operations for a particular period may suffer if sales to sponsors and subscribers forecasted in a particular period are delayed or do not otherwise occur 
government regulation affecting our business strategy could harm our business 
laws and regulations directly applicable to communications or commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
these laws or regulations may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  online content regulation  user privacy  taxation and the quality of products and services 
in addition  the courts have not yet significantly interpreted these new laws  and consequently their applicability and reach are not defined 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership  copyright  defamation  obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain and developing 
we may be subject to claims that our services violate such laws 
governmental regulations may prevent us from choosing our business partners or restrict our activities following the starband acquisition 
for example  a particular latin american country may decide that high speed data networks used to provide access to the internet should be made available generally to internet service providers and may require us to provide our wholesale service to any internet service providers that request it  including entities that compete with us 
additionally  relevant zoning ordinances may restrict the installation of satellite antennas  which might also reduce market demand for our service 
governmental authorities may also increase regulation regarding the potential radiation hazard posed by transmitting earth station satellite antennas emissions of radio frequency energy  which may negatively impact our business plan and revenues 
any new legislation or regulation  particularly in the united states of america or in latin america or the application of existing laws and regulations  related to the internet could impose significant restrictions  requirements or additional costs on our business  require us to change our operating methods  business strategy  or subject us to additional liabilities and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we may suffer foreign exchange rate losses 
following the starband acquisition  our international revenues and expenses will be denominated in local currency 
therefore  a weakening of other currencies compared to the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and could negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities  although in some instances we will reserve the right to engage in such activities 
we have not yet  but may in the future  experience significant foreign currency transaction losses  especially to the extent that we do not engage in currency hedging 
the success of our international operations following the starband acquisition is dependent on many factors beyond our control which could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and services in latin america and our profitability 
following the starband acquisition  our international operations in latin america will increase our exposure to international laws and regulations 
if we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations  which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes  we could incur unexpected costs  delays and potential litigation 
for example  the governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our products and services or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
in addition  foreign countries may confiscate our products or impose tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  any of which could make it more difficult for us to conduct our business 
in addition  our international operations in latin america are also subject other factors beyond our control  such as political and economic instability  including the current political instability in argentina 
our expansion in foreign markets will require us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries 
our overall success as an international business will depend  in part  upon our ability to succeed in differing economic  social and political conditions 
we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we expect to do business following the completion of the starband acquisition 
because we will operate in foreign countries  we may face liability under the us foreign corrupt practices act and other regulations 
following the starband acquisition  we will be subject to additional provisions the us foreign corrupt practices act  which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business 
as a result  we may be exposed to liability under this act as a result of past or future actions taken with or without our knowledge by our agents  strategic partners or other intermediaries 
for many of our activities  we are also subject to the us foreign export control laws 
barriers to international expansion could limit our future growth 
expansion of our latin american operations following the starband acquisition will require significant management attention and financial resources 
expenses incurred in expanding international operations might never result in increased revenue 
we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  such as difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in recruiting and training an international staff  difficulties in entering into strategic relationships with companies in international markets  language and cultural differences  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  and seasonal business activity in certain parts of the world 
any of these factors could seriously harm our international operations and  consequently  our business 
we are dependent on our network infrastructure  and in particular on satellites and satellite transmission technology  and any failure of our networks would harm our operations 
we decided to withdraw from the education market and  instead  emphasize our goal of becoming a leading provider of satellite based private networks for specific industries 
our network infrastructure may not be able to support the demands this growth may place on it and our performance and reliability may decline 
we experienced interruptions in service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout our network infrastructure in our former school business  and we may in the future experience such interruptions in service and other delays 
if these outages or delays occur frequently in the future  use of our planned networks and their growth could be impaired 
our network operations center and our communications and other computer hardware  are also subject to disruptions which are beyond our control and for which we may not have adequate insurance 
fire  floods  earthquakes  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage our communications hardware and other network operations 
each user of our planned networks will be connected to our networks through a satellite link 
the complete or partial loss of a satellite used to transmit data to network subscribers could affect the performance of our networks 
orbiting satellites are subject to the risk of failing prematurely due to mechanical failure  collision with objects in space or an inability to maintain proper orbit 
any such loss of the use of a satellite could prevent us from delivering our services 
this interruption in services would continue until either a substitute satellite is placed into orbit  or until our services are moved to a different satellite 
moving to an alternate satellite would require us to redirect all of the satellite dishes in our networks a very time consuming and expensive process 
the loss of a satellite could also result in increased costs of using satellites 
we are dependent on transmissions from the satellite to our customer sites  and these transmissions may be interrupted or experience other difficulty  which could result in service interruptions and delays in our networks 
in addition  the use of the satellite to provide transmissions to our customers requires a direct line of sight between the satellite and the receiver at the business site and is subject to distance and rain attenuation 
in markets that experience heavy rainfall we may need to use greater power to maintain transmission quality 
such changes may require federal communications commission  or fcc  approval  which may not be granted 
we may be subject to third party abuses of our networks  such as computer viruses  spam or hacking  which could lead to interruptions in our services and other adverse consequences which could be expensive to fix  subject us to liability or result in lower use of our networks than expected 
the future success of our business depends on the security of our planned networks 
computer viruses or problems caused by our users or other third parties  such as the sending of excessive volumes of unsolicited bulk e mail or spam  could lead to interruptions  delays  or cessation in service to our users 
in addition  the sending of spam through our networks could result in third parties asserting claims against us 
we may not prevail in such claims and our failure to do so could result in large judgments that would harm our business 
users or other third parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems by their inappropriate use of the internet  including hacking  which could cause losses to us  or our users or deter persons from using our services 
users or third parties may also potentially expose us to liability by identity theft  or posing as another network user 
unauthorized access by current and former employees or others could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems and that of our users 
we expect that our users will increasingly use the internet for commercial transactions in the future 
any network malfunction or security breach could cause these transactions to be delayed  not completed at all  or completed with compromised security 
users or others may assert claims of liability against us as a result of any failure by us to prevent these network malfunctions and security breaches  and may deter others from using our services  which could cause our business prospects to suffer 
although we intend to continue using industry standard security measures  such measures have been circumvented in the past  and we cannot assure you that these measures will not be circumvented in the future 
in addition  to alleviate problems caused by computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security breaches  we may have to interrupt  delay  or cease service to our users  which could severely harm our business 
we are dependent on leased satellite bandwidth  and if such a lease is unavailable to us  we could be subjected to significant restrictions on our business 
we leased satellite bandwidth from spacenet for our discontinued school business 
we have agreed to lease all of our satellite transponder capacity from spacenet and other third parties 
if we achieve the substantial subscriber growth that we anticipate  we will need additional satellite capacity 
if we are unable to procure this capacity  we may be unable to provide service to our subscribers or the quality of service we provide may not meet their expectations 
there is no assurance that these third parties will continue to provide the capacity and positioning we need on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we were forced to change our satellite capacity providers  we would be forced to spend significant time and resources finding alternative providers and re pointing antennas 
if  for any reason  we are not able to obtain the benefits of the lease with spacenet or another satellite provider on favorable terms  our business could be significantly jeopardized  as it is bi directional satellite based 
the satellite industry is a highly regulated industry 
in the united states  operation and use of satellites requires licenses from the fcc 
as a lessee of satellite space  we could in the future be indirectly subject to new laws  policies or regulations or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  policies or regulations  any of which may modify the present regulatory environment in the united states of america 
while we believe that spacenet will be able to obtain all us licenses and authorizations necessary to operate effectively  it may not continue to be successful in doing so 
our failure to indirectly obtain some or all necessary licenses or approvals could impose significant additional costs and restrictions on our business  require us to change our operating methods  or result in us no longer being able to provide our service to affected users 
if we are unable to compete effectively against our current and potential competitors  then we may lose users to other services  which could result in lower usage of our planned networks as well as lower than expected revenues 
the market for our industry specific private network products and services is new and rapidly evolving  and we expect competition in and around this market to intensify in the future 
while we do not believe any of our competitors currently offer the bundle of products and services we will offer  we face competition from a number of companies who i provide services and functionality similar to some of our services and functionality  ii who market products and services to a similar base of users  or both  and iii could in the future seek to compete more directly with us 
for example  hughes electronics currently offers one way satellite based broadband internet access to businesses  and it has an alliance with america online to promote america online s broadband services and content 
we therefore believe that our greatest potential competitive threat is posed not by a single company  but a combination of one or more companies that each addresses different parts of our new business model 
many of our existing competitors for some of our products and services  as well as potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
this may allow such competitors to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their products and services and to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to our potential subscribers  partners  sponsors and e commerce merchants 
many of these competitors may offer a wider range of products and services than we do  may attract sponsors and subscribers to our competitors products and services and  consequently  result in lower acceptance and usage of our private network products and services 
business enterprises may use alternative means to acquire computers  services  industry specific content  and internet access  which could reduce our potential user base and may lead to lower than expected revenues 
we believe an attraction of our business is the complete bundle of computer hardware  software  industry specific content and broadband internet connectivity we intend to offer 
however  for a variety of reasons  business enterprises may decide to use other methods to acquire computers  internet access and other services to meet their needs 
if business enterprises decide to use means other than deployment of our products and services  it will limit our user and sponsor base  and consequently we will have lower than expected revenues 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital to fund our operations when needed 
we expect to use our existing cash for general corporate purposes  developing starband latin america business  expanding our sales and marketing activities if the prospects for our vertical market business remain encouraging  continuing investments in technology and product development and other capital expenditures  as well as working capital and other corporate expenses  including the funding of net losses from operations 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  our cash requirements are large  and depend on several factors  including cash outflows due to lease obligations  the rate of expansion of our planned industry specific private networks  our success in generating revenues  the growth of sales and marketing efforts  and other factors 
if capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if additional funds were raised through the issuance of debt securities  such securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to deploy our planned networks  develop or enhance our services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
given gilat s majority ownership and future control of the board of directors  all future financing decisions will be made by gilat 
we are dependent on growth in use and popularity of our networks and the internet by our users and our ability to successfully anticipate the frequently changing tastes of our users 
our business is unlikely to be successful if the popularity of the internet as a viable business tool does not continue to increase 
even if the popularity of the internet and related media does increase  the success of our planned industry specific private network in particular depends on our ability to anticipate and keep current with the frequently changing tastes of our users  primarily small and medium sized business enterprises in the industries we seek to serve 
any failure on our part to successfully anticipate  identify or react to changes in styles  trends or preferences of our users would lead to reduced interest in and use of our networks and therefore limit opportunities for sponsorship sales  subscriber fees and e commerce revenues 
moreover  the rstar networks brand could be eroded by misjudgments in service offerings or a failure to keep our offerings  services and content current with the evolving preferences of the marketplace 
unauthorized access could harm our business and cause us to lose existing customers  deter potential customers and harm our reputation 
unauthorized access could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in the computer systems of our customers  which might cause our subscribers to bring liability claims against us and also might deter potential customers from using our services 
since our services allow end users to be connected to the internet at all times  unauthorized users may have a greater ability to access information stored in end users computer systems 
always on internet services may give unauthorized users  or hackers  more and longer opportunities to break into end users computer or access  misappropriate  destroy or otherwise alter data accessed through the internet 
we may be subject to liability for services sold through our network 
to date  we have had very limited experience in enabling consumers to directly purchase products and services online or in the development of relationships with manufacturers or suppliers of such products and services 
however  we plan to develop a range of e commerce opportunities in connection with our industry specific private networks 
network users may sue us if the products or services sold online are defective  fail to perform properly or injure the user 
liability claims resulting from our sale of products could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
we may be subject to liability for information retrieved and replicated by means of our services 
because our customers end users will download and redistribute material and we may replicate material or store it on our own network devices in connection with our services  claims may be made against us for defamation  or other theories based on the nature and content of such materials 
these types of claims have been brought  and sometimes successfully litigated  against online service providers in the past 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of these types  or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and losses over a significant period of time 
we are heavily dependent on our relationship with gilat for key network technology  hardware and software  and we may be significantly harmed if gilat is unable or fails to continue to develop and sell us this technology and related equipment 
we will depend on gilat and its subsidiaries and suppliers for the satellite technology used to deliver our products and services 
we have an agreement with gilat pursuant to which  if certain conditions are met  gilat will serve as our exclusive provider of the equipment  technology and services that we will use in our latin american operations 
if we are not able to perform our obligations under our agreements with gilat  or if gilat is unable or fails to continue to sell us this equipment and technology under the current terms of our agreement  our ability to operate our latin american operations would be severely harmed 
gilat s principal offices  development facilities and manufacturing and research are located in the state of israel 
gilat is directly affected by the political  economic and military conditions in israel 
gilat s production is dependent upon components imported from outside of israel and any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could significantly harm gilat s ability to meet its supply obligations to us 
if gilat does not meet our demand and quality standards for its products  for any reason  or if the terms of our agreements with gilat change and we decide to pursue other strategic partners  it is unlikely that we would be able to find a replacement supplier without significant harm to our business operations or relationship with gilat 
our future growth depends on a number of technological advances gilat expects to attain over its existing satellite technology and which gilat has agreed to license to us  such as the development of software that we expect will enable us to optimize the allocation of end users across our leased satellite capacity and reduce our satellite capacity costs per end user 
furthermore  gilat has substantial business operations and opportunities apart from our business  and gilat may develop different business objectives than ours 
as a result  situations may arise in which gilat s interests diverge from rstar or our other stockholders 
for example  we expect to be one of gilat s largest customers for their technology  equipment and software 
we will seek to purchase from gilat technology  products  software and equipment necessary to the operations of starband latin america at prices favorable to us  but gilat will seek to sell those items to us at prices favorable to them 
if gilat does not meet our expectations regarding these technological advances  our ability to successfully operate our business  and our financial condition and profitability  would be harmed 
our success depends upon the successful development of new services and features in the face of rapidly evolving technology 
the market for our current products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards 
the recent growth of the internet and intense competition in our industry exacerbate these market characteristics 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance  features and reliability of our networks 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new features  content or network services 
in addition  our new enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective sponsors and subscribers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
we could also incur substantial costs if we needed to modify our service or infrastructures to adapt to these changes 
failure to manage the growth of our operations could harm our business and strain our managerial  operational and financial resources 
we have recently and significantly changed our business model and strategy 
we anticipate that future expansion will be required to build a sponsor and subscriber base if we are to be successful in implementing our business strategy 
we may not be able to implement management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
if we were unable to manage growth effectively  our business would suffer 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will be required to improve existing and implement new operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures  install new management information systems  and train  motivate and manage our sales and marketing  engineering  technical and customer support employees 
we do not have any experience in doing business in latin america 
our employees  outsourcing arrangements  systems  procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations 
in particular  once the acquisition of starband latin america is completed  we expect that demands on the network infrastructure and our technical support resources will increase rapidly as our customer base grows 
we may therefore experience difficulties meeting a high demand for services in the future or encounter problems in dealing with the customs of various countries in latin america 
in order to meet this demand  we will need to hire  train and retain the appropriate personnel  as well as the third party service providers we depend on for customer service  to manage our operations 
we will also need to adapt our financial and management controls  billing and information systems  reporting systems and operating systems 
our failure to manage growth and expansion effectively  or the failure by one of our service providers to adequately perform ts services  could harm our ability to retain or grow our customer base which in turn would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of key personnel may hurt our ability to operate our business effectively 
our success depends  in part  upon the continued contributions of the principal members of our sales  engineering and management departments  many of whom perform important management functions and would be difficult to replace 
the loss of the services of any key personnel could seriously harm our business 
if we are unable to retain and hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully achieve our objectives 
we have hired engineering  sales  marketing  customer support accounting and other personnel 
we may not be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  and we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to deploy our networks in a timely fashion or to support our users and operations 
we have at times experienced  and continue to experience  difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
recruiting qualified personnel is an intensely competitive and time consuming process 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders and result in increased debt and assumption of contingent liabilities 
as part of our business strategy  we may consider acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in the event of such future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities  which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  or assume contingent liabilities 
such actions by us could have a detrimental effect on our results of operations and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions also entail numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  technologies  products or personnel  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition that could materially adversely affect our results of operations  negative effects on our reported results of operations from acquisition related charges and of amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
our dependence on third parties for our intellectual property puts us at risk if this intellectual property is not properly protected or infringes upon the rights of others 
we rely exclusively on third parties like gilat and spacenet for most of the intellectual property used in our business 
if gilat or any of our other suppliers fails to adequately protect their intellectual property or is found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of other parties  our ability to operate our business as expected may  in turn  be harmed 
infringement claims could materially harm our business and financial condition 
from time to time  we may receive notice of claims of infringement of third parties proprietary rights 
the fields of telecommunications and internet communications are filled with domestic and international patents  both pending and issued 
we may unknowingly infringe such a patent 
we may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others  especially patent rights 
someone  including a competitor  might file a suit with little merit  in order to harm us commercially  to force us to re allocate resources to defending such a claim  or extract a large settlement 
in addition  our employees might utilize proprietary and trade secret information from their former employers without our knowledge  even though we prohibit these practices 
any litigation  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in high litigation costs  divert our management s attention and resources or cause us to delay deployment of related technology 
a jury or judge may decide against us even if we had not in fact infringed 
if we lose or are forced to settle  we could be required to remove or replace allegedly infringing technology  to develop non infringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
these royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
possible infringement of intellectual property rights could harm our business 
we seek to protect our intellectual property and to respect the intellectual property rights of others 
to protect our own intellectual property  we rely on us and international law regarding copyright  patents  trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  contractors and business partners 
we cannot guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining  registering  policing or defeating challenges to our intellectual property rights  or that we will avoid claims that we are infringing the rights of others 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  we may be unsuccessful in doing so 
we may be unable to obtain patents or register trademarks for a variety of reasons  including a mistaken belief that these items are eligible for intellectual property protection or that we are the entity entitled to this protection  if any 
our copyrights and trade secrets may similarly turn out to be ineligible for legal protection 
in addition  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our proprietary information despite  or in the absence of  a confidentiality agreement 
some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the united states of america  and intellectual property law in the united states of america is still uncertain and evolving as applied to internet related industries 
the status of domain names and the regulatory bodies in charge of them is also unsettled 
any inability to register or otherwise protect our intellectual property rights could seriously harm our business since it could enable competitors to copy important features on our network 
furthermore  third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us 
these claims  possibly including those from companies from which we license key technology for our operations  could result in significant liability  the inability to use key rights and technologies  and the invalidation of our own proprietary rights 
in addition  regardless of the outcome  any litigation could be time consuming  expensive  and distracting of management s time and attention 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to our various outstanding debt instruments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to the expense related to those debt instruments and credit facilities that are tied to market rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade and high credit quality securities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would not cause the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents or the interest expense paid with respect to our outstanding debt instruments to change by a material amount 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
as of december   we had not engaged in any significant foreign currency activity
