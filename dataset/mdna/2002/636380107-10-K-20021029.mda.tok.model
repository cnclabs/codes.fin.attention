the company is subject to external factors that could significantly impact its business  including potential reductions in reimbursement rates by medicare  medicaid and third party payors for the company s services  retroactive adjustments due to prior year audits  reviews and investigations  government fraud and abuse initiatives and other such factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results 
the balanced budget act was signed into law on august  under the act  until october   medicare certified home health agencies were reimbursed under an ips for a two year period prior to the implementation of a prospective payment system 
under ips  home health care providers were reimbursed the lower of i their actual costs  ii cost limits based on of median costs of freestanding home health agencies  or iii an agency specific per patient cost limit  based on costs adjusted for inflation 
prior to the implementation of ips  medicare reimbursed providers on a reasonable cost basis subject to program imposed cost per visit limitations 
effective october   under the prospective payment system  the last remaining phase under the act  medicare now reimburses providers a predetermined base payment 
the payment is adjusted for the health condition and care needs of the beneficiary and is also adjusted for the geographic differences in wages across the country 
medicare provides home health agencies with payments for day episodes of care 
the final piece of the act called for a cut in medicare reimbursement effective october  to date  the change to the prospective payment system has not had a material impact on reimbursement  however  there can be no assurance that future reimbursement under the prospective payment system will not result in reduced reimbursement rates 
the implementation of ips resulted in a decrease in medicare revenue from the company s medicare certified agency 
in addition  the company s operations in new york and new jersey are dependent upon referrals  primarily from medicare certified home health care agencies  whose reimbursement had been adversely affected 
under the prospective payment system  there can be no assurance that the company s future referrals will not result in reduced reimbursement rates or reduced volume of business

in may  sunstar completed its initial public offering following a complete change in management and the adoption of a business plan by new management for the establishment of a health maintenance organization 
as a result  sunstar was no longer consolidated with the company for accounting purposes 
the company had utilized the equity method of accounting for its investment in sunstar 
in february  sunstar s sole operating subsidiary effectively discontinued operations 
as of july   the company s value of its investment in sunstar is critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those estimates related to its allowance for possible losses  asset impairments  income taxes  commitments and contingencies and third payor liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the accounting policies set forth in the consolidated financial statements are those policies that are most important to the presentation of its financial statements and such policies may require subjective and complex judgments on the part of management
