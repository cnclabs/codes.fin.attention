item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the reorganization of our company we implemented our plan to split fmc into separate chemical and machinery companies in through a two step process 
the first step included an initial public offering ipo of percent of our machinery businesses  named fmc technologies  inc technologies  which took place in the second quarter of technologies consists of our former energy systems and food and transportation systems business segments 
subsequent to the ipo  technologies made payments of million to our company in exchange for the net assets distributed to technologies on june   which we used to retire short term and long term debt 
the second step  the distribution of our remaining percent ownership in technologies the spin off occurred on december  total net assets distributed on december  were million 
we believe that the spin off of technologies will allow our company to focus its efforts in the chemical industry through improved customer orientation  increased innovation and overall growth 
in an effort to align our business with our future growth plans  we took various strategic measures  including the restructuring of businesses  reduction of staff  plant shutdowns and the writedown of certain underperforming assets 
we believe these steps will increase our company s financial flexibility as market conditions change 
risk and our significant accounting policies as would be expected  these changes in our company have altered our overall risk environment as described below and elsewhere in this report 
in addition to risk factors  we have also identified and reviewed our significant accounting policies  all of which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements  while noting that the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that require judgment 
these estimates and assumptions can significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses at the date of our financial statements and for the reporting periods shown 
our disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements are similarly affected by estimates and assumptions 
some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared 
for example  we provide for environmental related obligations when they are believed to be probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated 
also  we review the recoverability of the net book values of our investments in affiliates and  our fixed and intangible assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable 
when this is the case  we record an impairment loss 
we also continually assess the return on our business segments  which sometimes results in a plan to restructure the operations of a business 
when such a plan is final  we record an accrual for severance and other contractual commitments and obligations 
finally  our reserves for discontinued operations consist of obligations for discontinued operations  for environmental remediation and study obligations from some of our former chemical plant sites  and product liabilities and other potential claims  including those related to retiree medical and life insurance benefits 
see a further discussion on all of the policies in notes      and to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations general all results discussed in this analysis address the continuing operations of our chemical businesses 
technologies results have been reclassified to discontinued operations within our consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended december   and accordingly  the results of the energy systems and food and transportation systems business segments will not be included in the results of operations discussion and analysis 
our loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   was million compared to income of million and million in and  respectively 
income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  excluding special items defined below for the year ended december   was million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
special items in consisted of asset impairments and restructuring and other charges totaling million million after tax 
special items in consisted of asset impairments and restructuring and other charges totaling million million after tax 
special items in consisted of asset impairments  restructuring and other charges and gains on divestitures of businesses totaling a gain of million million after tax 
the following table displays the results for the years  and through a reconciliation between as reported income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  excluding special items 
years ended december in millions income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as reported asset impairments restructuring and other charges gains on divestitures of businesses tax effect of asset impairments  restructuring and other charges and gains on divestitures of businesses income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  excluding special items results of operations compared to in the following discussion  year refers to the year ending december  and prior year refers to the year ending december  all comparisons are between these periods unless otherwise noted 
revenue was  million in  down from  million in revenue in the united states decreased percent compared with  while revenue outside the united states  including exports  decreased percent from sales in the united states represented percent of our revenue  slightly less than in income from continuing operations  before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income taxes  excluding asset impairments and restructuring and other charges was million in compared to million in this decline can be attributed to an overall economic downturn impacting the chemical industry worldwide and other factors discussed under segment results below 
asset impairments totaled million million after tax for compared to million million after tax in based upon a comprehensive review of our long lived assets we recorded asset impairment charges of million related to our us based phosphorus business 
the components of asset impairments related to this business  include a million impairment of environmental assets built to comply with a resource conservation and recovery act rcra consent decree consent decree at the pocatello  idaho facility and a million impairment charge for our investment in astaris  llc astaris  our phosphorus joint venture with solutia  inc solutia 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
driving these charges were a decline in market conditions  the loss of a potential site on which to develop an economically viable second purified phosphoric acid ppa plant and our agreement to pay into a fund for the shoshone bannock tribes as a result of an agreement to support a proposal to amend the consent decree permitting the earlier closure of the largest remaining waste disposal pond at pocatello 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our specialty chemicals segment s lithium operations in argentina 
we established this operation  which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities  approximately five years ago in a remote area of the andes mountains 
with the entry of a south american manufacturer into this business  resulting in decreased revenues and following the continuation of other unfavorable market conditions  our lithium assets in argentina became impaired as the total capital invested is not expected to be recovered 
an additional million of charges related to the impairment of assets in our cyanide operations 
during the second quarter of  we recorded asset impairments of million million after tax 
impairments of million were recognized because of the formation of astaris see note to our consolidated financial statements  including the write down of certain phosphorus assets retained by our company and the accrual of costs related to our planned closure of two phosphorus facilities 
other asset impairments were due to the impact of underlying changes within the specialty chemicals segment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our accounting policies related to asset impairments 
restructuring and other charges 
a change in market conditions and in our corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of million million after tax in the year 
a charge of million million after tax was recorded in we believe that the restructuring and other charges recorded in have enabled us to engage in long term growth opportunities for all of our business segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our accounting policies related to restructuring and other charges 
we had several minor restructuring activities related to corporate reorganization in the first quarter of totaling approximately million 
during the second quarter of  we recorded million in restructuring and other charges including million related to our industrial chemicals segment s us based phosphorus business 
the components included in restructuring and other charges related to the phosphorus business were as follows a million reserve for further required consent decree spending at the pocatello site  million of financing obligations to the astaris joint venture and other related costs  and a million reserve for payments to the shoshone bannock tribes and million of other related charges 
in addition  restructuring charges for the quarter included million related to our corporate reorganization 
the remaining charges of million were for the restructuring of two smaller chemical facilities 
we reduced our workforce by approximately people in connection with these restructuring activities 
during the third quarter of the year  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
these charges were largely for reorganization costs and corporate restructuring activities including severance and contract commitment costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we recorded restructuring and other charges of million in the fourth quarter of most of these charges related to our decision to shutdown operations at pocatello 
these charges include million for our share of astaris shutdown costs including environmental cleanup  waste removal and other activities  also included are million of pocatello costs related to plant demolition  plant shutdown  severance and other activities 
in addition  million of severance and other costs related to the agricultural products segment were recorded primarily as a result of our decision to refocus certain research and development activities 
the remaining charges reflected restructuring initiatives in our specialty chemicals segment and in corporate 
we reduced our workforce by approximately people in connection with the third and fourth quarter restructuring activities 
during  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million million after tax 
restructuring charges of million were attributable to the formation of astaris and the concurrent reorganization of our industrial chemicals sales  marketing and support organizations  the reduction of office space requirements in our philadelphia chemical headquarters and pension expense related to the separation of phosphorus personnel from our company 
in addition  we recorded environmental accruals of million because of increased cost estimates for ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties 
other restructuring charges included million for other projects 
of the approximately employee severances that were expected to occur through the completion of these programs in  occurred at december  while the remainder occurred in income loss from continuing operations was a loss of million in compared to income of million in most of the decline can be attributed to after tax asset impairments and restructuring and other charges of million in compared to after tax charges of million in also contributing to the decline were poor economic conditions affecting the chemical industry worldwide 
corporate expenses excluding restructuring and other charges in and were million in and million in other income and expense  net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension income or expense 
net other expense for the year was million compared to net other income of million in this variance is largely attributable to increased pension costs and lower amortization of a deferred pension asset 
net interest expense in was million compared to million in the decrease in net interest expense in was primarily the result of lower average debt levels during the year 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in resulting in an effective tax rate of percent compared to income tax expense of million and an effective tax rate of percent in the differences between the effective tax rates for these periods and the statutory us federal income tax rate relate primarily to differing foreign tax rates  the impairment of certain argentina assets  foreign sales corporation benefits  incremental state taxes and non deductible goodwill amortization 
discontinued operations 
we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million million after tax in included in this amount are earnings of technologies  including interest expense of million  which was allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with accounting principles board statement no 
apb and later relevant accounting guidance  costs related to the spin off and additional income tax provision related to the reorganization of our worldwide entities in anticipation of the separation of technologies from fmc 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses 
during  we recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of million million after tax 
of this amount  million are earnings of the spun off technologies business  including allocated interest expense of million 
also included are a million loss for a settlement of litigation related to our discontinued defense systems business and a charge of million for interest charges on postretirement benefit obligations 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million for compared to net income of million in this variance reflects the effect of significant asset impairments and restructuring and other charges recorded in additional information regarding discontinued operations and the related accounting policies can be found in notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
segment results compared to see note to our consolidated financial statements for detailed segment results 
segment operating profit is presented before taxes  asset impairments and restructuring and other charges 
information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level is discussed below and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
agricultural products agricultural products revenue decreased to million in from million in agricultural products segment operating profit declined to million  down percent from the prior year 
the decrease in agricultural products revenues was largely due to a lack of sulfentrazone sales to ei du pont de nemours and company dupont in in we entered into an exclusive agreement with dupont to provide them sulfentrazone in north america for use on soybeans 
however  the sale of formulated products incorporating sulfentrazone did not reach expectations and the contract purchases were cancelled in dupont no longer has exclusive rights to the use of sulfentrazone on soybeans in north america 
we began developing new markets in  expanding our sulfentrazone sales  including sales into the soybean market in north america 
we believe that we have recovered approximately one third of the sulfentrazone volumes lost from the absence of dupont s purchases 
somewhat offsetting the sulfentrazone sales decline in north america was an increase in carfentrazone sales into the rice and cotton defoliation markets as a result of new product registrations 
we believe that sulfentrazone sales will increase slightly in  however  we will idle our production facility early in to allow product inventories to align with expected sales volumes 
agricultural products sales were also affected by weakened asian markets due to depressed crop prices  unfavorable climatic conditions and lower pricing in some asian markets due to weaker exchange rates 
asian revenue shortfalls were offset by stronger demand for herbicides in latin and south america due mainly to the introduction of several new herbicide registrations in agricultural products operating profit declined to million from million as a result of a decline in operating margins to percent in from percent in this lower profitability reflects reduced volumes of sulfentrazone  weaker pricing due to lower crop prices  and weaker currencies in asia and brazil 
the adverse impact of the lower sulfentrazone volumes in north america was significantly offset by a one time contract penalty payment from dupont of million which was paid in the first half of additionally  agricultural products incurred higher selling costs in north america in as it pursued new sulfentrazone markets through direct selling instead of through dupont s sales channels 
during the fourth quarter of  agricultural products began a restructuring of its operations to focus on key markets and products 
we will concentrate our future research and development r d activities on our core strength of insecticides and reduce all work on herbicides  while continuing our efforts to maximize the market potential of already commercialized herbicide chemistries including clomazone  carfentrazone and sulfentrazone 
additionally  we have reduced our direct sales and support staffs outside north  south and latin america  relying instead on new and expanded strategic alliances with ishihara sangyo kaisha  ltd isk in asia and belchim in europe 
a restructuring charge of million million after tax was taken in the fourth quarter to implement these plans 
this restructuring should be complete by the end of the first quarter we believe that agricultural products will have a challenging year in  but the actions we have taken to expand product labels  improve market access and reduce costs should allow us to recover the earnings decline that resulted from the loss of dupont s sulfentrazone business 
specialty chemicals specialty chemicals revenue was million in  down from million in due to lower revenue in both the fmc biopolymer as biopolymer and lithium businesses 
specialty chemicals segment operating profit declined to million  or percent from million in the prior year 
biopolymer revenue decreases resulted from a combination of weaker demand and lower selling prices for alginate and carrageenan in specialty markets  partially offset by strong growth from microcrystalline cellulose in the pharmaceutical and food ingredients markets 
specialty markets  which include pet food  textiles and household products  experienced the impacts of a slowing economy and lower competitor pricing 
customer inventory corrections and a weak euro also drove sales lower 
lithium revenue decreases resulted from our strategic exit from the commodity lithium carbonate market and slower industrial markets  particularly in europe 
the lithium carbonate market has experienced substantially lower prices since the entry of a new competitor in which resulted in our decision to exit the market 
these sales declines were offset by continued growth in lithium specialty products 
specialty chemicals operating profit decreased to million in from million in despite relatively flat operating margins as compared to the decrease in operating profit can be attributed to a decrease in biopolymer volumes and prices in the pet food  textile and household products markets offset  in part  by lower operating costs and an improved mix in lithium 
a weaker euro  compared to the prior year  also unfavorably impacted earnings 
industrial chemicals industrial chemicals revenue decreased to million in  compared to million in industrial chemical segment operating profit declined by percent to million in from million in revenue decreases reflected weaker demand in most markets for industrial chemicals 
weaker end market demand for glass and the entry of a new competitor resulted in lower soda ash volumes and revenue compared to the prior year 
price increases announced in the late summer of are not expected to have any material effect on revenues until in hydrogen peroxide  weakness in the pulp and textile markets resulted in decreased revenues despite the price increases initiated in late and the application of an energy surcharge in early softer demand in the polymer and electronics end markets also resulted in lower volumes for specialty peroxygens 
foret  our spain based operation  recorded increases in sales that reflected strong phosphate and zeolite markets 
phosphate volumes improved as a result of a recovery in their export markets  particularly in the middle east and north africa 
zeolite sales increased as a result of an acquisition in the third quarter of and stronger sales to new and existing customers 
conversely  peroxygen sales declined on lower export sales 
foret s increase in sales was offset by unfavorable translation  due to a weaker euro in these revenue comparisons were further affected by the inclusion of the sales of our us based phosphorus business in the first three months of subsequent us phosphorus sales have been deconsolidated and recorded in earnings from equity investments as part of astaris  which was formed effective april  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we account for astaris on an equity basis for industrial chemicals and therefore  the sales of astaris are not reflected in our consolidated revenues after march industrial chemicals operating profit net of minority interests decreased percent to million in from million in driving the industrial chemicals segment s profit decreases were lower sales volumes in hydrogen peroxide  soda ash and active oxidants and reduced earnings from astaris  as discussed below 
additionally  during we hedged our natural gas requirements for  which  due to the forward pricing in the market at that time  resulted in generally higher gas costs in versus the prior year 
offsetting these unfavorable factors were increased pricing in several products 
our us based phosphorus business is comprised of our percent interest in astaris for the manufacture and sale of our phosphorus based products  and the activities of our corporate phosphorus division  which manages remediation and other environmental projects associated with the astaris elemental phosphorus plant in pocatello  idaho 
astaris has experienced a difficult business environment as a result of the economic slowdown and significant changes in its manufacturing and sourcing strategy 
during the first quarter of  astaris was asked by its electric power provider  idaho power company  to assist in combating the energy crisis in the state of idaho 
historically  the astaris elemental phosphorus facility has been the largest consumer of power in the state 
astaris agreed to work with idaho power and signed a two year agreement to resell megawatts of power to idaho power at rates below the then current market prices  but above the rate paid by astaris under its power contract 
the gross economic value of the power contract  in the nine months of during which the contract was in effect  was million of which half  or million  is reflected in fmc s earnings in astaris 
however  this decision required astaris to shutdown one of the two remaining operating furnaces in pocatello and to source raw materials including purified phosphoric acid and other products from third party suppliers at an additional cost to astaris of approximately million million is reflected in fmc s earnings in astaris 
this significant restructuring of the supply chain also adversely impacted astaris sales 
sales declined due to the intentional reduction of volume capacity and astaris inability to meet customer material needs 
in december  the idaho public utility commission ipuc was petitioned by its staff to reduce the future amounts to be paid to astaris under the power resale contract 
this petition is subject to the approval of the full ipuc  which is expected to make a decision later in any adverse decision would be subject to appeal 
additionally  the start up of the new astaris ppa plant in soda springs  idaho in the second half of the year added costs in start up costs for this plant are expected to continue until early our corporate phosphorus division also affected segment operating profit in working with the epa and the shoshone bannock tribes we agreed to amend the july consent decree to permit the capping of a specific waste disposal pond at the pocatello site 
as part of this settlement  fmc agreed to contribute million to a fund for the tribes to support various tribal activities 
million was paid during 
this agreement enabled astaris to shutdown the pocatello operation in december we expect the results of our us based phosphorus operations to improve in the new astaris ppa plant in idaho should be fully operational in early and start up expenses experienced in should be significantly less in in addition  spending by the corporate phosphorus division will be lower in compared with due to lower spending on projects under the consent decree 
we believe the shutdown of the elemental phosphorus production at pocatello will enable astaris to lower its costs by increasing the share of the supplies it obtains from lower cost purified phosphoric acid 
following this challenging year  we believe that results in the industrial chemicals segment will improve in we will continue to focus on lowering the cost of production and we expect to benefit from the restructuring of our us phosphorus business 
however  market demand is expected to continue to be weak through most of partially offsetting the improvements in our us phosphorus business 
results of operations compared to revenue was  million in  down from  million in revenue in the united states decreased percent compared with  while revenue outside the united states  including exports  decreased by less than percent when compared to sales in the united states represented percent of our revenue compared to percent in revenue 
lower revenue in when compared with was principally attributable to the contribution of our phosphorus operations to a joint venture and to divestitures of other businesses  and was offset by revenue from a specialty chemicals business acquired in beginning april   sales of phosphorus chemicals were recorded by astaris and are not reflected as revenue in our consolidated financial statements 
our interest in astaris is accounted for under the equity method and our share of astaris operating earnings is included in operating profit for our industrial chemicals segment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income from continuing operations  before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income taxes excluding asset impairments and restructuring and other charges in and and gains on divestitures of businesses in was million in compared with million in this increase reflects the performance of our business segments discussed more fully below and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
gains on divestitures of businesses 
on july   we completed the sale of our bioproducts business to cambrex corporation for million in cash  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
our bioproducts business was included in our specialty chemicals segment and had revenue of million through the date of divestiture 
on july   we completed the sale of our process additives business to great lakes chemical corporation for million in cash  resulting in a gain of million on both a pre tax and after tax basis 
our process additives business was included in our specialty chemicals segment and had revenue of million through the date of divestiture 
asset impairments recorded by the company amounted to million million after tax and million million after tax for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the second quarter of  we recorded asset impairments of million 
impairments of million were recognized as a result of the formation of astaris see note to our consolidated financial statements  including the writedown of certain phosphorus assets retained by our company and the accrual of costs related to the planned closure of two phosphorus facilities 
other impairments were due to the impact of underlying changes within the specialty chemicals segment 
in the third quarter of  we recorded asset impairments of million 
asset impairments of million were required to write off the remaining net book values of two us lithium facilities 
both facilities were constructed to run pilot and development quantities for new lithium based products 
during the third quarter of  management determined that it would not be feasible to use the facilities as configured 
additionally  an impairment charge of million was required to write off the remaining net book value of a caustic soda facility in green river  wyoming 
estimated future cash flows related to this facility indicated that an impairment of the full value had occurred 
restructuring and other charges 
total restructuring and other charges of million million after tax were recorded in compared to million million after tax in restructuring charges of million were attributable to the astaris formation and the concurrent reorganization of our industrial chemicals sales  marketing and support organizations  the reduction of office space requirements in our philadelphia chemical headquarters and pension expense related to the separation of phosphorus personnel from our company 
in addition  we recorded environmental accruals of million because of increased cost estimates for ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties 
other restructuring charges included million for several smaller projects 
in the third quarter of  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million million after tax 
restructuring and other charges of million resulted primarily from strategic decisions to divest or restructure a number of businesses and support departments  including certain agricultural products and corporate and shared service support departments 
the remaining charge related to actions  including headcount reductions  required to achieve planned synergies from acquisitions of businesses in specialty chemicals 
income loss from continuing operations of million in was lower when compared with million in  primarily resulting from gains on divestitures of businesses in and higher restructuring and other charges recorded in corporate expenses excluding restructuring and other charges in and of million in reflected a decrease of million from the company s cost reduction efforts are responsible for this trend 
net interest expense was million and million during and  respectively 
the decrease in was the result of lower average debt levels when compared with other income and expense  net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension and postretirement plan adjustments 
other income of million remained relatively flat when compared to million recorded in discontinued operations 
during  we recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of million million after tax 
of this amount  million represents the earnings of the spun off technologies business including interest expense of million allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with apb and later relevant accounting guidance 
also included is a million loss for a settlement of litigation related to our discontinued defense systems business and a charge of million for interest charges on postretirement benefit obligations 
we recorded net income from discontinued operations of million million after tax in of this amount  million related to the earnings of the spun off technologies businesses including allocated interest expense of million 
results of discontinued operations in included gains of million from the sale of properties in california that were formerly used by our divested defense business as discussed below 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we provided million in response to updated estimates of environmental remediation costs  primarily at our former defense systems sites  and increased estimates of our liabilities for general liability  workers compensation  postretirement benefit obligations  legal defense  property maintenance and other costs 
during the year ended december   we sold several real estate properties formerly used by united defense  lp  and our defense systems operations divested by our company in in the second quarter of  we received million in cash  recognizing a gain of million  and in the fourth quarter of  we received million in cash  recognizing a gain of million related to property sales 
net income in was million compared to million in contributing to this decrease was a one time gain of million related to the divestiture of a specialty chemicals business in offset by a charge of million to discontinued operations in related to our former defense systems business segment 
segment results compared to agricultural products agricultural products revenue increased to million in compared to million in operating profits increased to million in compared to million in agricultural products revenue increased because of stronger sales in latin and north america  which more than offset lower sales in asia 
north american revenue improved after a return to more normal pest pressures following s unusually low levels 
latin american sales improved due to a rapid recovery from the devaluation of the brazilian real in  a new distribution agreement for third party products in brazil and a stronger mexican market 
increased revenue in also reflected higher volumes for herbicides and pyrethroids  offset by lower sales of carbamates 
operating profits in our agricultural products segment increased to million in from million in on increased volumes and lower costs  partially offset by higher research and development spending to develop a new herbicide and to fund our strategic alliance with devgen  a belgian biotechnology company  to support the company s insecticide discovery program 
specialty chemicals specialty chemicals revenue was million in  down from million in operating profit was million compared to million 
lower revenue in reflected our divestitures of the process additives and bioproducts businesses  both of which occurred in the third quarter of  and the effect of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
partially offsetting this decrease in was revenue from pronova biopolymer as  an alginate business acquired in mid the pronova biopolymer operation was combined with certain carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose businesses and renamed fmc biopolymer as 
biopolymer s revenue reflected a strong market for pharmaceutical and food grade microcrystalline cellulose along with growth in sales to latin america and asia  but was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation of the euro to the us dollar 
sales of lithium products were up slightly in increased revenue reflected higher volumes of butyllithium to the polymer and pharmaceutical markets 
lithium volume increases were offset by lower pricing  primarily the result of weak european currencies 
specialty chemicals operating profit in increased to million from million in biopolymer s increased profitability was based on lower manufacturing costs in for carrageenan and realized synergies associated with the acquisition of the alginate product line when compared with lithium s improved operating profitability in when compared with was a result of higher sales  and the successful implementation of manufacturing cost reduction initiatives 
industrial chemicals industrial chemicals revenue decreased to million in from  million in operating profit net of minority interests declined to million in from million in lower revenue was primarily the result of the contribution of the phosphorus business to the newly formed astaris joint venture  effective april  after that date  phosphorus revenue was no longer consolidated with our revenue 
phosphorus revenue of million through december  is included in segment revenue  while revenue in before the joint venture formation amounted to million 
subsequent to the first quarter of  our equity share of astaris earnings was included in segment operating profit for industrial chemicals 
other factors contributing to reduced revenue were the translation impact of the weaker euro and competitive pressures both at spain based fmc foret and at astaris 
partially offsetting the decline in revenue were increased sales of hydrogen peroxide  reflecting both volume and price increases compared with  and soda ash  a result of the tg soda ash acquisition in mid reduced profitability for industrial chemicals to million in was primarily the result of increased energy costs for all businesses  but especially at astaris  while foreign currency translation losses negatively affected reported operating profitability at foret 
in addition  segment profits were down due to phosphorus environmental compliance costs retained by our company for design  implementation and depreciation of capital assets in pocatello  idaho in connection with the consent decree 
offsetting these declines in profitability were higher earnings for soda ash and hydrogen peroxide 
soda ash profitability increased in  reflecting the tg soda ash acquisition and reduced costs despite significant increases in energy prices 
hydrogen peroxide s favorable operating profits were largely the result of a strong pulp and paper market 
in addition  our share of astaris results reflected the cost reduction benefits of the joint venture s rationalization and restructuring programs 
taxes although our domestic earnings losses are generally subject to tax expense benefit at the statutory rate of percent  many factors alter our consolidated tax rate 
these factors include non deductible or non taxable transactions related to goodwill or other items  differing foreign tax rates  state tax increments  depletion  extraterritorial income exclusion  and other permanent differences 
our effective tax rate of percent on income from continuing operations in also includes the beneficial impact of deductible restructuring and impairment charges recorded during the year

new accounting standards adopted on january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 
these statements establish accounting and reporting standards that require every derivative instrument to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
 as amended  requires the transition adjustment resulting from adopting these statements to be reported in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
on january   we recorded the fair value of all outstanding derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the transition adjustment was a million after tax loss to earnings and a million after tax gain to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
both components of the adjustment were recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method and adds disclosure requirements related to business combination transactions 
sfas no 
also establishes criteria for the recognition of intangible assets apart from goodwill 
this statement applies to all business combinations for which the acquisition date was july  or later 
we had no significant acquisitions during we intend to implement the provisions of sfas no 
in any of our future business combinations 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes guidelines for the financial accounting and reporting of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization  rather  it will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we are required to adopt the provisions of this pronouncement no later than the beginning of  however  goodwill and other intangible assets acquired after june   are subject immediately to the amortization provisions of this statement 
we had no material acquisitions of goodwill or other intangibles in the second half of we will adopt the amortization provisions of sfas no 
beginning in the first quarter of during  and  goodwill and other intangible amortization pretax and after discontinued operations was million  million and million  respectively 
we believe adopting sfas no 
will result in approximately a million pre tax benefit to earnings in in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we are required to adopt the provisions of this pronouncement no later than the beginning of and are evaluating the potential impact of adopting sfas no 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the statement also supersedes apb no 
provisions related to the accounting and reporting for the disposal of a segment of a business 
this statement establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the statement retains most of the requirements in sfas no 
related to the recognition of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
the statement is effective for years beginning after december  we are evaluating the potential impact of adopting sfas no 
environmental obligations our company  like other industrial manufacturers  is involved with a variety of environmental matters in the ordinary course of conducting its business and is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws 
we believe strongly that we have a responsibility to protect the environment  public health and employee safety 
this responsibility includes cooperating with other parties to resolve issues created by past and present handling of wastes 
when issues arise  including notices from the environmental protection agency or other government agencies identifying our company as a potentially responsible party prp  our environmental remediation management assesses and manages the issues 
when necessary  we use multifunctional teams composed of environmental  legal  financial and communications personnel to ensure that our actions are consistent with our responsibilities to the environment and public health  as well as to our employees and shareholders 
environmental provisions totaling million million after tax were recorded this year 
these provisions largely related to the remediation of the pocatello site as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
also included were costs related to continued cleanup of certain discontinued manufacturing operations from previous years 
this provision and those made in and  and our accounting policies on environmental remediation  are more fully described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
in the second quarter of  we provided environmental reserves totaling million related to ongoing remediation of several phosphorus manufacturing properties as part of the restructuring and other charges described previously 
additional information regarding our environmental accounting policies and environmental liabilities is included in notes and  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements 
information regarding environmental obligations associated with our discontinued operations is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
estimates of environmental spending are included in the section below entitled cash flow analysis 
liquidity and capital resources in  we experienced the net cash impact of significant special items recorded in the year and spending related to the spin off of technologies 
this spending was somewhat offset by the cash proceeds received in the ipo of technologies 
cash from operations  supplemented with proceeds from the ipo and a new credit facility  provided funding for our capital spending program  debt pay down and interest payments throughout capital expenditures totaling million in  which included million of required pocatello consent decree spending  were down percent from we believe capital expenditures will be reduced in  largely because of the absence of this consent decree spending 
principal categories of capital spending in include replacement of existing plant equipment and compliance spending related to environmental and safety standards 
we retired million of long term debt in  in part with a portion of the proceeds from the ipo of technologies 
cash paid for interest in was million compared with million in this decrease can be attributed to lower average debt levels in compared to future cash needs include the scheduled repayment of several significant financings over the next two years  operating cash requirements and capital expenditures 
we plan to meet these liquidity needs through cash generated from operations  commercial paper borrowings  accounts receivable securiti zation  borrowings under bank credit facilities  and if necessary  the issuance of additional long term debt 
we maintain a universal shelf registration under which  at december   million of securities could be issued 
we currently maintain a commercial paper financing program with outstanding borrowings at december  of million compared to million at december  our total committed contracts that will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows expected cash payments by year contractual commitments beyond total in millions short term debt long term debt lease obligations forward energy and foreign exchange contracts guarantees of vendor financing total  our five year  non amortizing committed revolving credit agreement expired in december there were no outstanding balances under this agreement at the due date 
at the same time we entered into a new million committed revolving credit facility to meet certain operating cash needs  capital expenditures  and commercial paper demands 
this credit facility will expire in december the total amount outstanding under this facility at december  was million  which was used to pay down outstanding commercial paper 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants related to leverage measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings  interest coverage measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings and consolidated net worth 
we were in compliance with the covenants as of december  we expect to renew or replace this credit facility prior to its expiration 
in january  we arranged a supplemental million committed credit facility to meet short term seasonal financing needs 
this credit facility expires on august  we also obtain financing through an accounts receivable securitization 
we sell receivables  without recourse  through our wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary  fmc funding corporation  which then sells the receivables to an unrelated finance company 
the sold receivables and repurchase obligations related to the financing are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets  because we have limited risk to repurchase the receivables 
the financing from the securitization totaled million at december  compared to million on december  the agreement for the sale of accounts receivable provides for the continuation of the program on a revolving basis through november we expect to renew or replace this financing prior to its expiration 
at december   long term debt included million of percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures due see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these debentures are callable by fmc at par plus accrued interest upon at least days prior notice 
these debentures are exchangeable by the holders at any time into the common stock of meridian gold  inc nyse mdg  the successor to a former subsidiary of fmc  at an exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment 
fmc may elect to pay the holders in cash an amount equivalent to the value of the meridian gold common stock into which the holders could exchange their debentures 
at december   fmc did not hold any shares of meridian gold common stock 
on february   the closing price of meridian gold common stock on the new york stock exchange was 
if the price goes above  it is reasonably likely that during the holders would exercise their exchange rights 
long term debt also includes million of variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds that are supported by bank letters of credit 
the letters of credit generally have a term of thirteen months and extend each month for an additional month unless and until the bank sends us a letter of non renewal 
at december   no notice of non renewal had been received 
the current rating of our commercial paper and similar short term indebtedness is a by standard poor s ratings group s p and p by moody s investors service  inc moody s 
the market for commercial paper with this rating is limited 
the current rating of our senior unsecured long term indebtedness is bbb by s p and baa by moody s 
a downgrade in our credit ratings  which may be changed  superseded or withdrawn at any time  could increase the cost and restrict the availability of future financings 
the following table displays credit facilities  debt obligations and other items along with the cash payments that could be required to repay them  if required following a downgrade or series of downgrades in our credit rating potential cash facility payments in millions commercial paper accounts receivable securitization forward energy contracts program terminates upon a reduction in rating to ba by moody s or bb by s p or below our future liquidity could be affected by certain letters of credit  commitments and guarantees we provide to vendors  customers and others for which we are contingently liable 
in connection with the spin off of technologies  we retained liability for various contingent obligations totaling million at december  contingent obligations include guarantees of the performance of technologies under various customer contracts  reimbursements on behalf of technologies under letters of credit and surety bonds  and guarantees of indebtedness of technologies 
we have a guarantee from technologies providing for reimbursement to us if we are ever called upon to satisfy these obligations 
technologies has obtained contractual releases of fmc reducing the level of liabilities for which we are contingently liable to million at february  because our expectation that the underlying obligations will be met and the existence of the guarantee from technologies  we believe it is unlikely that we would have to pay any of these contingent obligations and expect this contingent liability to continue to be reduced throughout the majority of these obligations will expire before the end of we have provided an agreement to lenders of astaris under which we have agreed to make equity contributions to astaris sufficient to make up one half of any short fall in astaris earnings below certain levels 
astaris earnings did not meet the agreed levels for and we do not expect that such earnings will meet the levels agreed for we contributed million to astaris under this arrangement in and expect to contribute a similar amount in the proportional amount of astaris indebtedness subject to this agreement from fmc at december  was million 
our estimates of future contributions are based on astaris forecasts and are subject to some uncertainty 
we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers for their seasonal borrowing 
the customers obligations to us are largely secured by liens on their crops 
the total of these guarantees at december  was million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on june   fmc acquired the assets of tg soda ash  inc tgsa from elf atochem north america  inc for approximately million in cash and a contingent payment due at year end the contingent payment amount  which will be based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between and  cannot currently be determined but could be as much as million 
our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance 
our performance is affected by general economic conditions and by financial  competitive  political  business and other factors 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
we believe that the cash generated from our businesses coupled with our ability to obtain financing will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due 
we also actively evaluate opportunities to refinance our existing obligations when financing is available on attractive terms 
if  however  we do not generate sufficient cash or complete such financings on a timely basis  we may be required to seek additional financing or sell equity on terms which may not be as favorable as we could have otherwise obtained 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing  additional borrowing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and equity capital markets  as well as our own financial condition 
cash flow analysis cash and cash equivalents at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
we had total borrowings of million and  million as of december  and  respectively 
operating working capital  which includes trade receivables net  inventories  other current assets  accounts payable  accrued payroll  other current liabilities and the current portion of accrued pension and other postretirement benefits  increased million to million at december   from an unfavorable million at december  factors contributing to the increase in operating working capital at year end when compared with include increased accounts receivable and inventory amounts 
cash required by operating activities of million for the year ended december  decreased from million of cash provided by operations in primarily as a result of increased restructuring spending accompanied by higher inventory and accounts receivable balances 
also contributing to the variance was a decrease in our accounts receivable financing balance in compared to the prior year 
cash required by investing activities of million in increased from the requirement of million  reflecting the impact of a prior year distribution from astaris  which was not repeated in the current year 
capital spending excluding acquisitions of million for the year ended december  decreased when compared with lower spending on significant capital projects was due to lower consent decree spending at pocatello 
cash provided by financing activities in of million was higher than the requirement of million  primarily due to the contribution related to the distribution of technologies assets and an increase in long term debt offset by long term debt paydowns of million 
projected spending also includes approximately million for environmental compliance at current operating sites  which is an operating expense of the company  plus approximately million of remediation spending and million for environmental study costs at current operating  previously operated and other sites  which have been accrued in prior periods 
dividends on november   our board of directors approved the spin off of the remaining percent of technologies making it an independent publicly traded company 
the spin off qualified as a tax free distribution to us stockholders 
stockholders of record as of december  received approximately shares of common stock of the new company for every share of our stock 
fractional shares were paid in cash to stockholders in lieu of fractional shares on december  no cash dividends were paid in other than amounts paid in lieu of fractional shares as discussed above 
no cash dividends were paid in no cash dividends are expected to be paid in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary financial market risks include changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity pricing 
in managing our exposure to these risks  we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we account for these derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
see new accounting standards adopted and note to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   our derivative holdings consisted primarily of foreign currency forward contracts and natural gas forward contracts 
when we or one of our subsidiaries sells or purchases products or services outside the united states  transactions are frequently denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated  when possible  with natural hedges  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  which is our reporting currency 
we recognize foreign currency gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred 
as a result  currency fluctuations among the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction gains and losses  which could be material 
due to the weakness of the euro in the period from through  our business results have been adversely affected by unfavorable us dollar translation of earnings of our operations in europe 
we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into forwards and swaps  where available  but we cannot ensure that our strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations 
additionally  we initiate hedging activities by entering into foreign exchange forward or option contracts with third parties when natural hedges do not exist 
the maturity dates of the currency exchange agreements that provide hedge coverage are consistent with those of the underlying purchase or sales commitments 
to monitor our currency exchange rate risks  we use a sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact on earnings of an immediate percent devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure 
based on a sensitivity analysis at december   fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect our consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
we believe that our hedging activities have been effective in reducing our risks related to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates because of our financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt to maintain liquidity and fund our business operations 
in managing interest rate risk  our strategic policy is to monitor the ratio of our fixed to floating rate debt 
we may  from time to time  use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we did not enter into any material interest rate swaps in or to address our exposure to risks from changes in commodity prices  we enter into forward or swap contracts relating to energy purchases used in our manufacturing processes 
the forward energy contracts qualifying as hedges are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the gains or losses on these contracts are included as an adjustment to the cost of sales or services when the contracts are settled
