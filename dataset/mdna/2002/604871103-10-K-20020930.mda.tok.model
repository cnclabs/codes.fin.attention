accounting for income taxes 
the valuation allowance was determined by estimating the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the deferred tax asset  management considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset would not be realized 
based upon the capital nature of the deferred tax asset and the company s projections for future capital gains in which the deferred tax asset would be deductible  management did not deem it more likely than not that the asset would be recoverable at june the company had previously recorded a reduction of the valuation allowance applied against deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes which provided a one time income tax benefit of  during the first quarter of fiscal year the valuation allowance was established in fiscal year because the future tax benefit of certain below market stock option grants issued at that time could not be reasonably assured 
the company continually reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognized the income tax benefit during the quarter due to the reasonable expectation that such tax benefit will be realized due to the fiscal strength of the company 
management believes that it will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the tax benefit associated with these future deductible temporary differences and  therefore  the company reduced the valuation allowance during the first quarter of fiscal year critical accounting policies general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  goodwill  property  plant and equipment and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  property  plant and equipment  goodwill and income taxes to be critical policies due to the estimation process involved in each

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market and consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairments of inventory on a quarterly basis 
the company s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process and finished goods

and sfas and sfas  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
sfas replaces accounting principles board apb opinion business combinations and requires the use of the purchase method for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate goodwill might be impaired 
with the adoption of sfas  as of july   the company reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets to make any necessary amortization period adjustments 
based on that assessment  only goodwill was determined to have an indefinite useful life and no adjustments were made to the amortization period or residual values of other intangible assets 
sfas provides a six month transitional period from the effective date of adoption for the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired 
to the extent that an indication of impairment exists  the company must perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment 
the second test must be performed as soon as possible  but no later that the end of the fiscal year 
any impairment measured as of the date of adoption will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on short term investments and foreign exchange rates  which generate translation gains and losses due to the english pound to us dollar conversion of labcaire 
interest rates the company s short term investments are made up entirely of held to maturity investments  which include mostly corporate bonds with a rating of a or higher 
assuming investment levels remained the same  a one point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s interest income 
the company does not enter into interest rate swap agreements 
foreign exchange rates approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal were received in english pounds currency 
to the extent that the company s revenues are generated in english pounds  its operating results are translated for reporting purposes into us dollars using rates of and for the fiscal year ended june  and  respectively 
a strengthening of the english pound  in relation to the us dollar  will have the effect of increasing its reported revenues and profits  while a weakening of the english pound will have the opposite effect 
since the company s operations in england generally sets prices and bids for contracts in english pounds  a strengthening of the english pound  while increasing the value of its uk assets  might place the company at a pricing disadvantage in bidding for work from manufacturers based overseas 
the company collects its receivables in the currency the subsidiary resides in 
the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions  which include forward exchange agreements
