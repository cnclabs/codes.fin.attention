item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company is a full service investor in and servicer of multifamily housing debt 
the company is principally engaged in the acquisition and ownership directly or indirectly of tax exempt and  on occasion  taxable multifamily housing revenue bonds issued by various state or local governments  agencies  or authorities revenue bonds and other investments that produce tax exempt income 
the revenue bonds are secured by mortgage loans on underlying properties underlying properties 
chartermac is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and  thus  is not subject to federal income taxation 
as such  chartermac will pass through to its shareholders  in the form of distributions  income  including tax exempt income  derived from its investments and activities 
although the exact percentage may vary from quarter to quarter  substantially all of the distributions to shareholders are excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes 
for the calendar year ended december   approximately of the distributions qualified as tax exempt income 
the company focuses on investing in a portfolio of revenue bonds that are secured by affordable multifamily rental housing properties 
through pwf  the company focuses on originating and servicing multifamily mortgage loans on behalf of gses such as fannie mae  freddie mac and fha 
together  these components offer a full range of capital solutions to developers of affordable and market rate multifamily housing 
the company does not operate as a mortgage reit  which generally utilizes high levels of leverage and acquire subordinated interests in commercial and or residential mortgage backed securities 
unlike mortgage reits that typically incur leverage at ratios ranging from to  the company is only able to incur leverage or other financing up to of the company s total market value as defined and pursuant to its trust agreement as of the date incurred 
furthermore  the revenue bonds owned by the company generally call for ten year restrictions from prepayments  eliminating the company s susceptibility to significant levels of repayment risk as a result of interest rate reductions 
due to the company s low level of leverage  the company is less likely than highly leveraged reits to be affected by any lack of liquidity 
the company s portfolio does not contain assets that are especially vulnerable to volatility during periods of interest rate fluctuations 
consistent with the foregoing  the company focuses on providing investors with a stable level of distributions  even through unstable markets 
in order to generate tax exempt income to pass through to the company s shareholders and  as a result  enhance the value of the company s common shares  the company primarily invests in or acquires tax exempt bonds secured by multifamily properties 
the company believes that it can earn above market rates of interest on its bond acquisitions by focusing its efforts primarily on affordable housing 
the manager estimates that nearly of all new multifamily development contains an affordable component which produces tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
the traditional methods of financing affordable housing with tax exempt revenue bonds are complex and time consuming  and involve the participation of many intermediaries 
through manager  the process has been streamlined with the direct purchase program 
the company s direct purchase program removes all intermediaries from the financing process except the governmental issuer of the revenue bond and enables developers to deal directly with one source 
because the company purchases its revenue bonds directly from the governmental issuer  the need for underwriters and their counsel  rating agencies and costly documentation is eliminated 
this reduces the financing life cycle  often by several months  and also reduces the bond issuance costs  usually by or more 
in dealing directly with the company  developers feel more certain about the terms and timing of their financing 
the company believes the savings in time and up front costs and the certainty of execution that the direct purchase program offers to developers allows us to receive above market rates of interest on the company s revenue bonds 
in addition to investing in tax exempt revenue bonds secured by multifamily properties producing tax credits  the company may acquire other multifamily tax exempt bonds including those issued to finance low income multifamily projects and facilities for the elderly owned by section c not for profit organizations 
the company also has a portion of assets that produce a small amount of taxable income 
as a result of the acquisition of pwf  the company has diversified the range of the company s investment products and is able to offer developers fixed and floating rate tax exempt and taxable financing through fannie mae  freddie mac and  to a lesser extent  fha for affordable and market rate multifamily properties 
combining this with the company s core business of investing in revenue bonds and its affiliation with related capital  the company is able to provide developers with financing for all aspects of their property s capital structure 
in addition  the company has diversified its revenues with a fee business that will grow in value over time and will insulate the company from the vagaries of the capital markets 
on january   the company announced that its board of trustees had formed a special committee to explore strategic alternatives for the company s future management structure  including internalization of management  and ways to further diversify the company s revenue sources 
the special committee consists of the independent members of the board of trustees  peter t 
allen  arthur p 
fisch and charles l 
edson 
the special committee has retained independent counsel and expects to hire a financial advisor to assist them in this process

other than the preferred allocation of regulatory benefits  the preferred investors receive the same economic benefits as common shareholders of the company  including receipt of the same dividends per share as those paid to common shareholders

the owner trust contributes selected bonds to specific series trusts in order to segregate revenue bonds issued by governmental entities selected by state of origin 
as of december   four such series trusts were created two california only series and two national non state specific series 
each series trust  issues two equity certificates i a senior certificate which has been deposited into a certificate trust which issues and sells floater certificates representing proportional interests in the senior certificate to new investors and ii a residual certificate  issued to the origination trust which represents the remaining beneficial ownership interest in each series trust 
the effect of the top structure is that a portion of the interest received on revenue bonds in the owner trust is distributed through the senior certificate to the holders of the floater certificates with any remaining interest remitted to the origination trust and thus to the benefit of the company via the residual certificate 
the effect of the december   refinement of the top structure was to segregate the california related floater certificates as they generally will pay distributions at lower rates than national non state specific floater certificates and thus the yield on the residual certificates owned by the origination trust is increased

the p floats are sold to qualified third party  tax exempt investors and the rites are generally sold back to the company 
during the year  the company transferred revenue bonds with an aggregate face amount of approximately million to p floats rites sm program and received proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  the company repurchased five revenue bonds with an aggregate face value of approximately million 
the company s cost of funds relating to its secured borrowings under the merrill lynch p floats rites sm program calculated as interest expense as a percentage of the weighted average amount of the secured borrowings was approximately  and  annualized  for the years ended december  and and the period june  inception of this program through december   respectively

almost all of the company s recurring income is tax exempt and from time to time chartermac may sell or securitize various assets which may result in capital gains and losses 
this tax structure allows chartermac to have the pass through income characteristics as a partnership for both taxable and tax exempt income 
chartermac does not pay tax at the partnership level 
instead  the distributive share of chartermac s income  deductions and credits reported to each shareholder for inclusion on their respective income tax return 
the tax exempt income derived from most of chartermac s revenue bonds remains tax exempt as it is passed through to shareholders 
any cash dividends received by chartermac from subsidiaries  organized as corporations  will be recorded as dividend income for tax purposes such subsidiaries  created in  distributed no dividends during 
approximately  and of chartermac s tax basis income for the years ended december   and  respectively  was tax exempt for federal income tax purposes 
during  the company restructured its operations into two segments  an investing segment and an operating segment 
the investing segment invests primarily in tax exempt revenue bonds 
the operating segment  which is directly and wholly owned by chartermac  generates taxable investment and fee income through direct investment or through its pwf subsidiary 
the company provides for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes fas 
fas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company derives a substantial portion of its income from ownership of first mortgage private activity bonds 
the interest from these bonds is generally tax exempt from regular federal income tax 
however  the tax reform act of classifies the interest earned on private activity bonds issued after august  as a tax preference item for alternative minimum tax purposes amt 
the percentage of the company s tax exempt interest income subject to amt for the years ended december   and was approximately  and respectively 
amt is a mechanism within the internal revenue code to ensure that all taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of taxes 
all taxpayers are subject to the amt calculation requirements although the vast majority of taxpayers will not actually pay amt 
as a result of amt  the percentage of the company s income that is exempt from federal income tax may be different for each shareholder depending on that shareholder s individual tax situation 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 business combinations sfas and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
these statements establish new standards for accounting and reporting for business combinations and for goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations 
sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after june   the company implemented sfas on january  the company has determined that the amount it has currently capitalized as goodwill from business combinations prior to pwf approximately million at december  will meet the criteria in sfas for recognition as an intangible asset apart from goodwill and  accordingly  continue to be amortized over its expected useful life  subject to impairment testing 
the goodwill capitalized as part of the pwf acquisition approximately million will not be amortized  but will be reviewed annually to determine whether or not any impairment exists 
thus  implementation of these statements did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june of  the fasb issued sfas no   accounting for asset retirement obligations effective january  and  in august of  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets effective january  
sfas no 
requires the recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
sfas no 
supercedes existing accounting literature dealing with impairment and disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
it addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and expands current reporting for discontinued operations to include disposals of a component of an entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
management believes the implementation of these two statements will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests in certain financial instruments  primarily revenue bonds and other bond related investments that are subject to various forms of market risk  including real estate risk  interest rate risk  credit and liquidity risk and prepayment risk 
the company seeks to prudently and actively manage such risks to earn sufficient compensation to justify the undertaking of such risks and to maintain capital levels which are commensurate with the risks the company undertakes 
real estate risk the company derive income by investing in revenue bonds secured by multifamily residential properties 
investing in such revenue bonds collateralized by such properties subjects the company to various types and degrees of risk that could adversely affect the value of the company s assets and the company s ability to generate revenue 
the factors that may reduce the company s revenues  net income and cash available for distributions to shareholders include the following the property securing a revenue bond may not generate income sufficient to meet its operating expenses and debt service on its related revenue bond  economic conditions  either local  regional or national  may limit the amount of rent that can be charged for rental units at the properties  and may result in a reduction in timely rent payments or a reduction in occupancy levels  occupancy and rent levels may be affected by construction of additional housing units and national  regional and local politics  including current or future rent stabilization and rent control laws and agreements  federal lihtc and city  state and federal housing subsidy or similar programs which apply to many of the properties  could impose rent limitations and adversely affect the ability to increase rents to maintain the properties in proper condition during periods of rapid inflation or declining market value of such properties  and  if a revenue bond defaults  the value of the property securing such revenue bond plus  for properties that have availed themselves of the federal lihtc  the value of such credit may be less than the face amount of such revenue bond 
all of these conditions and events may increase the possibility that a property owner may be unable to meet its obligations to the company under its mortgage revenue bond 
this could affect the company s net income and cash available for distribution to shareholders 
the company manages these risks through diligent and comprehensive underwriting  asset management and ongoing monitoring of loan performance 
the company may be adversely affected by periods of economic or real estate downturns that result in declining property performance or property values 
any material decline in property values used as collateral for the company s revenue bonds increases the possibility of a loss in the event of default 
additionally  some of the company s income may come from additional interest received from the participation of a portion of the cash flow  sale or refinancing proceeds on underlying properties 
the collection of such additional interest may decrease in periods of economic slowdown due to lower cash flows or values available from the properties 
in a few instances  the revenue bonds are subordinated to the claims of other senior interest and uncertainties may exist as to a borrower s ability to meet principal and interest payments 
because of these economic factors  debt service on the revenue bonds  and therefore net income and cash available for distribution to shareholders is dependent on the performance of the underlying properties 
interest rate risk the nature of the company s investments and the instruments used to raise capital for their acquisition expose the company to income and expense volatility due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
the revenue bonds generally bear interest at fixed rates  or pay interest according to the cash flows of the underlying properties  which do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in contrast  payments required under the top program and on the secured borrowings under the p float program vary based on market interest rates based on the bond market association bma index and are re set weekly 
the company  through its cm corp 
subsidiary  has floating rate debt related to the acquisition financing of pwf 
pwf has loans receivable and short term borrowings related to its mortgage origination operations which are not expected to subject pwf to significant interest rate risk 
pwf typically provides mortgages to borrowers mortgages receivable by borrowing from third parties short term borrowings 
as mortgages receivable are typically subject to a take out commitment by fannie mae  freddie mac or fha  the related borrowings to finance such mortgages are typically short term 
the interest income or expense that represents the difference between the interest charged to borrowers and the interest paid to pwf s lender during the warehousing period will be earned by pwf 
other long term sources of capital  such as the company s various series of cumulative preferred shares  carry a fixed dividend rate and so are not impacted by changes in market interest rates 
a rising interest rate environment could reduce the demand for multifamily tax exempt and taxable financing  which could limit the company s ability to invest in revenue bonds or to structure transactions 
conversely  falling interest rates may prompt historical renters to become homebuyers  in turn potentially reducing the demand for multifamily housing 
an effective interest rate management strategy can be complex and no strategy can insulate the company from all potential risks associated with interest rate changes 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow company management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
prior to december   management did not engage in any of these hedging strategies after careful analysis and due to its low leverage 
however  beginning in  and upon management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies  the company entered into interest rate swaps in order to hedge against increases in the floating interest rate on its top and p floats programs 
on january   the company entered into a five year interest swap that fixes the bma index to on a notional amount of million 
on february   the company entered into a three year interest swap that fixes the bma index to on a notional amount of an additional million 
interest rate swap agreements are subject to risk of early termination by the company or the counterparty  possibly at times unfavorable to the company and  depending on market conditions at the time  may result in the recognition of a significant gain or loss from changes in the market value of the hedging instrument 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire hedging instruments at favorable prices  or at all  when the existing arrangements expire or are terminated which would then fully expose the company to interest rate risk to the extent of the balance of debt subject to such hedges 
in addition  there is no assurance that the counterparty to these hedges will have the capacity to pay or perform under the stated terms of the interest rate swap agreement  however  the company seeks to enter into such agreements with reputable and investment grade rated counterparties to mitigate this risk 
with respect to the portion of the company s floating rate financing programs which are not hedged  a change in the bma rate would result in increased or decreased payments under these financing programs  without a corresponding change in cash flows from the investments in revenue bonds 
for example  based on the unhedged million million outstanding under these financing programs at december   less the million notional amount subsequently hedged and assuming a perfect hedge correlation the company estimates that an increase of in the bma rate would decrease the company s annual net income by approximately  conversely  a decrease in market interest rates would generally benefit the company in the same amount described above  as a result of decreased allocations to the minority interest and interest expense without corresponding decreases in interest received on revenue bonds 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended and interpreted  on january  accordingly  the company has documented its established policy for risk management and its objectives and strategies for the use of derivative instruments to potentially mitigate such risks 
currently  the company has a strategy to reduce its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps 
at inception  the company designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges on the variable interest payments on its floating rate financing 
accordingly  the interest rate swaps are recorded at their fair market values each accounting period  with changes in market values being recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective in achieving offsetting cash flows 
the company assesses  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether the swap agreements are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged financing 
any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is recorded in earnings 
there was no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship during  and the company expects that these hedging relationships will be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flow throughout their terms 
net amounts payable or receivable under the swap agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
at december   the combined fair market value of the two interest rate swaps was a liability of  included in interest rate swaps on the consolidated balance sheet 
interest paid or payable under the terms of the swaps  of  is included in interest expense for the year ended december  changes in market interest rates would also impact the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio of revenue bonds 
the company estimates the fair value for each revenue bond as the present value of its expected cash flows  using a discount rate for comparable tax exempt investments 
therefore  as market interest rates for tax exempt investments increase  the estimated fair value of the company s revenue bonds will generally decline  and a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in an increase in their estimated fair values 
for example  the company projects that a increase in market rates for tax exempt investments would decrease the estimated fair value of its portfolio of revenue bonds from its december  value of  to approximately  a decline in interest rates would increase the value of the december  portfolio to approximately  changes in the estimated fair value of the revenue bonds do not impact the company s reported net income  earnings per share  distributions or cash flows  but are reported as components of other comprehensive income and affect reported shareholders equity 
changes in interest rates would also affect both the pwf acquisition loan with fleet and the pwf warehouse lines 
each loan is tied to libor 
a change in libor would affect the company s annual net income by approximately  based on the outstanding balances at december  of approximately million for the pwf acquisition loan and million for the warehouse line 
in using this valuation model  the company incorporated assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income 
the company estimates the term of servicing for each loan by assuming that servicing would not end prior to the yield maintenance date  at which point the prepayment penalty expires 
the company provides an estimated default amount to be deducted in each year based on the borrower s debt service ratio 
the debt service ratio is a measurement of the amount of excess cash flow a borrower has to make monthly mortgage payments 
purchased servicing rights are measured initially at the price paid  which approximates fair value 
mortgage servicing rights msr s are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
the assumptions related to the foregoing discussion of market risk involve judgments involving future economic market conditions  future corporate decisions and other interrelating factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company and all of which are difficult or impossible to predict with accuracy 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking information are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking information included herein will prove to be accurate 
due to the significant uncertainties inherent in forward looking information  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation of the company that the objectives and plans of the company would be achieved 
liquidity risk the company s investments generally lack a regular trading market  particularly during turbulent market conditions or if any of the company s tax exempt revenue bonds become taxable or are in default 
there is no limitation as to the percentage of investments that may be illiquid and the company does not expect to invest a substantial portion of its assets in liquid investments 
there is a risk involved in investing in illiquid investments  particularly in the event that the company needs additional cash 
in a situation requiring additional cash  the company could be forced to liquidate some of its investments on unfavorable terms that could substantially impact the company s balance sheet and reduce the amount of distributions available and payments made in respect of the company s shares 
risk associated with securitization through securitizations  the company seeks to enhance its overall return on its investments and to generate proceeds that  along with equity offering proceeds  facilitate the acquisition of additional investments 
in the company s debt securitizations  an investment bank and or credit enhancer provides liquidity to the underlying trust and credit enhancement to the bonds  which enables the senior interests to be sold to certain accredited third party investors seeking investments rated aa or better 
the liquidity facilities are generally for one year terms and are renewable annually 
to the extent that the credit enhancer is downgraded below aa  either an alternative credit enhancement provider would be substituted to reinstate the desired investment rating or the senior interests would be marketed to other accredited investors 
in either case  it is anticipated that the return on the residual interests would decrease  which would negatively impact the company s income 
if the company is unable to renew the liquidity or credit enhancement facilities  the company would be forced to find alternative liquidity or credit enhancement facilities  repurchase the underlying bonds or liquidate the underlying bonds and its investment in the residual interests 
if the company is forced to liquidate its investment  the company would recognize gains or losses on the liquidation  which may be significant depending on market conditions 
as of december   million of the senior interests were subject to annual rollover renewal for liquidity and credit enhancement  respectively 
of the million  million is credit enhanced by a longer term facility by mbia 
the company continues to review alternatives that would reduce and diversify risks associated with securitization
