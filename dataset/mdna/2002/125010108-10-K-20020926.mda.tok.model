item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  and market network distribution and transmission products and provide services and operational support systems to operators of advanced hybrid fiber coax broadband networks 
we operate in three industry segments broadband communications products  broadband network services  and broadband management solutions 
as a result of a corporate reorganization during fiscal year  our segments reflect a reporting change made as of june   whereby our business is now conducted through three divisions  each focused on a business segment 
as a result of this change  our former telecommunications equipment segment has been renamed the broadband communications products segment 
in addition  our broadband network services and broadband management solutions segments previously were consolidated under the broadband management services segment 
all prior period segment data has been restated to reflect these changes 
for additional information regarding our business segments  see note s to the consolidated financial statements 
our broadband communications products division is responsible for research  development  management  production  support  and sales of advanced fiber optic and radio frequency equipment 
our broadband network services division provides outsourced technical services  including network engineering and design  construction  activation  optimization  certification  maintenance  and operations 
our broadband management solutions division is responsible for the development  integration  management  implementation  support and sales of operational support systems that focus on network services management and mobile workforce management solutions 
business combinations on july   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company acquired the stock of aerotec communications  inc aerotec for million 
these assets became part of the broadband network services division 
the company had recorded goodwill of  as of june  in connection with this transaction  which represented the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value of the acquired net assets of the business 
additional cash payments of up to million were required to be made to aerotec shareholders if certain performance targets were met 
these performance targets were substantially achieved and an additional cash payment of million was made in august and recorded as additional goodwill 
on august   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of adc telecommunications  inc adc 
the assets and operations acquired from adc were considered the purchase of a business and have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of purchase 
consideration for the acquisition was approximately million  consisting of a cash payment of million to adc and direct transaction costs incurred of approximately  in addition  we assumed certain liabilities 
we used our available cash to fund the acquisition 
the company had recorded goodwill of million as of june  in connection with this transaction  which represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value of the acquired net assets of the business 
the assets purchased include the optiworx tm and dv r series product lines  as well as other related cable infrastructure products from adc s broadband communications division  located in meriden  connecticut  buenos aires  argentina  and klagenfurt  austria 
these facilities and their assets became part of the company s broadband communications products division 
on february   the company announced the closing of the buenos aires  argentina  manufacturing facility 
subsequent event in september  we completed our purchase of certain assets and liabilities of philips broadband networks pbn from royal philips electronics 
pbn is a provider of broadband products  including transmission products  network optimizing technologies  and element management systems 
pbn is supported by sales and services organizations worldwide  with a strong customer base in europe and the asia pacific region 
the purchase includes assets in various countries  cable infrastructure products  and a design and production facility in manlius  new york 
these assets and the facility became part of our broadband communications products division 
the purchase price for the acquisition was million euros  subject to certain adjustments 
the closing took place on september  with an effective date of the acquisition of august  the results of operations of pbn will be included in the consolidated financial statements as of august  at closing on september   the company made an initial payment of million euros  with subsequent payments subject to certain adjustments 
the acquisition is being accounted for as a purchase 
any excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value of the acquired net assets of the business will be recorded as goodwill 
non recurring and other restructuring related charges we implemented various initiatives during fiscal year to consolidate our manufacturing operations  improve our operating performance  and align our cost structure with current business levels 
as a result  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
these were partially offset by a reversal of  for previously recorded restructuring charges incurred in fiscal year  related to consolidation efforts at our pennsylvania and georgia facilities 
the result is a net charge in fiscal year of million 
our restructuring costs primarily related to involuntary workforce reduction costs of million for approximately employees  fixed asset write downs of  and cancellation costs associated with fixed contractual obligations of  the amount accrued as of june  of million will be substantially paid out by december  we intend to continue our initiative to achieve more cost efficient operations through the integration of our acquisition of pbn and evaluation of business operating levels in fiscal year our overall restructuring initiative may result in additional restructuring expenses in amounts that have not yet been determined 
on february   we announced the closing of our buenos aires  argentina  manufacturing facility 
this action completed the final step of the integration of assets purchased from adc in august the decision to close the argentina manufacturing facility was a result of the process we began  as of the acquisition date  to address redundancy in the product lines and manufacturing capacity resulting from the acquisition 
we substantially ceased manufacturing operations at this facility as of march fair value adjustments for inventory and fixed assets of million and exit costs of million were accounted for as an adjustment to the allocation of the original purchase price and were recorded as additional goodwill 
in addition  as a result of the substantial liquidation of the operation  we realized a translation loss of  related to the devaluation of the argentine peso in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge of million for goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisition of mobileforce in fiscal year the impairment was based upon a write down of these assets to their estimated fair value  based upon the projected recoverability of these intangible assets through an analysis of expected future cash flows 
in accordance with our ordinary business practices  projected future cash flows were discounted at a rate corresponding to our estimated cost of capital 
on june   adelphia communications adelphia  a major customer  filed a petition for protection under the federal bankruptcy statutes 
as of june   the company had outstanding accounts receivables of million related to adelphia and affiliated companies 
a charge off to bad debts of million was recorded as of june   due to management s assessment that these accounts receivables are likely not recoverable 
this charge is included in selling and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable period 
management bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions  and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are 
revenue recognition 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
valuation of inventories 
valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets 
restructuring costs 
warranty liabilities 
accounting for income taxes different assumptions and judgments would change estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sale price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenues derive principally from equipment sales  which are generally recognized when the equipment has been shipped 
service revenues  consisting of system design  field services  and other consulting engagements  are generally recognized as services are rendered in accordance with the terms of contracts 
for our software licensing arrangements involving multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair values of the elements 
license revenue allocated to software products  under certain terms and conditions  is recognized upon the delivery of the software products 
for certain of our software license arrangements where professional services are being provided that are deemed to be essential to the functionality or are for significant production  modification  or customization of the software product  both the software product revenue and the professional service revenue are recognized on the completed contract method as the arrangements represent our initial installations  and the company does not have the ability to reasonably estimate contract costs at the inception of the contracts 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized when the contract is complete  and all direct costs and related revenues are deferred until that time 
the entire amount of an estimated loss on a contract is accrued at the time a loss on a contract is projected 
revenue recognition in each period is dependent on application of these accounting policies 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we establish a general allowance for doubtful accounts based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and historical payment experience 
in addition  we establish allowances to charge off specifically identified doubtful accounts for the amount deemed worthless when a loss is deemed to be both probable and estimable 
in the event that we have an unexpected problem collecting from one of our major customers and our actual bad debts differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our established reserves may be insufficient and recognition of additional reserves could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales and usage  current economic trends  forecasted sales  product lifecycles  and current inventory levels 
this evaluation requires us to make estimates regarding future events in an industry where rapid technological changes are prevalent 
in the event that we adjust our estimates  such as forecasted sales and expected product lifecycles  the value of our inventory may be under or overstated and recognition of such under or overstatement will affect our cost of sales in a future period  which could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we assess goodwill  other intangible assets  and other long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  other intangible assets  and other long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method to determine fair value with a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
when impairment is determined  it is recorded as a charge against earnings in the period when recognized 
restructuring costs 
in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  we record restructuring costs when the company commits to an exit plan and significant changes to the exit plan are not likely 
we estimate the future amounts to be incurred as a result of an exit plan and record the amounts as a charge against earnings 
for additional information regarding restructuring costs  refer to note c of our consolidated financial statements 
revisions to our estimates could result in an additional charge to earnings or a reversal of previous recorded charges  which could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions change 
warranty liabilities 
we warranty our products against defects in materials and workmanship  generally for three to five years  depending upon product lines 
a provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty activities is recorded when the product is shipped  based upon our historical experience 
in addition  the recorded amount is adjusted for specifically identified warranty exposures 
in the event that our historical claims experience changes or our estimates relating to probable losses resulting from specifically identified warranty exposure change  our reserves may not be sufficient and a charge against future cost of sales may materially affect our operating results and financial position 
accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current income tax payable and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
significant management judgment is required for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
results of operations the company s consolidated statements of operations from continuing operations for fiscal years   and as a percentage of net sales  are as follows year ended june  june  june  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses selling and administrative research and product development amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 

goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges acquired in process technology charge 

merger and restructuring costs total operating expenses income loss from continuing operations interest and other income expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year broadband communications products segment sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year demand increased from both domestic and international cable operators compared to a year ago when broadband communications products sales declined as a result of a sharp slowdown of capital spending in the telecommunications industry 
in general  we believe increased spending for network system upgrades during the year was driven by requirements for higher bandwidth products to support new two way services 
contributing to the sales growth were incremental sales resulting from our acquisition of certain assets of adc  primarily for optical product lines 
the company continues to see shifts in product requirements to optical products from radio frequency amplifiers  including digital technology  for transporting voice  video  and data 
optical product sales were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year sales of radio frequency amplifiers decreased  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year broadband network services segment sales remained relatively flat at million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year sales were primarily attributable to technical services performed in our customers plants  including system sweep  reverse path activation  ingress mitigation  node certification  and system maintenance 
broadband management solutions segment sales also remained relatively flat at million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year sales were primarily attributable to mobile workforce software licenses and professional services 
domestic sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from an increase in broadband communications products segment sales  due to the increased capital spending by certain domestic multiple system operators msos 
included in the domestic sales for fiscal year  were million of sales to adelphia 
on june   adelphia filed a petition for protection under the federal bankruptcy statutes  and as such  we do not anticipate any significant new orders in the near term from adelphia 
total domestic sales were of consolidated net sales for both fiscal years and international sales increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase resulted from an increase in broadband communications products segment sales in europe  asia  and latin america during the year 
as a result of our acquisition of certain assets and operations of adc  we benefited from expansion of our customer base in europe and added an operation in klagenfurt  austria 
this operation includes manufacturing  engineering  sales and administrative support activities to provide localized versions of products and services to customers in europe 
we expect the demand for our products in international markets will continue to be highly variable 
the international markets represent distinct markets in which capital spending decisions for hybrid fiber coax network distribution equipment can be affected by a variety of factors  including access to financing and general economic conditions 
our total international sales were of consolidated net sales for both fiscal years and gross margin 
gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year for the broadband communications products segment  gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the improvement in broadband communications products segment gross margin was due primarily to product mix  which included higher sales of optical products which typically carry higher gross margins than radio frequency products  and improvements in our cost structure as a result of manufacturing consolidation efforts which began in the last half of fiscal year for the broadband network services segment  gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the decrease in broadband network services segment gross margin was due primarily to services mix 
broadband management solutions segment  gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year broadband management solutions segment gross margin was impacted negatively by increased costs associated with employees that support the deployment of network services management and mobile workforce management solutions which are included in cost of sales 
we anticipate that our future gross margin will continue to be affected by many factors  including sales mix  competitive pricing  the timing of new product introductions  and manufacturing volumes 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year included in selling and administrative expense for fiscal year was bad debt expense of million  which includes million for a specific charge off of accounts receivables from adelphia communications and affiliates  and million related to customers in latin america  where economic conditions affected the collection of certain outstanding accounts receivable 
selling and administrative expenses also increased during fiscal year due to personnel costs and administrative expenses related to our acquisitions of mobileforce technologies inc mobileforce in april  and certain operations of adc in august in addition  costs associated with the implementation of a fully integrated enterprise resource planning erp system were incurred during fiscal year the erp system is a software based management tool that will simplify and standardize business processes such as financial systems  manufacturing and purchasing  product development  and customer relationship management 
costs of million related to business process reengineering activities and training associated with this project were expensed as incurred in fiscal year implementation of the system was substantially complete as of june  research and product development 
research and product development expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year research and product development expenses in the broadband communications products segment were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from inclusion of certain operations of adc and additional expenses for the development of optical products 
research and product development expenses in the broadband management solutions segment were million in fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from our acquisition of mobileforce in april and additional expenses for the development of mobile workforce management software solutions 
other research and product development expenses  not charged to segments  were  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other costs associated with technology investigation and oversight functions 
we anticipate continuing investments in research and product development expenses in future periods related to ongoing initiatives in the development of optical products and network services management and mobile workforce software capabilities 
operating income loss by segment 
operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband communications products segment in fiscal year was million  compared to operating income of million in fiscal year the decrease in operating income for fiscal year was primarily attributable to bad debt expense of million related to adelphia and latin american customers during the year 
operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband network services segment in fiscal year was million  compared to operating income of million in fiscal year the operating loss for fiscal year derives primarily from a charge to bad debt expense of million related to adelphia 
operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband management solutions segment in fiscal year was million  compared to a loss of million in fiscal year the increased operating loss for fiscal year derives primarily from investment and development costs associated with our network services management products  as well as operating costs  including amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our mobileforce acquisition in april interest and investment income 
interest expense was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase in interest expense in fiscal year resulted primarily from interest on certain long term obligations 
investment income was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in investment income resulted from reduced investment balances compared to fiscal year and lower interest rates 
other income expense  net 
other income  net was million in fiscal year  compared to other expense  net of million in fiscal year other income  net for fiscal year included million for a gain related to the fair value of a foreign exchange forward contract  and  for net foreign currency transaction gains during the period 
this was offset by a provision for impairment of a note receivable of million from a third party 
in fiscal year  other expense primarily was comprised of a million write off of a long term investment 
income taxes 
our overall effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the effective income tax rate for fiscal year reflects the impact of us federal  foreign and state income taxes and changes in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
the lower effective income tax rate for fiscal year resulted primarily from an increase in the valuation allowance of million related to the tax benefits of losses in foreign jurisdictions and for state income tax purposes that may not be realized 
in addition  fluctuations in the effective income tax rate from period to period reflect changes in permanent differences  non deductible amounts  the relative profitability related to us versus non us operations and the differences in statutory tax rates by jurisdiction 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year broadband communications products segment sales decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decline in broadband communications products segment sales reflected the sharp slowdown of capital spending in the telecommunications industry that began in the latter part of calendar year  resulting from several factors  including high customer on hand inventory levels  delays in construction schedules for hybrid fiber coax network system build outs  customer consolidation  and lack of access to financing 
broadband network services segment sales remained relatively flat at million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year sales were primarily attributable to technical services performed in our customers plants  including system sweep  reverse path activation  ingress mitigation  node certification  and system maintenance 
broadband management solutions segment sales decreased slightly to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year domestic sales decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decline resulted primarily from a decrease in broadband communications products segment sales  due to the slowdown in capital spending by certain domestic multiple system operators msos 
total domestic sales were of net sales for fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year international sales decreased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was principally caused by a decline in broadband communications products segment sales to a major customer in canada 
our total international sales were of consolidated net sales in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year gross margin 
gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year for the broadband communications products segment  gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year in fiscal year  broadband communications products gross margin was negatively impacted from under absorbed manufacturing overhead resulting from lower production volumes and increased operating reserves for excess and obsolete inventories and warranty costs for equipment upgrades and replacements 
additions to the inventory reserve were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increase was necessary due to the slowdown in spending in the telecommunications industry 
for the broadband network services segment  gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the improvement in gross margin in the broadband network services segment was due primarily to services mix 
the gross margin in the broadband management solutions segment was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the decrease in broadband management solutions segment gross margin was due to lower margins on providing high speed data help desk services during the period 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to steps taken to reduce selling and administrative expenses  including personnel and other operating costs  to obtain a more favorable cost structure 
research and product development 
research and product development expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year research and product development expenses in the broadband communications products segment were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the increase in fiscal year derives from higher personnel costs and additional expenses primarily for the development of fiber optic transmission products 
research and product development expenses in the broadband management solutions segment were million in fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the increase in fiscal year derives from higher personnel costs resulting from our acquisition of mobileforce in april  and additional expenses related to continued development in network services management capabilities 
other research and product development expenses  not charged to segments  were  in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to reduced personnel and other costs associated with technology investigation and oversight functions 
operating income loss by segment 
operating income excluding unallocated items for the broadband communications products segment in fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in operating income for fiscal year was primarily attributable to decreased volume and lower gross margins 
operating income excluding unallocated items for the broadband network services segment in fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year the increase in operating income for fiscal year was primarily attributable to higher gross margins 
operating loss excluding unallocated items for the broadband management solutions segment in fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year the increased loss for fiscal year derives primarily from increased investment and development costs associated with our network management products  as well as operating costs  including amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our acquisition of mobileforce 
interest and investment income 
interest expense was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the decrease in interest expense in fiscal year resulted from reductions of borrowings on short term credit facilities and a decrease in the amortization related to the fair market value of warrants issued in fiscal year in connection with certain debt financing arrangements by silicon valley communications  inc  an entity acquired by the company in a pooling of interest transaction in september investment income was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increase in investment income in fiscal year resulted from investing the net proceeds received in a follow on public offering completed on november   in short term investments 
other expense  net 
other expense  net was million in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase in other expense  net for fiscal year resulted primarily from a charge of million for the impairment of a long term investment 
income taxes 
our overall effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the effective income tax rate for fiscal year reflects the impact of us federal  foreign and state income taxes and changes in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
the lower effective income tax rate for fiscal year resulted primarily from an adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to certain tax benefits from the acquisitions of convergence and svci  and was offset partially by permanent differences for non deductible business combination costs incurred with the mergers with convergence  svci and worldbridge broadband services  inc worldbridge 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  up from million at june  the increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from net proceeds received from the follow on public offering of common stock completed in february  whereby  shares of our common stock were sold at a price of per share 
this offering resulted in net proceeds after deducting issuance costs to the company of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal year  compared with cash provided by operations of million in fiscal year the increase in net cash used in operating activities during fiscal year was due primarily to the increased net loss incurred during the year  reductions in accrued liabilities  and increases in deferred income taxes 
these changes were partially offset by lower inventories and higher accounts payables 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year  compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal year the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was primarily due to utilizing million of cash for acquisitions  million to purchase marketable securities and other short term investments  as well as million to purchase property  plant and equipment during the year 
these were offset partially by proceeds of million from the sale of marketable securities and other short term investments in fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year  compared to cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal year the increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year resulted primarily from net proceeds in the amount of million received from our follow on public offering of common stock in february and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and warrants 
this was offset by cash used for the purchase of treasury stock of million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year our stock repurchase program allows for a total of  shares to be purchased 
shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market through block or privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
we intend to use our currently available capital resources to fund the purchases 
the repurchased stock is held by us as treasury stock to be used to meet our obligations under our present and future stock option plans and for other corporate purposes 
as of june    shares had been repurchased under the current stock repurchase program 
total shares held as treasury stock were  as of june  our other financing activities consisted primarily of payments on short term and long term debt 
on february   we entered into a new credit agreement with a bank 
under the new credit agreement  million is available as a revolving line of credit  subject to an aggregate sub limit of million for issuance of letters of credit 
the credit agreement is committed through september  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at various rates  at our option 
the company is subject to a quarterly minimum net worth and liquidity test 
as a consequence of the operating loss incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company would not have been in compliance with the minimum net worth test  and received a waiver with respect to this covenant as of june  as of june   we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement and had established letters of credit of million outstanding related to our workers compensation programs and customer obligations 
information regarding our contactual obligations are as follows expected cash payments by fiscal year and beyond in thousands contractual obligations long term debt operating leases    total contractual cash obligations    information regarding our commitments are as follows amount of commitments expiration by fiscal year and beyond in thousands other commitments standby letters of credit  total commitments  we believe that current cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances  which include the proceeds from our follow on offering in february  our expected federal income tax refund  as well as an anticipated extension of the commitment period for borrowing capacity under the credit agreement discussed above will be adequate to cover operating cash requirements and cash required for the acquisition of pbn over the next to months 
however  we still may find it necessary or desirable to seek other sources of financing to support our capital needs and provide available funds for working capital  or financing strategic initiatives  including acquiring or investing in complementary businesses  products  services  or technologies 
among alternatives that we believe are available as an additional source of financing is a fully secured revolving line of credit  however  we cannot offer any assurance that this source will be available on favorable terms 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations statement 
statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and requires that all business combinations within the scope of statement be accounted for using only the purchase method 
statement is applicable for all business combinations initiated after june also in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
statement addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of statement 
the company was required to adopt the provisions of statement as of july  and adopted statement effective june  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in purchase business combinations completed after june   but before statement is adopted in full  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre statement accounting literature 
in connection with statement s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement will require us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with statement the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption  we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million that will be subject to the transition provisions of statement because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statement  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting statement on our financial statements at the date of this report  including whether we will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement  which supersedes both statement and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
statement retains the fundamental provisions in statement for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with statement for example  statement provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
statement retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike statement  an impairment assessment under statement will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under statement we are required to adopt statement effective june  management does not expect the adoption of statement for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under statement is largely unchanged from statement the provisions of statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities statement  which replaces emerging issues task force no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit and activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan
