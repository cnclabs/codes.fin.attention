the court rule and judicial profile services generated about of the total circulation revenues  with the other newspapers and services accounting for the balance 
information system and service revenues increased by  primarily because of increased consulting revenues of sustain 
the company s revenues derived from sustain s operations constituted about and of the company s total revenues for fiscal and  respectively

these sustain internal development costs  primarily incremental costs  aggregated  for fiscal compared to  in fiscal during fiscal and  there were  of costs for the development of sustain software by an outside service provider 
in april  the company determined that this purchased software was not functioning as intended  and therefore the development efforts of the outside provider were discontinued  and its work was terminated 
the software development project was both seriously flawed and seriously behind schedule at the time of termination and was  therefore  of virtually zero commercial value 
as a result  the company wrote off and expensed in fiscal capitalized software development costs aggregating  the company also booked a net tax benefit of  in fiscal based on management s estimate of the timing of the utilization of tax benefits  for financial statement purposes  from overall losses attributable to the sustain segment 
in subsequent years there may be substantial additional tax benefits from past sustain segment losses 
to replace work of the terminated outside service provider  the company has expanded its consulting staff to meet its planned internal development efforts and has expanded relationships with other service providers 
if these replacement development programs are not successful  they will significantly and adversely impact the company s ability to maximize its existing investment in the sustain software  to service its existing customers  and to compete for new opportunities in the case management software business

commissions and other outside services decreased by  primarily because of fewer commissionable sales 
depreciation  amortization and goodwill impairment expenses increased by  which included the write off of sustain s remaining goodwill of  primarily due to management s review of sustain s losses in fiscal and the expected future cash flows

the company s expenditures in support of the sustain software were very high and grossly impacted overall results 
as of september   capitalized sustain software costs consisted of purchased software of  that was capitalized upon the acquisition of sustain and  for amounts capitalized related to the use of the outside service provider to further develop the software product 
in fiscal  the company invested an additional  in the development of system software representing costs related to the use of the outside service provider 
as a result of the flaws and problems related to the outside service provider discussed above  the company wrote off and expensed in fiscal capitalized software development costs aggregating  the company also booked a net tax benefit of  in fiscal based on management s estimate of the timing of the utilization of tax benefits  for financial statement purposes  from overall losses attributable to the sustain segment 
interest income decreased by  during fiscal to  from  primarily resulting from allocation of cash resources to the investment in sustain software

sustain s business segment pretax loss increased by  primarily because of the write offs of i the capitalized sustain software development costs of  and ii the remaining sustain goodwill of  as well as reduced consulting revenues 
the consolidated net loss for the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared with a consolidated net income of  in the prior fiscal year

there continue to be outstanding issues between sustain and the terminated outside service provider  including the amounts due to each of them from the other 
the terminated outside service provider filed for bankruptcy in december and stated in its filings with the us bankruptcy court that it was considering bringing a collection action against sustain 
if it does  sustain will assert counter claims that completely offset the terminated outside provider s claims 
sustain will vigorously defend any litigation or action brought by the terminated outside service provider  although no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of the dispute 
it is the opinion of management that adequate provision has been made for any amounts that may become due as a result of the dispute 
nonetheless  the pendency of these issues could have an impact on sustain s ability to attract new customers or work with its existing customers 
during fiscal  and very likely much longer  the company expects its total expenditures in support of the development of the sustain software to continue to be very significant 
as of september   the company had working capital of  before deducting the liability for deferred subscription revenues and other revenues of  which will be earned within one year

preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
management believes that accounting for capitalized software costs  income tax accounting and revenue recognition are critical accounting policies 
costs related to the research and development of new sustain software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized  subject to expected recoverability 
the company s expenditures in support of the sustain software are highly significant and will grossly impact overall results at least through fiscal  and very likely much longer
