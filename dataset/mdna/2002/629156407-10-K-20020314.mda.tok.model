item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventory reserves  impairments of investments in marketable equity securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  and the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable finished goods inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional finished goods inventory reserves may be required 
the company provides reserves for tools and supplies inventory generally based on both historical and expected future usage requirements 
the company owns investments in certain companies that are accounted for either as marketable equity securities or under the equity method 
for all of such investments  the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever it determines that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with applicable gaap requirement associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
the company records an accrual for environmental  legal  income tax and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable  and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
results of operations general the company s operations are conducted by kronos in the tio business segment 
as discussed below  average tio selling prices in billing currencies which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation decreased in compared with and increased in compared with kronos operating income declined million in compared with and increased million in compared with gross profit margins were in  in and in many factors influence tio pricing levels  including i industry capacity  ii worldwide demand growth  iii customer inventory levels and purchasing decisions and iv relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates

sales volume metric tons in thousands production volume metric tons in thousands production rate as a percent of capacity full kronos operating income in  including business interruption proceeds of million  was lower than  primarily due to lower average tio selling prices in billing currencies and lower sales and production volumes 
kronos operating income for was higher than due to higher average tio selling prices in billing currencies and higher production and sales volumes 
average tio selling prices in billing currencies during were lower than  with lower prices in all major regions 
pigment prices decreased from the preceding quarter during each quarter of  reversing the upward trend that began in the fourth quarter of and continued through the fourth quarter of the rate of price declines increased in the fourth quarter of to over the third quarter of  and december prices were lower than the average selling price for the quarter 
the average selling price in billing currencies in december was below the december average selling price 
the most significant price erosion during this time period occurred in the european and export markets 
tio average selling prices continued to trend downward in the first quarter of average tio selling prices in billing currencies in were higher than  with higher prices in all major regions 
industry wide demand was weak throughout as compared to and levels 
sales volume of  metric tons of tio in was lower than  primarily due to lower sales in europe and north america 
kronos sales volume in the fourth quarter of decreased from the fourth quarter of and from the third quarter of approximately one half of kronos tio sales volume was attributable to markets in europe with approximately attributable to north america  and the balance to other regions 
sales volume in was higher than  primarily due to higher sales in europe and north america 
industry wide demand was weak in early demand in the second half of and the first three quarters of was stronger than comparable year earlier periods as a result of  among other things  customers buying in advance of anticipated price increases 
demand softened in the fourth quarter of and weakened throughout the company s production volume was  metric tons in  a decrease of from a record  metric tons produced in operating rates were at in down from near full capacity in  primarily due to lost production resulting from the leverkusen fire and the company s decision to curtail production in the fourth quarter of as demand remained soft 
kronos production volume in increased compared with the  metric tons produced in operating rates in were 
production volume was curtailed in the beginning of the first quarter of in order to manage inventory levels 
finished goods inventory levels increased in the fourth quarter of and at the end of represented approximately two and one half months of sales 
the company settled the insurance coverage claim involving the leverkusen fire for million during the fourth quarter of million received as of december   with the remaining million received in january  of which million related to business interruption and million related to property damage  clean up costs and other extra expenses 
the company recognized a million pre tax gain in related to the property damage recovery after deducting million of clean up costs and other extra expenses incurred and the carrying value of assets destroyed in the fire 
the gain was excluded from the determination of operating income 
the million of business interruption proceeds recognized in were allocated between other income  excluding corporate  which reflects recovery of lost margin million and as a reduction of cost of sales to offset unallocated period costs million 
the business interruption insurance proceeds distorted kronos operating income margin percentage in as there were no sales associated with the lost margin operating income recognized 
no additional insurance recoveries related to the leverkusen fire are expected to be received 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s efforts to debottleneck kronos production facilities to meet long term demand continue to prove successful 
the company expects kronos production capacity of  metric tons at the end of will be increased to approximately  metric tons during  primarily at its chloride facilities  with moderate capital expenditures 
the company expects tio industry demand in will improve over levels  because it expects worldwide economic conditions to improve and customer inventory levels to increase 
kronos tio production volume in is expected to approximate kronos tio sales volume 
in january  kronos announced price increases in all major markets of approximately to above existing december prices  scheduled to be implemented late in the first quarter of and early in the second quarter of kronos is hopeful that it will realize such announced prices increases  but the extent to which kronos can realize these and possibly other price increases during will depend on improving market conditions and global economic recovery 
however  because tio prices were generally declining during all of  the company believes that its average prices in billing currencies will be significantly below its average prices  even if the recently announced price increases are realized 
overall  the company expects its tio operating income in will be significantly lower than  primarily due to lower average tio selling prices 
the company s expectations as to the future prospects of the company and the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond the company s control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the market place  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from the company s expectations  the company s results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  which reduced the company s expenses in both and compared to the year earlier periods  kronos cost of sales in was lower than due to lower sales volume partially offset by higher unit costs  which resulted primarily from lower production levels 
the effects of lower tio sales volume and production volume were partially offset by business interruption proceeds 
kronos cost of sales in was lower than primarily due to lower unit costs  which resulted primarily from higher production levels 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased in primarily due to the impact on net sales of lower average selling prices and higher unit costs partially offset by business interruption insurance recoveries  and decreased in primarily due to the impact on net sales of higher average selling prices and lower unit costs

the company has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally germany  norway  belgium and canada 
the company s non us sales and operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period revenues and expenses expressed in us dollars 
a significant amount of the company s sales in are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
certain purchases of raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  primarily a stronger us dollar compared to the euro  decreased sales by million and million during and  respectively  compared with the year earlier period 
when translated to us dollars using currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average selling prices for decreased from kronos average selling prices in us dollars for decreased from the effect of the stronger us dollar on kronos operating costs that are not denominated in us dollars reduced operating costs in and compared with the respective prior year 
in addition  sales to export markets are typically denominated in us dollars and a stronger us dollar improves margins on these sales at the company s us subsidiaries 
the favorable margin on export sales tends to offset the unfavorable effect of translating local currency profits to us dollars when the dollar is stronger 
as a result  the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income in and was not significant when compared to the year earlier periods

earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and the united kingdom pound sterling 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to the conversion of certain of these currencies to the euro 
at december   the company had million of indebtedness denominated in euros million and million of indebtedness denominated in norwegian kroner million 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates would be approximately million million 
marketable equity and marketable debt security prices the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable equity securities which are held 
the fair value of such equity securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million and million  respectively 
the fair value of marketable debt securities at december  was million 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments assuming a change in prices would be million 
the company did not hold any investments in marketable debt securities at december other the company believes there are certain shortcomings in the sensitivity analyses presented above  which analyses are required under the securities and exchange commission s regulations 
for example  the hypothetical affect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous parallel shifts along the yield curve 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions could differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events  gains or losses
