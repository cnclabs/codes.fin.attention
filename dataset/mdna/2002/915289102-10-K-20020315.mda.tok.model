these entities have approximately billion of their own debt obligations that are either fully non recourse to the company or the recourse is limited 
of the total billion in equity investee debt  billion belongs to the colonial pipeline company  in which unocal holds a percent equity interest 
the company guarantees only million of the total billion debt obligation see table above 
approximately million of the million in debt guarantees will be expiring in june the company also has other contingent liabilities with respect to certain of these entities which on the basis of management s best assessment  are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or liquidity 
the company has a percent interest in an affiliate  dayabumi salak pratama  ltd 
dspl  a company which sells electricity generated from geothermal steam in indonesia  that it accounts for under the equity method 
unocal made an initial million equity investment in this entity and has outstanding advances of million covering steam sales 
at december   dspl had outstanding third party debt of approximately million 
this debt is non recourse to the company 
the company s indonesian geothermal business has certain outstanding receivables from dspl see the discussion under geothermal and power operations in the outlook section of management s discussion and analysis through xx 
management believes that even if the debt obligations of dspl were required to be recorded on the balance sheet of the company  due to any future changes in accounting rules  the amounts would not have a material impact on the company s liquidity 
the company has also committed approximately million for its portion of the development costs for the mad dog discovery in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
in addition  the company has committed up to million for its share of the costs to develop the azerbaijan international operating company aioc s phase i of offshore oil reserves in the caspian sea as well as approximately million to develop the west seno field  offshore east kalimantan in indonesia 
critical accounting and other policies in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued a release regarding the selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and practices by public companies 
the sec encouraged companies to include in the management s discussion and analysis md a section a discussion of the effects of critical accounting policies applied  the judgments made in their application  and the likelihood of materially different reported results if different assumptions were to prevail 
the following discussion represents management s view of accounting policies and practices that are critical for the company 
oil and gas accounting the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas activities 
this accounting principle  among other things  requires that the capitalized costs for proved oil and gas properties be amortized on the basis of oil equivalent barrels that are produced in a period as a percentage of the total estimated proved reserves 
if reserve estimates are revised downward  earnings could be affected by higher depreciation and depletion expense or an immediate write down of the property s book value see impairments discussion below 
another element that is critical and could cause material fluctuations in earnings relates to the disposition of exploratory oil and gas well expenditures under successful efforts accounting 
if an exploratory well results in discovery of commercial reserves  the well investment is transferred to proven properties at the time reserves are booked 
exploratory wells that are non commercial are expensed as dry hole costs 
the carrying values of exploratory leasehold interests are regularly assessed 
the amortization of such costs is provided over the shorter of the exploratory program or contract holding period based on exploration experience and management s judgment as to local market conditions and other factors 
oil and gas reserves estimates of physical quantities of oil and gas reserves are determined by company engineers and in some cases by third party experts 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
accordingly  these estimates do not include probable or possible reserves 
estimated oil and gas reserves are based on available reservoir data and are subject to future revision 
significant portions of the company s undeveloped reserves  principally in offshore areas  require the installation or completion of related infrastructure facilities such as platforms  pipelines  and the drilling of development wells 
proved reserve quantities exclude royalty and other interests owned by others 
the company reports all reserves held under production sharing contracts pscs utilizing the economic interest method  which excludes host country shares 
estimated quantities for pscs reported under the economic interest method are subject to fluctuations in the price of oil and gas and recoverable operating expenses and capital costs 
if costs remain stable  reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices 
this change would be partially offset by a change in the company s net equity share 
impairment of assets oil and gas developed and undeveloped properties are regularly assessed for possible impairment  generally on a field by field basis where applicable  using the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of each field 
impairment losses are recognized when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the current net book values of the properties in a field 
the measurement amount to be recorded is based on expected discounted future cash flows 
the expected future cash flows are estimated based on management s plans to continue to produce and develop proved and associated risk adjusted probable and possible reserves 
expected future cash flows from the sale or production of reserves are calculated based on management s best estimate of future oil and gas prices using market based information 
the estimated future level of production is based on assumptions surrounding future commodity prices  lifting and development costs  field decline rates  market demand and supply  the economic regulatory climates and other factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for details on impairments 
environmental and litigation company management also makes judgments and estimates pursuant to applicable accounting rules in recording costs and establishing reserves for environmental clean up and remediation and potential costs of litigation matters 
for environmental reserves  actual costs can differ from estimates because of changes in laws and regulations  discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in clean up technology 
for additional details  refer to the ensuing environmental matters discussion and notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
actual litigation costs can vary from estimates based on the facts and circumstances in the application of laws in the individual cases 
environmental matters the company continues to incur substantial capital and operating expenditures for environmental protection and to comply with federal  state and local laws  as well as foreign laws  regulating the discharge of materials into the environment and management of hazardous and other waste materials 
in many cases  investigatory or remedial work is now required at various sites even though past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable under environmental laws and regulations  if any  existing at the time 
estimated years ended december  millions of dollars environmental related capital expenditures continuing operations discontinued operations environmental related capital expenditures include additions and modifications to company facilities to mitigate and or eliminate emissions and waste generation 
most of these capital expenditures are required to comply with federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations 
amounts recorded for environmental related expenses were approximately million in  million in and million in environmental expenses include provisions for remediation and operating  maintenance and administrative expenses that were identified during the company s ongoing review of its environmental obligations 
the higher expenses were due partially to additional remediation provisions recorded for the cleanup of service station sites  distribution facilities and central california oil and gas fields formerly operated by the company 
higher expenses were also due to additional provisions that were recorded for remediation liabilities related to agricultural chemical sites sold by the company in the higher expenses were due primarily to additional remediation provisions recorded for sites of the company s molycorp subsidiary  closed sites in central california and refining  marketing and distribution sites that were sold in at december   the company s reserve for environmental remediation obligations totaled million  of which million was included in current liabilities 
the total amount is grouped into the following four categories reserve summary at december  millions of dollars superfund and similar sites active company facilities company facilities sold with retained liabilities and former company operated sites inactive or closed company facilities total reserves superfund and similar sites at year end  unocal had received notification from the us environmental protection agency that the company may be a potentially responsible party prp at sites and may share certain liabilities at these sites 
in addition  various state agencies and private parties had identified other similar prp sites that may require investigation and remediation 
of the total  the company has denied responsibility at two sites and at another five sites the company s liability  although unquantified  appears to be de minimis 
the total also includes sites  which are under investigation or litigation  for which the company s potential liability is not presently determinable 
at another two sites  the company has made settlement payments and is in the final process of resolving its liabilities 
of the remaining sites  where probable costs can be estimated  reserves of million have been established for future remediation and settlement costs 
these sites exclude sites where the company s liability has been settled  or where the company has no evidence of liability and there has been no further indication of liability by government agencies or third parties for at least a month period 
unocal does not consider the number of sites for which it has been named a prp as a relevant measure of liability 
although the liability of a prp is generally joint and several  the company is usually just one of several companies designated as a prp 
the company s ultimate share of the remediation costs at those sites often is not determinable due to many unknown factors as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the solvency of other responsible parties and disputes regarding responsibilities may also impact the company s ultimate costs 
active company facilities the company has a reserve of million for estimated future costs of remedial orders  corrective actions and other investigation  remediation and monitoring obligations at certain operating facilities and producing oil and gas fields 
also included in this category are the questa molybdenum mine in new mexico and the mountain pass  california  lanthanide facility  both operated by the company s molycorp subsidiary 
company facilities sold with retained liabilites and former company operated sites company facilities sold with retained liabilities include certain sites of the company s former west coast refining  marketing and transportation business sold in march  auto truckstop facilities  industrial chemical and polymer sites and agricultural chemical sites 
in each sale  the company retained a contractual remediation or indemnification obligation and is responsible only for certain environmental problems associated with its past operations 
the reserves represent presently estimated future costs for investigation feasibility studies and identified remediation work as a result of claims made by buyers of the properties 
former company operated sites include service stations  distribution facilities and oil and gas fields that were previously operated but not owned by the company 
the company has an aggregate reserve of million for this category 
inactive or closed company facilities reserves of million have been established for these types of facilities 
the major sites in this category are the former guadalupe field site  molycorp s washington and york facilities in pennsylvania and a former refinery in beaumont  texas 
the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  as amended  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and laws governing low level radioactive materials 
under these laws  the company is subject to possible obligations to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of certain chemical  petroleum and radioactive substances at various sites 
corrective investigations and actions pursuant to rcra are being performed at the company s beaumont  texas facility  the company s closed shale oil project  a former agricultural chemical facility in corcoran  california and molycorp s washington  pennsylvania facility 
in addition  molycorp is required to decommission its washington and york facilities in pennsylvania and its louviers  colorado facility pursuant to the terms of their respective radioactive source materials licenses and decommissioning plans 
the company also must provide financial assurance for future closure and post closure costs of its rcra permitted facilities and for decommissioning costs at facilities that are under radioactive source materials licenses 
pursuant to a settlement agreement between the company and the state of california and the subsequent stipulated judgment entered by a superior court  the company must provide financial assurance for anticipated costs of remediation activities at the guadalupe oil field in california 
also  pursuant to a settlement agreement between molycorp and the california department of toxic substances control and subsequent final judgment entered by a superior court  the company must provide financial assurance for anticipated costs of disposing certain wastes  as well as closing facilities associated with the handling of those wastes  at molycorp s mountain pass  california  facility 
because these costs will be incurred at different times and over a period of many years  the company believes that these obligations are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the total environmental remediation reserves recorded on the consolidated balance sheet represent the company s estimates of assessment and remediation costs based on currently available facts  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
the remediation cost estimates  in many cases  are based on plans recommended to the regulatory agencies for approval and are subject to future revisions 
the ultimate costs to be incurred will likely exceed the total amounts reserved  since many of the sites are relatively early in the remedial investigation or feasibility study phases 
additional liabilities may be accrued as the assessment work is completed and formal remedial plans are formulated 
the company has estimated  to the extent that it was able to do so  that it could incur approximately million of additional costs in excess of the million accrued at december  the amount of such possible additional costs reflects  in most cases  the high end of the range of costs of feasible alternatives identified by the company for those sites with respect to which investigation or feasibility studies have advanced to the stage of analyzing such alternatives 
however  such estimated possible additional costs are not an estimate of the total remediation costs beyond the amounts reserved  because at a large number of sites the company is not yet in a position to estimate all  or in some cases any  possible additional costs 
both the amounts reserved and estimates of possible additional costs may change in the near term  in some cases  substantially  as additional information becomes available regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  required or agreed upon remediation methods and other actions by government agencies and private parties 
the company has posted various bonds and letters of credit for environmental obligations 
a complete discussion on these types of financial commitments can be found under long term debt and other financial commitments in md a 
also see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information on environmental related matters 
outlook the company is focused on striking the right balance between near term returns and long term value added growth from its exploration portfolio 
the company intends to accomplish this by maintaining strict discipline in its capital spending 
in total  more than percent of the capital spending plan targets oil and gas exploration and production projects 
the company will also closely manage its operating and administrative costs 
this is expected to help the company keep its balance sheet strong for maximum financial flexibility 
volatile energy prices are expected to continue to impact financial results in the year the company expects energy prices to remain volatile due to changes in climate conditions  worldwide demand  crude oil and natural gas inventory levels  production quotas set by opec  current and future worldwide political instability and security and other factors

the company estimates that net worldwide daily production for will be essentially the same as the  barrels of oil equivalent boe per day level achieved in the company expects its net earnings per share to be between to in the forecast for full year earnings assumes average nymex benchmark prices of per barrel of crude oil and per million british thermal units mmbtus for north america natural gas 
these price assumptions are based on year to date actual prices and the nymex strip for the remainder of the year 
earnings are expected to change cents per share for every change in the company s average worldwide realized price for crude oil and cents per share for every cent change in the company s average realized north america natural gas price 
the forecast also includes pre tax dry hole costs of to million to success rate 
net earnings are expected to change cents per share for each percent change in the overall success rate of the company s exploration drilling program

set forth below are additional important factors but not necessarily all of such factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
commodity prices a decline in the prices for crude oil  natural gas or other hydrocarbon commodities sold by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  on the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that could be economically produced from its fields  and on the quantities and economic values of its proved reserves and potential resources 
such adverse pricing scenarios could result in write downs of the carrying values of the company s properties  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  as well as its results of operations 
exploration and production risks the amounts of the company s future crude oil and natural gas reserves and production will also be affected by its ability to replace declining reservoirs in existing fields with new reserves through its exploration and development programs and through acquisitions 
the ability of the company to replace reserves will depend not only on its ability to obtain acreage and contracts in the countries in which it currently operates  as well as in new countries  and to delineate prospects which prove to be successful geologically  but also to drill  find  develop and produce recoverable quantities of oil and gas economically in the price environment prevailing at the time 
the exploration for oil and gas is a high risk business in which significant numbers of dry holes and high associated costs can be incurred in the processes of seeking commercial discoveries 
the company s exploration and production activities also are subject to all of the physical risks and uncertainties normally associated with such activities  including  but not limited to  such hazards as explosions  fires  blowouts  leaks and spills  some of which may be very difficult and expensive to control and or remediate  and damages from hurricanes  typhoons  monsoons and other severe weather conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and potential resources is inherently uncertain and involves subjective geological  engineering and economic judgments 
changes in operating conditions  such as unforeseen geological complexities and drilling and production difficulties  and changes in economic conditions  such as finding and development and production costs and sales prices  could cause material downward revisions in the company s estimated proved reserves and potential resources 
projections of future amounts of crude oil and natural gas production are also imprecise because they rely on assumptions about the future levels of prices and costs  field decline rates  market demand and supply  the political  economic and regulatory climates and  in the case of the company s foreign production  the terms of the contracts under which the company operates  which could result in mandated production cutbacks from existing or projected levels 
a significant portion of the company s expectation for future oil and gas development involves large projects  primarily offshore in increasingly deeper waters 
the timing and amounts of production from such projects will be dependent upon  among other things  the formulation of development plans and their approval by foreign governmental authorities and other working interest partners  the receipt of necessary permits and other approvals from governmental agencies  the obtaining of adequate financing  either internally or externally  the availability  costs and performance of drilling rigs and other equipment  and the timely construction of platforms  pipelines and other necessary infrastructure by specialized contractors 
certain political and economic risks the company s operations outside of the us are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations  including  without limitation  the loss of revenues  property and equipment from hazards such as expropriation  nationalization  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties or other takes  abrogation or renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency conversion and repatriation restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations  and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
laws and policies of the us government affecting foreign trade and taxation may also adversely affect the company s international operations 
the company s ability to market crude oil  natural gas and other commodities produced in foreign countries  and the prices the company will be able to obtain for such production  will depend on many factors which are often beyond the company s control  such as the existence or development of markets for its discoveries  the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities or the timely construction thereof  fluctuating demand for oil and natural gas  the availability and costs of competing fuels  and the effects of foreign governmental regulation of production and sales 
the company s operations in the us are also subject to political  regulatory and economic conditions 
in light of the foregoing  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect management s views only as of the date they are published or presented 
although the company from time to time may voluntarily revise its forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances  it undertakes no obligation to do so 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
as part of its overall risk management strategies  the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage and reduce risks associated with these factors 
the company also pursues outright pricing positions in certain hydrocarbon derivative instruments  such as futures contracts  swaps and options 
the company determines the fair values of its derivative financial instruments primarily based upon market quotes of exchange traded instruments 
most futures and options contracts are valued based upon direct exchange quotes or industry published price indicies 
some instruments with longer maturity periods require financial modeling to accommodate calculations beyond the horizon of available exchange quotes 
these models calculate values for outer periods using current exchange quotes forward curve and assumptions regarding interest rates  commodity and interest rate volatility and  in some cases  foreign currency exchange rates in the outer periods 
while the company feels that its use of current exchange quotes and assumptions regarding interest rates and volatilities are appropriate factors used to measure the fair value of its longer termed hydrocarbon derivative instruments  other pricing assumptions or methodologies may lead to materially different results in some instances 
interest rate risk from time to time the company temporarily invests its excess cash in interest bearing securities issued by high quality issuers 
company policies limit the amount of investment in securities of any one financial institution 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to the company 
the company s primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to the company s long term debt obligations 
the company manages its exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate risk sensitive derivative financial instruments  such as swaps or options may also be used depending upon market conditions 
the company evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on the fair value of its interest rate risk sensitive financial instruments at december  assuming a ten percent decrease in the company s weighted average borrowing costs at december  and december   respectively  the potential increase in the fair value of the company s debt obligations and associated interest rate derivative instruments  including the company s net interests in the debt obligations and associated interest rate derivative instruments of its subsidiaries  would have been approximately million at december  and million at december  foreign exchange rate risk the company conducts business in various parts of the world and in various foreign currencies 
to limit the company s foreign currency exchange rate risk related to operating income  foreign sales agreements generally contain price provisions designed to insulate the company s sales revenues against adverse foreign currency exchange rates 
in most countries  energy products are valued and sold in us dollars and foreign currency operating cost exposures have not been significant 
in other countries  the company is paid for product deliveries in local currencies but at prices indexed to the us dollar 
these funds  less amounts retained for operating costs  are converted to us dollars as soon as practicable 
the company s canadian subsidiaries are paid in canadian dollars for their crude oil and natural gas sales 
from time to time the company may purchase foreign currency options or enter into foreign currency swap or foreign currency forward contracts to limit the exposure related to its foreign currency debt or other obligations 
at december   the company had various foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge its debt and other local currency obligations in canada  thailand and the netherlands 
the company evaluated the effect that near term changes in foreign exchange rates would have had on the fair value of the company s combined foreign currency position related to its outstanding foreign currency swaps and forward contracts 
assuming an adverse change of ten percent in foreign exchange rates at december   the potential decrease in fair value of the company s foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency denominated debt  foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts of its subsidiaries  would have been approximately million at december  at year end  the company had various foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge some of its debt and other local currency obligations in canada  thailand and the netherlands 
assuming an adverse change of ten percent in foreign exchange rates at year end  the potential decrease in fair value of the company s foreign currency forward contracts  including the company s net interests in the foreign currency denominated debt  foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts of its subsidiaries  would have been approximately million at december  commodity price risk the company is a producer  purchaser  marketer and trader of certain hydrocarbon commodities such as crude oil and condensate  natural gas and refined products and is subject to the associated price risks 
the company uses hydrocarbon price sensitive derivative instruments hydrocarbon derivatives  such as futures contracts  swaps  collars and options to mitigate its overall exposure to fluctuations in hydrocarbon commodity prices 
the company may also enter into hydrocarbon derivatives to hedge contractual delivery commitments and future crude oil and natural gas production against price exposure 
the company also actively trades hydrocarbon derivatives  primarily exchange regulated futures and options contracts  subject to internal policy limitations 
the company uses a variance covariance value at risk model to assess the market risk of its hydrocarbon derivatives 
value at risk represents the potential loss in fair value the company would experience on its hydrocarbon derivatives  using calculated volatilities and correlations over a specified time period with a given confidence level 
the company s risk model is based upon historical data and uses a three day time interval with a percent confidence level 
the model includes offsetting physical positions for hydrocarbon derivatives related to the company s fixed price pre paid crude oil and pre paid natural gas sales 
the model also includes the company s net interests in its subsidiaries crude oil and natural gas hydrocarbon derivatives and forward sales contracts 
based upon the company s risk model  the value at risk related to hydrocarbon derivatives held for purposes other than hedging was approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  the value at risk related to hydrocarbon derivatives held for non hedging purposes was approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  in order to provide a more comprehensive view of the company s commodity price risk  a tabular presentation of open hydrocarbon derivatives is also provided 
the following table sets forth the future volumes and price ranges of hydrocarbon derivatives held by the company at december   along with the fair values of those instruments
