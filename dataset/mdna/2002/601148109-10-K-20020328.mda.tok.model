critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to real estate and development assets  revenue recognition in conjunction with providing development  leasing and management services and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
a summary of the company s accounting policies and procedures are included in footnote of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
management believes the following critical accounting policies among others affect its more significant judgment of estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
real estate and development assets costs related to the acquisition  predevelopment  development  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized 
interest  real estate taxes  insurance and other development related costs including certain direct and indirect costs incurred during the construction period are also capitalized 
upon completion of development all such costs are depreciated over the life of the related assets 
costs incurred during predevelopment are capitalized after management has identified and secured a site  determined that a project is feasible  and concluded that it is probable that the project will proceed 
the operating partnership has invested significant amounts of capital in several predevelopment projects 
while management believes it will recover this capital through the successful development of such projects  or through other alternative opportunities and courses of action in the event that such development cannot proceed  it is possible that a significant write off of unrecoverable amounts could occur 
a material write off could impact the financial condition of the operating partnership  including its ability to comply with certain covenant tests under various debt agreements of the company 
a material write off could also impact the company s ability to obtain funding for future development projects 
income producing properties are individually evaluated for impairment when various conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from a property are less than its historical net cost basis 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  the company records an impairment charge equal to the excess of historical cost basis over fair value 
revenue recognition the company  as lessor  has retained substantially all the risks and benefits of property ownership and accounts for its leases as operating leases 
minimum rent from income producing properties is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
percentage rent is recognized when tenants sales have reached certain levels specified in the respective leases 
recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
msc has entered into agreements with the joint ventures to provide management  leasing  development and financial services for the joint venture properties 
for management services  msc is entitled to a percentage of rental revenues received by the joint venture property 
for leasing services  msc is entitled to an agreed upon rate monthly per square foot of space leased that is recognized upon execution of a lease 
for development services  msc is entitled to an agreed upon fee that is deferred during the predevelopment stage of the project and subsequently recognized ratably during the development period once a development agreement is executed 
for financial services  msc receives an agreed upon percentage of the total loan commitment which is recognized when a construction loan or permanent loan is executed by the lender 
costs incurred to provide leasing  development and financial services are capitalized when incurred and subsequently expensed as the fee is earned 
other fee income from affiliated joint ventures reflects the fees earned from providing leasing  development and financing services  net of the estimated costs incurred to provide these services 
investment in unconsolidated joint ventures the company does not consider itself to be in control of joint ventures when major business decisions require the approval of at least one other general partner 
accordingly  the company accounts for its joint ventures under the equity method 
the company calculates the equity in income or loss earned from its unconsolidated joint ventures based on its estimate of each partner s economic ownership which is estimated based on anticipated stabilized cashflows as they would be allocated to each partner based on how cash flow is distributed 
generally  under the terms of the respective partnership agreements  net ordinary cashflow is distributed to each partner first to pay preferences on unreturned capital balances including cumulative unpaid preferences and thereafter in accordance with residual sharing percentages as defined in the partnership agreement 
cashflow from capital events including refinancing and asset sales is allocated first to partners in an amount equal to their unreturned capital account and thereafter in accordance with residual sharing percentages

portfolio data seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales peaking in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season 
as a result  a substantial portion of the percentage rents is not paid until the fourth quarter 
furthermore  most new lease up occurs towards the latter part of the year in anticipation of the holiday season and most vacancies occur toward the beginning of the year 
in addition  the majority of the temporary tenants take occupancy in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  cash flow and occupancy levels are generally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 
this seasonality also impacts the quarter by quarter results of net operating income and ffo 
economic trends because inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years  it has had little impact on our operations during that period 
even in periods of higher inflation  however  tenant leases provide  in part  a mechanism to help protect our operations 
as operating costs increase  our leases permit a pass through of the common area maintenance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes and insurance  to our tenants 
furthermore  most of the leases contain base rent steps and percentage rent clauses that provide additional rent after a certain minimum sales level is achieved 
these provisions provide us with some protection during highly inflationary periods 
the september th events have resulted in an increase in insurance and security costs which is anticipated to be absorbed by the company s tenants with only a modest impact on common area maintenance costs at each property 
insurance providers have reduced coverage for terrorist attacks from full coverage to a million per incident maximum  which reduction could impact the loan underwriting process for the company s future construction loans and the refinancing of the company s existing debt 
there is a possibility that the federal government may provide assistance to companies that can no longer obtain full coverage insurance for terrorist attacks 
the company has not yet assessed what the impact of a reduction of such coverage will be on the company as a whole

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments derivatives and hedging in the normal course of business  we and our joint ventures are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
we and the joint ventures limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures  including the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risk 
we and the joint ventures do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
we and the joint ventures require that the hedging derivative instruments are effective in reducing interest rate risk exposure 
this effectiveness is essential for qualifying for hedge accounting 
changes in the hedging instrument s fair value related to the effective portion of the risk being hedged are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in those cases  hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs 
hedges that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as cash flow hedges at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is marked to market with the change included in net income in each period until the derivative instrument matures

in the unlikely event that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of an interest rate swap contract or collar agreement  our exposure is limited to the interest rate differential on the notional amount 
we do not anticipate non performance by any of its counterparties 
net interest differentials to be paid or received under a swap contract and or collar agreement are included in interest expense as incurred or earned 
interest rate hedges  that are designated as cash flow hedges  hedge the future cash outflows on debt 
interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments  interest rate caps  floors  collars and forwards are cash flow hedges 
the unrealized gains losses in the fair value of these hedges are reported on the balance sheet and included in accounts payable and other liabilities or in investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for joint venture hedges with a corresponding adjustment to either accumulated other comprehensive income loss or in earnings depending on the hedging relationship 
if the hedging transaction is a cash flow hedge  then the offsetting gains losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
over time  the unrealized gains losses held in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be recognized in earnings consistent with when the hedged items are recognized in earnings 
within the next twelve months  the company expects to reclassify million to earnings as interest expense and the joint ventures expect to reclassify to earnings as interest expense approximately million from the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive loss  of which the company s pro rata share is million
