item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview huttig is one of the largest domestic distributors of building materials used principally in new residential construction and in home improvement  remodeling and repair work 
we distribute our products through distribution centers serving states 
our wholesale distribution centers  which sell principally to building materials dealers and home centers  who  in turn  supply the end user  are organized into northeast  mid atlantic  southeast  midwest  northwest  southwest and industrial regions 
our builder resource locations sell directly to professional builders and large contractors 
our american pine products manufacturing facility in prineville  oregon  produces softwood mouldings 
approximately of american pine s sales were to huttig s distribution centers during fiscal during  we completed the integration of rugby usa  inc  the parent of rugby building products  inc  a residential building materials distributor  which we acquired in december in  we turned our focus to expanding our product line and improving our operating efficiencies 
the implementation of our company wide  single platform information system in has allowed us to centralize our accounting and procurement functions and improve the quality and consistency of management reporting and business analysis 
we believe our new information system also will allow us to leverage our size and serve as a standard foundation for new applications that can be implemented cost effectively on a company wide basis in the future 
during  we intend to continue to o expand our product lines and add higher margin products  o focus on providing efficient  high quality customer service through the deployment of information technology and implementation of industry best practices  o simplify our business processes to make it easier for our customers and vendors to do business with us  o leverage our size to negotiate better pricing  delivery and service terms with our suppliers  o achieve operating efficiencies by consolidating administrative systems across the company  and o pursue opportunities to expand our product lines  service and delivery capabilities and geographic reach through acquisitions 
various factors historically have caused our operations to fluctuate from period to period 
these factors include levels of construction  home improvement and remodeling activity  weather  prices of commodity wood products  interest rates  availability of credit and other local  regional and economic conditions 
all of these factors are cyclical or seasonal in nature 
we anticipate that page of fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
our first quarter and  occasionally  our fourth quarter are adversely affected by winter weather patterns in the midwest and northeast  which result in seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas 
we believe we have the product offerings  warehouse and builder support facilities  personnel  systems infrastructure and financial and competitive resources necessary for continued business success 
our future revenues  costs and profitability  however  are all influenced by a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under cautionary statement below 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management bases these estimates and assumptions on historical results and known trends as well as our forecasts as to how these might change in the future 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
approximately and of inventories were determined by using the lifo last in  first out method of inventory valuation as of december  and  respectively  the remainder were determined by the fifo first in  first out method 
during  and  lifo inventory quantities were reduced  resulting in a partial liquidation of the lifo bases  the effect of which increased net income by million  million and million  respectively 
an additional allowance for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded based on our review of quantities on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
insurance we carry insurance policies on insurable risks that we believe are appropriate 
we generally have self insured retention limits and have obtained fully insured layers of coverage above such self insured retention limits 
accruals for self insurance losses are made based on our claims experience 
we have certain liabilities with respect to existing or unreported claims  and accrue for these liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased from  million in to million in excluding sales attributable to branches which were closed or consolidated  same branch net sales decreased from the prior year 
the decrease in net sales was partially attributable to discontinuing the distribution of andersen r windows  which accounted for million of net sales during the year ended december  industrial product net sales were million less in versus deflation in the commodity wood market is estimated to have reduced net sales by million in the current year 
other factors contributing to the decrease in net sales included adverse weather conditions as compared to  primarily in the first quarter of and the general downturn in the economy compared to the decrease in total net sales also reflects the closing of five branches during the year  three of which sold andersen r products 
non andersen r related net sales at these closed branches were million lower in than gross profit decreased million to million in from million in and as a percentage of sales was in versus in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from improved product mix 
net door sales increased from to of our total net sales while windows declined from to of total net sales during the year 
in  door sales generated a margin compared to a window sales margin of 
gross profit in both and  was negatively impacted by million of restructuring charges for inventory losses which were recorded as an increase to costs of sales 
operating expenses were million in compared to million in  a decrease 
the decrease is partially attributable to lower sales volume  causing a decrease in selling and delivery expense of million 
general and administrative costs were million lower primarily due to lower compensation expense resulting from a reduction in headcount and lower bonus expense 
these decreases were offset by increased warehouse rent and supply costs at our facilities of approximately million and increased provision for bad debt of million 
also included in operating expenses in were million of costs related to the implementation of our single platform information system and million related to our on going environmental remediation work 
included in operating expenses in were million of non recurring costs related to the restructuring of our operations and various integration costs associated with the rugby acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the closure of certain historically under performing branches  of which million was recorded in cost of sales 
the charge was primarily for severance  inventory page of writedowns  vacant facilities and other shutdown related costs 
we expect the closures to be substantially completed during the first half of gains on disposal of assets were million in compared to million in the gains in both years resulted primarily from the disposal of duplicate capital assets in conjunction with our restructuring and branch consolidation efforts 
net interest expense decreased by million to million in from million in our average outstanding debt decreased by million compared to the prior year  resulting in a decrease in interest expense that was partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate 
the higher rates are attributable to the interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during the second quarter of which effectively provide for a fixed rate of interest 
a total unrealized loss on derivatives of million was recorded after operating profit in this includes million that was amortized from other comprehensive income oci and million related to the change in fair value on two interest rate swaps that do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes 
the interest rate swap that is designated as a cash flow hedge was determined to be highly effective and substantially all of the change in the fair value was charged to oci 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased from million in to  million in although the acquisition of rugby contributed million to total net sales in  this increase was offset by a decrease in same branch net sales of or million 
contributing to the decrease in same branch net sales was deterioration in commodity wood prices which is believed to have negatively impacted net sales by million versus additionally  we stopped distributing andersen r products in october in  total net sales of andersen r products was million compared to million in gross profit grew to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from the rugby acquisition and was offset by a decrease in same branch results of or million and the deterioration in commodity wood prices which is believed to have negatively impacted gross profit by million 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was in versus in gross profit in was also negatively impacted by million of restructuring charges for inventory losses which was recorded as an increase to cost of sales 
operating expenses increased by million from million in to million in this increase included approximately million attributable to the acquisition of rugby and was offset by a decrease in same branch expenses of million 
operating expenses in include million of costs incurred as a result of the restructuring activities described below 
operating expenses in include a million gain from the curtailment of a post retirement health benefit plan which was partially offset by million of other one time costs 
non recurring charges  which are included in cost of sales  operating expenses and restructuring charges on the income statement totaled million in this includes million of restructuring charges related to the termination of our distribution agreement with andersen r and a strategic plan to consolidate and integrate various branch and support operations of which million was recorded in cost of sales 
the charge was primarily for severance  inventory losses and facility and other shutdown related costs 
we also incurred million of costs that were not chargeable against reserves and are included in operating expenses 
gains on disposal of assets were million in compared to a loss on disposal in of million 
the gains in resulted primarily from the disposal of duplicate capital assets in conjunction with our restructuring and branch consolidation efforts 
interest expense increased million primarily as a result of higher average debt outstanding and other expenses declined million 
in  we refinanced our revolving credit facility with chase manhattan bank 
in conjunction with the refinancing of the previously existing facility  we recorded an extraordinary expense of million million net of tax for the write off of unamortized loan fees 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our secured credit facility to finance seasonal working capital needs  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our working capital requirements are generally greatest in the second and third quarters  page of which reflects the seasonal nature of our business 
the second and third quarters are also typically our strongest operating quarters  largely due to more favorable weather throughout many of our markets compared to the first and fourth quarters 
we measure our working capital as the sum of net trade accounts receivable  net fifo inventories and trade accounts payable 
at december  and  our working capital was as follows trade accounts receivable  net fifo inventories  net trade accounts payable working captial  net working capital as a of annualized quarterly sales inventory turns for the year ended december   cash and equivalents increased by million due principally to cash generated from operating activities 
changes in operating assets and liabilities provided million in cash from operating activities due to decreases in trade accounts receivable and inventories and increases in trade accounts payable 
in  more cash was provided by decreases in trade accounts receivable and inventories and more cash was used by decreases in accrued liabilities than in due to the liquidation of accounts receivable  inventories and accrued liabilities acquired in december from rugby 
cash used in investing activities reflects million of capital expenditures and million relating to our purchase of assets from monarch manufacturing  inc in baltimore  maryland and hope lumber and supply corporation in kansas city  missouri 
these expenditures were offset  in part  by million of proceeds on disposals of assets  as part of our restructuring and branch consolidation efforts 
in  disposals of assets during these branch consolidation efforts generated million which provided cash for capital expenditures of million 
cash used in financing activities in each of the last two years have been driven by payments of debt 
in  bank debt decreased million and million of treasury stock was repurchased 
we have a million secured revolving credit facility with chase manhattan bank as agent 
at december   we had three interest rate swap agreements having a total notional amount of million 
these swap agreements  in combination with the revolving credit agreement  effectively provide for a fixed weighted average rate of on up to million of our outstanding revolving credit borrowings 
the interest rate on the remainder of the committed outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement is a floating rate equal to libor plus basis points  at december  when actual borrowings are less than the total notional amount of the swaps  we incur an expense equal to the difference between million and the actual amount borrowed  times the difference between the fixed rate on the interest rate swap agreement and the day libor rate 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
as of february   we had letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility totaling million 
as of february   we had approximately million of unused credit available under our revolving credit facility 
provisions of the secured revolving credit facility contain various covenants which  among other things  limit our ability to incur indebtedness  incur liens  declare or pay dividends or make restricted payments  consolidate  merge or sell assets and require us to attain certain financial ratios in regards to leverage net debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  consolidated net worth  and interest expense coverage consolidated ebitda less capital expenditures to consolidated cash interest expense 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds available under our credit facility will provide sufficient funds to meet our currently anticipated short term and long term liquidity and capital expenditure requirements 
page of stock repurchase authorization in august  our board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million 
of these shares  we purchased  shares from the rugby group limited  our largest shareholder  for a cash purchase price of million  or a per share price of  the closing price on the new york stock exchange of our common stock on the date of our agreement with rugby 
as part of our repurchase agreement with rugby  our repurchase of these shares did not affect rugby s existing right to nominate up to three members of our board of directors under our registration rights agreement with rugby entered into as part of our acquisition of rugby building products 
we hold repurchased shares as treasury stock and make them available for use in connection with employee benefit plans and other general corporate purposes 
at december   we had million remaining under the stock repurchase authorization 
restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the termination of our distribution agreement with andersen r and our adoption of a strategic plan to consolidate and integrate various branch and support operations of which million was included in cost of sales 
the charge was primarily for severance  inventory losses and facility and other shutdown related costs 
we charged approximately million against this reserve during the fourth quarter of  leaving a balance of million at december  we fully utilized the remaining balance during during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the closure of several historically under performing branches  of which million was recorded in cost of sales for the writedown of inventory to realizable value 
other components of the charge were million for severance related costs and million for facility and other shutdown related costs 
severance costs relate to approximately employees primarily at distribution center locations 
included in amounts charged against this restructuring reserve in was million for inventory losses and million for facility shutdown costs 
we expect the closures to be substantially completed during the first half of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning after december  under the provisions of this statement  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
alternatively  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill existing as of january  will be subject to a transitional assessment of any impairment issues during goodwill amortization for the years ended december  and was million per year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement  as it relates to the transitional and annual assessments for impairment of recorded goodwill on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  which is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations 
we believe the adoption of statement no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
cautionary statement this annual report on form k and our annual report to shareholders contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements present management s expectations  beliefs  plans and objectives regarding our future business and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are based on current projections  estimates  assumptions and judgments  and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the strength of the national and local new residential construction and home improvement and remodeling markets  which in turn depend on factors such as interest rates  employment levels  availability of credit  prices of commodity wood products  consumer confidence  adverse weather conditions  the level of competition in our industry  our relationships with suppliers of the products we distribute and our exposure to costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations 
additional information concerning these and other factors is included below 
we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward looking statements 
page of our sales and profitability depend significantly on new residential construction and home improvement activity  which is highly cyclical and seasonal 
our sales depend heavily on the strength of national and local new residential construction and home improvement and remodeling markets 
the strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and residential renovation projects  which are a function of many factors beyond our control 
some of these factors include interest rates  employment levels  availability of credit  prices of commodity wood products and consumer confidence 
future downturns in the markets that we serve or in the economy generally could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
reduced levels of construction activity may result in intense price competition among building materials suppliers  which may adversely affect our gross margins 
our first quarter revenues and  to a lesser extent  our fourth quarter revenues are typically adversely affected by winter construction cycles and weather patterns in colder climates as the level of activity in the new construction and home improvement markets decreases 
because much of our overhead and expense remains relatively fixed throughout the year  our profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters 
the building materials distribution industry is extremely competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully with some of our existing competitors or new entrants in the markets we serve 
the building materials distribution industry is extremely competitive 
our competition varies by product line  customer classification and geographic market 
the principal competitive factors in our industry are o availability of product  o service and delivery capabilities  o ability to assist with problem solving  o customer relationships  and o breadth of product offerings 
also  financial stability and geographic coverage are important to manufacturers in choosing distributors for their products 
we compete with many local  regional and  in some markets and product categories  national building materials distributors and dealers 
we also compete with major integrated product manufacturers with national distribution capability  such as georgia pacific  weyerhauser and boise cascade 
to a limited extent in some of our markets  we compete with the large home center chains like the home depot and lowe s for the business of smaller contractors 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources and may be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we can 
we can give no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors 
the termination of key supplier relationships may have an immediate adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we distribute building materials that we purchase from a number of major suppliers 
as is customary in our industry  most of our contracts with these suppliers are terminable without cause on short notice 
in october  andersen r windows terminated our distribution agreement  at which time we stopped distributing andersen r windows and were forced to find alternative window suppliers 
andersen r windows sales accounted for million and million in and  respectively 
as a result of the termination of the distribution agreement  sales of windows represented of our total sales in  compared with and in and  respectively 
although we believe that relationships with our existing suppliers are strong and that we would have access to similar products from competing suppliers  any disruption in our sources of supply  particularly of our most commonly sold items  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we also can give no assurance that any supply shortages resulting from unanticipated demand or production difficulties will not occur from time to time or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuation in prices of commodity wood products that we buy and then resell may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
parts of our business  such as the softwood moulding manufacturing operation and our distribution centers that sell directly to home builders and large contractors  directly face the risk of periodic fluctuations in the prices of wood commodities 
changes in wood page of commodity prices between the time we buy these products and the time we resell them have occurred in the past and we expect fluctuations to occur again in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage these fluctuations effectively or minimize any impact of these changes on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks of incurring significant costs to comply with environmental regulations 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental protection laws and regulations 
we can give no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the clean up of contamination at a formerly owned property in montana 
we are voluntarily remediating this property under the oversight of the montana department of environmental quality deq 
when the state agency issues its final risk assessment of this property  we will conduct a feasibility study to evaluate alternatives for cleanup  including continuation of our remediation measures already in place 
the deq then will select a final remedy  publish a record of decision and negotiate with us for an administrative order of consent on the implementation of the final remedy 
we currently believe that this process may take several more years to complete and intend to continue monitoring and remediating the site  evaluating cleanup alternatives and reporting regularly to the deq during this interim period 
based on our experience to date in remediating this site  we do not believe that the scope of remediation that the deq ultimately determines will have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
until the deq selects a final remedy  however  we can give no assurance as to the scope or cost to us of the final remediation order 
in addition  some of our current and former distribution centers are located in areas of current or former industrial activity where environmental contamination may have occurred  and for which we  among others  could be held responsible 
we currently believe  but can give no assurance  that there are no material environmental liabilities at any of our distribution center locations 
we face the risks that product liability claims and other legal proceedings relating to the products we distribute may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as is the case with other companies in our industry  we face the risk of product liability and other claims in the event that the use of products that we have distributed results in personal injury or other damages 
for example  we are currently defending lawsuits involving plaintiffs who allege that they have suffered personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos containing products 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
product liability claims in the future  regardless of their ultimate outcome and whether or not they are covered under our insurance policies or may be indemnified by our suppliers  could result in costly litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our future growth will depend on our ability to identify acquisition opportunities  integrate acquired businesses and realize the value we expected at the time of their acquisition 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to pursue additional acquisitions of comparable businesses to expand our product offerings and geographic coverage and for other strategic reasons 
we may not be successful in finding desirable acquisition candidates or acquiring businesses that we do identify 
depending upon the size of a particular transaction or the magnitude of all of our acquisition activity  future acquisitions could require additional equity capital  further borrowings and the consent of our lenders 
there can be no assurances that our lenders will consent to any capital raising or acquisition transactions 
if we are not correct when we assess the value  strengths  weaknesses  liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates or if we are not successful in integrating the operations of the acquired businesses  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
our failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk huttig has exposure to market risk as it relates to the effects of changes in interest rates 
we had bank debt outstanding at december  and  under our revolving credit agreement of million and million  respectively 
also at december   we had three interest rate swap agreements having a total notional principal amount of million 
these swap agreements in page of combination with the terms of our revolving credit agreement  effectively provide for a fixed weighted average rate of on up to million of our outstanding borrowings 
the interest rate on the committed outstanding borrowings in excess of million under the revolving credit agreement is a floating rate equal to libor plus basis points  at december  when actual borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are less than the notional amount of the interest rate swaps  we incur an expense equal to the difference between million and the actual amount borrowed  times the difference between the fixed rate on the interest rate swap agreement and the day libor rate 
included in the financial results is the impact of adopting sfas no 
 which established accounting and reporting standards for derivative and hedging activities 
we have three interest rate swap agreements that provide for fixed interest rates on million of our outstanding borrowings 
under the accounting treatment prescribed by sfas no 
 our liabilities include the fair value of these swaps of million and shareholders equity includes million  net of tax  which is recorded as other comprehensive income 
fair value is determined by using discounted cash flows based on estimated forward day libor rates through the date of maturity  may  on the swaps 
included in expense  after profit from operations  is million of an unrealized loss related to the portion of our swap agreements  which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment according to the sfas no 
criteria 
this unrealized loss resulted in a decrease to net income per share of in there is no impact on cash flow as a result of the accounting treatment required by sfas no 
effective january   we entered into a price swap agreement to purchase specified levels of heating oil on a monthly basis at a fixed price  in an effort to hedge the cost of our diesel fuel consumption for our delivery fleet 
as heating oil rate changes effectively correlate to diesel fuel rate changes  we intend to account for this agreement as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
this swap agreement is intended to hedge approximately of our estimated consumption of diesel fuel or approximately million gallons 
as a result of the agreement  we are subject to commodity price risk for changes in the price of diesel fuel because we have locked in a fixed rate of per gallon of heating oil 
we are subject to periodic fluctuations in the price of wood commodities 
profitability is influenced by these changes as prices change between the time we buy and sell the wood 
in addition  to the extent changes in interest rates affect the housing and remodeling market  we would be affected by such changes
