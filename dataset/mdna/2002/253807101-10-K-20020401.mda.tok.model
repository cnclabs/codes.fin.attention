item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of digimarc  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks related to our business and risks related to our industry and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we assume no obligation to update this information 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
overview digimarc is a leading provider of digital watermarking technologies that allow imperceptible digital code to be embedded in the printed or digital versions of media content  such as commercial and consumer photographs  movies  music  magazine advertisements  catalogs  product packages and valuable documents like identification cards  financial instruments  passports and event tickets 
in addition to a code that can be embedded within various types of media content  our technologies include reader software that  as a resident application on pcs and other devices  enables the recognition of these embedded codes 
we believe our technologies have many potential applications 
we are developing products and services to address what we currently believe are our three largest near term market opportunities the deterrence of digital counterfeiting and piracy  the enhancement of internet access and navigation  and the enhancement and protection of audio and video digital files 
on december   we consummated  through our wholly owned subsidiary  digimarc id systems  llc and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries  the purchase of certain assets used primarily in the united states government identification systems business and foreign government digital identification systems business of polaroid corporation  polaroid id systems  inc and certain other affiliated entities of polaroid corporation collectively known as large government program identification business a division of polaroid corporation  or lgp 
as part of the transaction  we also assumed certain liabilities of lgp 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
digimarc s consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of lgp from the date of acquisition on december  through december  with this acquisition  we became a leading provider of identification card systems to government agencies  which include drivers licenses  voter identification cards and other similar programs 
we intend to increase our revenue through increasing adoption of our products and services  marketing new digital watermarking applications  and licensing our intellectual property 
we expect to target  among other sources of revenue  government agencies  commercial printers  packaging companies  publishers  advertisers  proprietors of large image collections  and other producers of printed materials 
our aim is to license our technologies to those content producers so that they may embed our digital watermarks in their print media  such as identification documents  magazine advertisements and articles  direct mail coupons  catalogs  stationery and envelopes  product packaging  labels and tags  trading cards  credit cards  and business cards 
our current and anticipated products are intended to enable content producers to control reproduction and alteration of their content  as well as to enable their print materials to provide a link to relevant web destinations 
revenue from our new applications may include one time license fees  time based or volume based fees  subscription fees  royalties and revenue sharing arrangements 
we anticipate that the calculation of fees and royalties will be based at least in part on the size of the installed base of personal computers  cameras  scanners  digital image capture and output devices  and software carrying our patented reader technology as well as the nature of the use  and the nature and amount of licensed content carrying our digital watermarks 
since inception  we have invested a significant portion of our resources and capital in attracting top senior management  in developing our products and technology and in building our sales and marketing organizations 
we have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our business and prospects 
we have incurred significant losses to date  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we intend to continue to expend significant financial and management resources on developing additional products and services  improving sales and marketing activities  advancing our technologies and expanding our operations 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur additional losses and negative cash flow through most of  if not all of and possibly beyond 
our revenue may not increase or even continue at its current levels and we may not achieve or maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies deploying new technologies and applications  such as our efforts to include digital watermarking in the personal identification systems business and develop our digimarc mediabridge system as a new means of using the internet 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires digimarc to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  long term service contracts  warranties  investments  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition on long term service contracts  impairments and estimation of useful lives of long term assets  inventory valuation  and accruals for loss contracts and contingencies 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs  and using a price per card method 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through corporate policy  and approval and monitoring processes 
our estimates of revenue and expenses on customer contracts change periodically in the normal course of business  occasionally due to modifications of our contractual arrangements 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we reduce the value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies
