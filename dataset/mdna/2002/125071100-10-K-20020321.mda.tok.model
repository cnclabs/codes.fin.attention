the company intends to achieve this cost reduction through the streamlining of its information technology and financial systems and its operations management and support structures 
in conjunction with the plan  the company recorded a provision for restructure in the fourth quarter of related to the following asset impairments million provision for severance million provision for termination of operating leases million million the breakdown of the restructuring charge among operating segments was as follows information technology services million technical services million management recruiters million todays staffing million corporate million million the plan calls for the decommissioning of the company s enterprise resource planning erp system during the first six months of and the transition to systems that are targeted to the specific businesses that they support and that can be maintained at a lower cost

over the six months ending june  the company will depreciate the remaining estimated fair value of the software of million along with million of associated computer hardware on which the software resides and which has no alternative use 
cdi will record depreciation of million per quarter in the first six months of related to the plan to decommission the system 
the remaining asset impairments of million relate to assets at closed units with no alternative use and goodwill 
the provision for severance relates to the involuntary termination of approximately employees 
management expects this program to be completed by september  this program was communicated to employees prior to year end  and relates to a fundamental reorganization of the company s lines of business and the management of those businesses 
the plan also calls for the exit of certain lower margin customer relationships and the reorganization of the remaining business into four operating segments professional services  project management  permanent placement and temporary staffing 
the permanent placement and temporary staffing segments are the same as cdi s existing management recruiters mri and todays staffing operating segments 
the company is creating the professional services segment by combining the higher margin elements of the technical services staffing business with the existing information technology services staffing business 
the segment will also include anderselite  cdi s united kingdom subsidiary 
the project management operating segment will comprise cdi s engineering  information technology and telecommunications project management businesses 
while the discussion herein relates to the segments the way the company was managed in  future reports will include segment information using the new management structure 
included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements is supplemental information about the company as if the new reporting structure had been in place for the provision for termination of operating leases relates to the company s decision to close offices and to consolidate certain locations providing support services to the operating businesses

the breakdown of these charges by operating segment is as follows information technology services million technical services million management recruiters million todays staffing million corporate million million results of operations  year ended december  vs 
year ended december  consolidated results the company recorded consolidated revenues of  million  down million from last year  as each operating segment reported lower revenues 
as noted above  the continuing economic slowdown in the united states adversely affected the staffing industry in  and was a primary contributing factor to the decline in revenues 
gross profit of million was down million compared to the gross profit margin was of revenues in compared to in  principally reflecting higher employee costs and a less favorable mix of business as the economy softened 
operating and administrative expenses  excluding the restructuring charge of million  were million  a decrease of million from the prior year 
operating and administrative costs include the million of event driven charges discussed above  an additional increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of million related principally to the increased frequency of bankruptcies among cdi s customers in and higher depreciation of million related principally to management information systems infrastructure 
operating and administrative costs fell in spite of these increases as cost savings initiatives which commenced in the second quarter had an increasing effect throughout the year 
interest expense of million fell million from the prior year  mostly reflecting reduced average borrowings during the year as well as lower interest rates 
the company s effective income tax rate was in compared to in the company s loss per share in was 
compared to earnings per diluted share of last year 
in the current year  basic and diluted shares are the same because including common stock equivalents would have been antidilutive 
acquisition activity in was not significant and therefore did not significantly affect results of operations 
similarly  for the year ended the company also incurred event driven charges as follows resolution of dispute with health insurance provider million billing adjustments million executive separation costs million other million million these charges are broken down by operating segment as follows information technology services million technical services million todays staffing million corporate million million during  the company reached a settlement with its health insurance provider related to rates and claims payments 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million 
the company also completed an extensive review of its customer accounts and related costs and following that review and reflecting management s assessment of the company s ultimate ability to recover these amounts  adjustments totaling million were charged to operations 
the company also recorded million of separation costs associated with changes in management personnel  including the company s former president and chief executive officer 
finally  in the company recorded other charges of million related to decisions made subsequent to the resignation of its former president and chief executive officer including the cancellation of consulting contracts  costs associated with acquisitions the company was no longer pursuing  the write off of a start up investment and costs associated with the decision to close two company offices 
segment discussion information technology services information technology services revenues of million were million lower than the previous year 
the segment had experienced higher revenues in the early part of the year as new business initiatives undertaken in the second half of took hold 
the slowing economy reversed this trend in the second half of however  the company s innovantage business  which supplies higher level information technology consulting and outsourcing services  experienced higher revenues in compared to the segment reported operating income of million  excluding the restructuring and event driven charges noted above million including such charges  compared to an operating profit of million last year excluding the charges in noted above million including such charges 
the reduced operating profit represents a lower direct margin on the unit s sales  mostly reflecting higher employee expenses and an unfavorable shift in the mix of business  partially offset by reduced operating and administrative expenses 
during and  one customer accounted for approximately of total segment revenues 
technical services the technical services operating segment had revenues of million  a reduction of million from throughout the year  the segment s quarterly revenues fell sequentially as well as compared to the comparable quarters of because of the slowing economy  which reduced demand in each of the segment s businesses staffing  engineering services and telecommunications from many of the segment s large  industrial customers 
additionally  the segment s revenues were adversely affected by the decision to exit lower margin customer relationships 
the unit experienced an operating loss of million in excluding the restructuring and event driven charges noted above million including such charges  compared to an operating profit of million in excluding the charges in noted above million including such charges 
the operating loss resulted principally from the lower revenues  which caused the unit to perform below its break even point  although higher employee benefits costs and a less favorable mix of business also caused a reduction in gross profit margin 
todays staffing todays todays revenues of million were million lower than  as the slowing economy particularly impacted todays administrative staffing business 
additionally  the unit experienced an unfavorable shift in mix of business to less profitable managed staffing arrangements 
todays had an operating profit of million  excluding restructuring and event driven charges million including such charges  compared to an operating profit of million  excluding the charges in noted above million including such charges 
lower operating and administrative costs were not sufficient to offset the reductions in revenues and gross profit 
management recruiters mri mri s revenues in of million fell million from the prior year  also reflecting the slowing economy and its impact on demand for permanent placement services 
revenues declined at both mri owned locations and in franchise revenue received from mri s franchised locations 
the segment had an operating profit of million  excluding restructuring and event driven charges million including such charges  compared to an operating profit of million last year 
the reduction in revenues was the primary reason for lower operating profit in corporate corporate expenses in totaled million excluding restructuring and event driven charges million including such charges  compared to million last year  excluding the charges noted above million including such charges 
the reduction in corporate expenses resulted from reduced corporate sponsored spending on information technology infrastructure and tighter cost controls 
corporate expenses include costs of million in related to its investment in a start up company that is intended to provide internet based third party administration of staffing and human resources requirements 
results of operations  year ended december  vs 
year ended december  consolidated results the company achieved revenues of  million in  an increase of million over all operating segments achieved year over year growth in revenues 
gross profit of million increased million over the prior year 
the gross profit margin improved to in from in the improvement in margin reflected the company s increased emphasis on contract pricing and improved operating results at mri 
operating and administrative costs of million rose million compared to during  the company invested in additional recruiters  management and infrastructure as well as new business initiatives 
in addition  recruiter compensation and bonus structures were changed to promote retention and increase productivity in light of very challenging labor supply and competitive pressures 
the company also incurred additional system costs to support its front and back office systems 
the operating profit of million fell million to million in as noted above  the company was faced with very challenging recruiting and employee market conditions in  along with the additional charges of million discussed above  both of which served to increase costs 
interest expense of million more than doubled from million in  primarily as a result of higher average borrowings during the year 
the company s income tax rate was in compared to in  primarily as a result of state tax minimization strategies 
earnings per share were per diluted share in  compared to per diluted share from continuing operations in there were no discontinued operations in acquisition activity in was not significant and did not have a significant effect on results of operations 
segment discussion information technology services information technology services operating segment revenues of million rose million compared to the segment experienced softer demand for its services in the early part of attributed by management to major customers hesitancy to launch new spending programs on the heels of spending required to maintain year readiness 
during the second half of  the segment experienced increased demand as customers initiated new systems projects  connected new systems to the internet  and developed formal outsourcing strategies in areas such as console operations and help desk support 
the segment s operating profit margin declined to from in in addition to the charges noted above  the segment invested in additional recruiters and enhanced its compensation programs in order to strengthen the unit s ability to attract and retain productive recruiters and compete in a very tight market for qualified technical talent 
the unit also incurred additional costs to implement a national staffing model and to launch its innovantage brand to signal its focus on professional services and functional outsourcing 
technical services technical services operating segment revenues of million rose million over this segment experienced solid increases in revenue  particularly during the first half of however  growth slowed during the second half of during the third quarter of  revenues declined from the second quarter due largely to the termination of a high margin multi year telecommunications contract 
there was a significant reduction in customer requirements following the customer s merger  which occurred on june  the contract was ultimately terminated in september additionally  in the fourth quarter  the segment experienced a sharp and broad based reduction in demand for services in its aerospace  electronics computer  chemical  telecommunications  automotive and marine services lines 
operating profit margins declined to from in in addition to the million charges discussed above  the segment made significant investments in management infrastructure and operations support  particularly in its telecommunications group 
the operating profit margin was also negatively impacted by the third quarter termination of the high margin telecommunications contract 
the segment was unable to immediately adjust its cost structure to compensate for the loss of the contract 
todays staffing todays todays revenues of million increased million over however  revenue growth began to decelerate after the first quarter of this slowdown was broad based and not geographic or industry specific 
the unit s slower revenue growth reflected the impact of an increasingly tighter labor market  making candidate recruiting more difficult and increasing turnover among the segment s recruiting and sales professionals  as a result of increased industry competition 
operating profit margins declined to in from in this slight decline was due  in part  to a decision to close two offices 
in addition  during the year  the segment experienced higher than normal turnover among its staff  including recruiting professionals  and implemented a series of recruiting and retention measures resulting in higher costs 
management recruiters mri mri s revenues of million rose million over mri experienced strong demand in all its geographic regions and growth in all key sales channels including company owned offices  franchised offices and its client services group  which services large block permanent placement assignments 
operating profit margin was in compared to in the improvement was attributable to continuing strong cost controls  strong performance by the segment s franchise organization and  in part  to a favorable recovery of a disputed contract 
inflation information technology services  technical services  and todays staffing segments services are priced generally in close relationship with direct labor costs 
mri s search services are priced as a function of salary levels of job candidates 
in  employee benefits costs  particularly health care costs  rose significantly due to the company s participation rates and claims experience and were not fully recovered through higher employee co pays or pricing adjustments 
the company is reviewing its options for reducing these costs and does not believe that they represent a general inflationary trend in its costs 
otherwise  inflation has not been a meaningful factor in the company s operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s main sources of liquidity are cash from operations and bank borrowings 
the company has an unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for borrowings up to million 
during  the company amended the credit agreement to reduce the aggregate commitment from million due to the reduced capital needs of the company currently 
the credit agreement expires march  an additional million unsecured line of credit was terminated  also reflecting the reduced capital needs of the company currently 
in addition  the company maintains an uncommitted short term line of credit with a bank for up to million 
borrowings are priced at floating rates of interest or at rates that are related to the lending banks cost of funds and  therefore  the company is subject to market risks as interest rates change see item a 
below 
these sources have been adequate to support growth opportunities in the company s businesses 
the credit agreement contains covenants related to certain financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  at december   the company had eliminated all bank borrowings and had approximately million of cash that was invested in short term instruments 
the company s remaining debt of approximately million all of which is classified as current principally represents notes which will mature in july the company s main asset is accounts receivable approximately and of total assets at december  and  respectively and  accordingly  expansions and contractions of the company s business operations can directly affect consolidated working capital  which in turn has a direct effect on total capital employed 
during  the company was able to eliminate its bank borrowings and accumulate cash because of the reduced level of operations and an improvement in the collection cycle of the company s receivables 
if the company were to significantly expand its operations or if it experienced a significant slowdown in collections of receivables  it could be necessary for the company to borrow funds under its available lines of credit in order to fund operations 
cash flows from operations were million in  an increase of million over  in spite of the company s net loss for the year 
the primary reason for this improvement was a reduction in receivables  reflecting the reduced level of business and the improvement in the company s collection cycle 
this improvement was partially offset by lower payables balances  also reflecting reduced levels of operations in cash used in investing activities was million in  a reduction of million from this lower investment resulted from reduced purchases of fixed assets principally investments in information technologies infrastructure  in the current year 
acquisition activity in was not significant 
payments for acquisitions in totaled million  approximately the same as  and principally represented payments relating to prior years acquisitions 
the company s total remaining potential liability for such contingent consideration is approximately million 
cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million used in financing activities in the increase principally represented repayments of the company s bank borrowings 
the company also began to reduce its borrowings in  as the company focused on working capital management 
the company believes that cash flows from operations as well as available borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements during accounting principles and new accounting standards significant accounting principles the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting principles from those available  to apply those principles consistently and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that affect revenues and associated costs as well as the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
because the staffing businesses in which the company operates are labor intensive  the timing and amounts of revenue recognized in the performance of the staffing services and the associated employee costs related to such revenue are particularly important 
the company s recognition of revenue and its estimate of the collectibility of those revenues require considerable judgment by management 
within cdi s staffing operations  revenue is generally recognized as services are provided 
within its project operations  the company must also determine if contractual commitments have been fulfilled or if fixed price contracts  if any  will result in a loss 
cdi attempts to minimize its exposure to these factors in its project operations by limiting the performance commitments it makes and by emphasizing cost plus arrangements with its customers 
the company s financial statements do not reflect any provision for future losses on fixed price contracts and management believes that revenue for its project operations has been appropriately recognized 
also  the company s customers generally consist of fortune businesses  so that  historically  customer creditworthiness had not been a major concern 
in the past two years  however  deteriorating economic conditions as well as mergers and acquisitions activity among the company s customers has increased cdi s credit risk 
mergers and acquisitions activity has increased cdi s credit risk either because customers have been spun off into smaller  more highly leveraged entities  or because cdi s business has become more concentrated within very large organizations 
cdi has increasingly emphasized its customer creditworthiness and receivables collections  but was still required to increase its provision for doubtful accounts to million in including the million event driven charges associated with exited customer relationships from million in the company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care insurance 
the amounts included in the company s costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions  the company s claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs

the company is currently in the process of evaluating sfas a study is required by sfas to be completed by june  and any potential impairment must be finally determined and recorded by december  at december   the company had goodwill of million and had goodwill amortization of million for the year then ended

as stated in note to the financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  the company consolidates all of its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries

a look forward as noted above  management of the company has been reorganized along four operating segments professional services  project management  permanent placement and temporary staffing 
management currently believes that revenues for its four operating segments will total approximately billion to billion in  depending largely on the strength of the united states economy 
the company expects to continue its process of pruning marginal or unprofitable customer relationships  particularly in the professional services segment and to redeploy its capital into its more profitable higher margin services targeted to specific industry markets 
these higher margin services include information technology staffing within the professional services segment  outsourcing projects within the project management segment and legal staffing within the temporary staffing segment
