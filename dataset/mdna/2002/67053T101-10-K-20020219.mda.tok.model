item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes that appear beginning on page overview we develop and market proprietary technologies and software products that enable the design and manufacture of semiconductors with subwavelength feature sizes 
we derive revenue from intellectual property and software licenses  maintenance and related technical services 
to date  we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from production and research and development licenses to integrated device manufacturers  or idms  and foundries of our phase shifting attendant subwavelength technologies and software licenses  as well as licenses of photomask verification software to semiconductor equipment resellers 
to date  we have entered into production licenses with five semiconductor manufacturers 
we expect to enter into additional production licenses as semiconductor manufacturers adopt our proprietary technologies for production 
production licenses grant licensees the right to use our phase shifting intellectual property and software to design and manufacture subwavelength integrated circuits  or ics 
in order for semiconductor manufacturers to enter into production licenses with us  these manufacturers must continue to embrace our proprietary technologies and not enter into agreements with our competitors in this regard 
we must also expend significant sales and marketing resources on these manufacturers with no guarantee of success 
in january  we acquired transcription for approximately million in series e preferred stock and million in notes payable  resulting in goodwill of million  which was being amortized on a straight line basis over five years and other intangible assets of million  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over two to five years 
in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized effective january  we have accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting and  as a result  our historical results of operations do not include the results of operations of transcription prior to january  on october   we completed the acquisition of cadabra for approximately million in common stock and options to purchase our common stock  as well as approximately million in acquisitions costs  resulting in goodwill of million  which was being amortized on a straight line basis over four years and other intangibles assets of million  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over two to five years 
in compliance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized effective january  we accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting and  as a result  our historical results of operations do no include the results of operations of cadabra prior to october  as a result of the acquisitions of transcription and cadabra  at december   we have goodwill and intangible assets of million  net of associated amortization 
such assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
at december   we do not consider goodwill and intangible assets to be impaired 
because of the significance of these acquisitions  we do not believe the discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations set forth below are indicative  nor should they be relied upon as an indicator  of our future performance 
in april  we sold a total of  shares of common stock at per share through our initial public offering 
the net proceeds  after underwriters commission and fees and other costs associated with the offering  totaled approximately million 
in april  we paid the balance of principal and accrued interest under the notes payables issued in connection with our january acquisition of transcription with a portion of the net proceeds 
the remaining proceeds have been used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop our revenue is derived from intellectual property and software licenses and maintenance and technical services 
revenue is recognized for the various contract elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of each element 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist but post contract customer services pcs is the only undelivered element  we recognize the fee  including up front payments for licenses  under the arrangement ratably over the contractual pcs period 
to date  we have not established vsoe for the service or annual maintenance elements of many of our products 
license revenue  including up front fees  is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  no significant post delivery obligations remain  the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is probable 
revenue for technical services is recognized as the services are performed or on a percentage of completion method of accounting  depending on the nature of the project 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized is that portion of the total contract price equal to the ratio of costs expended to date to the anticipated final total costs  based on current estimates of the costs to complete the project 
if the total estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss would be recognized currently 
maintenance services are typically priced based on a percentage of the license fee and have a one year term  renewable annually 
services provided to customers under maintenance agreements include technical product support and unspecified product upgrades 
deferred revenue includes billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition 
we have adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement requires enterprises to report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and selected information about reportable segments in interim financial reports 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products  geographic areas and major customers 
the method for determining what information to report is based upon the management approach  which requires us to report certain financial information related to continuing operations that is provided to our chief operating decision maker for the purpose of evaluating financial performance and resource allocation 
our chief operating decision maker reviews revenue by both geography and customer 
we are not organized into business units nor do we capture expenses or allocate resources based on segmentation of our business 
therefore  we believe that we operate in a single segment 
results of operations revenue 
revenue was million for  compared to million and million in and  respectively  representing increases of and for the respective periods 
our revenue increase was due primarily to increased production license revenues  increased revenue related to technical services and increased revenue due to a full year s revenue from our acquisition of cadabra  as well as continued adoption of our software and proprietary technology solution by companies throughout the design to silicon flow 
approximately of our revenue increase was due to our acquisitions of transcription and cadabra in and the remaining was from the continued adoption of our software and technology 
the breakdown of revenue by geographic regions in which our proprietary technologies and software products and services are delivered  as a percentage of our total revenue  is as follows year ended december  north america asia europe other the increase of revenue in to north america as a percentage of total revenue is primarily a result of increased production license revenues and increased revenue related to technical services from domestic customers 
revenue increased in amount in all other geographic regions  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue due to the relative greater increase in north american revenue 
the increase of revenue in to asia and europe as a percentage of total revenue is primarily a result of our acquisition of transcription  which led to increased access to international markets and customers for our products 
we expect that revenue will continue to increase due to the continued adoption of our technologies and expanded product offerings 
our actual revenue is substantially dependent on  among other factors  the adoption by semiconductor manufacturers  and other participants in the design to silicon flow  of our proprietary technologies and software products  and not those of our competitors or those developed internally 
our revenue is also subject to the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions 
costs and expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes primarily salary and related costs for engineers associated with maintenance and technical services 
cost of revenue was million for compared to million and  for and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to increased cost for engineers associated with providing technical services to customers  as well a full year s cost of additional engineers associated with maintenance added as a result of our acquisition of cadabra 
the increase in was primarily due to increased cost for engineers associated with maintenance and technical services  which resulted from an increased customer base related to our acquisitions of transcription in january and cadabra in october as a percent of revenue  cost of revenue was for compared to and for and  respectively 
our cost of revenue is dependent in part on our revenue 
to the extent our revenue increases or decreases due to  among other factors  those described above  our cost of revenue may increase or decrease 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses were million for compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to a full year s cost of personnel added as a result of our acquisition of cadabra  and to a lesser degree  increased costs associated with additional personnel in our expanding research and development efforts 
the increase in was primarily due to increased costs associated with additional personnel in our expanding research and development efforts and  to a lesser degree  to cost of personnel added as a result of our acquisitions 
as a percent of revenue  research and development expenses were in compared to and for and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future and expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in dollar amounts to support increased research and development efforts  but decline as a percentage of revenue in the long term 
our research and development expenses  as a percentage of revenue  are dependent in part on our revenue 
to the extent our revenue increases or decreases due to  among other factors  those described above  our research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue may increase or decrease 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  tradeshows and other marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses were million for compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to a full year s cost of personnel added as a result of our cadabra acquisition and costs associated with our expansion of foreign sales operations 
the increase in was primarily due to additional sales and marketing personnel  increased sales commissions and higher tradeshow expenses  and  to a lesser degree  to costs of personnel added as a result of our acquisitions 
as a percent of revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased to for compared to and for and  respectively 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amounts to support increased sales efforts  but decline as a percentage of revenue in the long term 
our sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of revenue  are dependent in part on our revenue 
to the extent our revenue increases or decreases due to  among other factors  those described above  our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue may increase or decrease 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting services 
general and administrative expenses were million for compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily the result of a full year s cost of personnel added as a result of our acquisition of cadabra and increased spending in legal and professional fees 
the increase in was primarily the result of increased spending in personnel  personnel related costs and professional fees and  to a lesser degree  to cost of personnel added as a result of our acquisitions of transcription and cadabra 
as a percent of revenue  general and administrative expenses were for compared to and for and  respectively 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amounts to support increased administrative efforts  but decline as a percentage of revenue in the long term 
our general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue  are dependent in part on our revenue 
to the extent our revenue increases or decreases due to among other factors  those described above  our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may increase or decrease 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
in  our acquisitions generated approximately million in identified intangibles and goodwill  which are currently being amortized over periods ranging from two to five years 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million in compared to million and  for and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily the result of a full year s amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquisition of cadabra in october the increase in was primarily the result of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquisitions of transcription in january and cadabra in october we expect amortization and depreciation expense  as calculated under the provisions of newly adopted sfas no 
 to be approximately million in amortization and depreciation expense could be affected by other acquisitions or impairment of existing identified intangible assets in future periods 
in process research and development 
in  we recorded charges of million or of revenue for acquired in process research and development primarily resulting from the acquisition of cadabra see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this amount was expensed on the acquisition date because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation is comprised of the amount of amortization related to i the difference between the exercise price of options granted and the estimated fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant  ii the fair value at the date of the acquisition of employee escrow shares issued to executives of cadabra in connection with the acquisition of cadabra  iii compensation expense related to certain restricted stock deemed to be variable as prescribed by fasb interpretation no 
and iv stock based compensation related to stock options granted to consultants 
we recognized stock based compensation of million for compared to million and million for and  respectively 
we are amortizing deferred stock based compensation over the vesting periods of the applicable options and restricted stock  using the multiple option method 
the stock based compensation expense relating to certain restricted stock and consultant options are remeasured by the company until the shares or options are fully vested 
as a result  the stock based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of the company s common stock fluctuates 
in addition  amortization of deferred stock based compensation could increase or decrease in future periods as a result of future grants or cancellations of options whose exercise prices are less than estimated fair market value on the date of grant  future grants or cancellation of restricted stock or future grants or cancellation of stock options to consultants 
interest expense 
interest expense was for compared to  and for and  respectively 
interest expense in relates to the notes payable associated with the acquisition of transcription in january in april  we paid the remaining principal and interest due under these notes with proceeds from our initial public offering 
interest income 
interest income was million for compared to million and  for and  respectively 
the decrease in is attributable to lower interest rates in compared to  partially offset by higher average cash and short term investment balances 
the increase in was primarily due to higher average cash and short term investment balances as a result of proceeds from our initial public offering in april we expect interest income to decrease in due to lower interest rates 
interest income could increase or decrease in future periods as a result of future changes in interest rates or changes in levels of investment balances 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
benefit from income taxes was million for compared to provisions for income taxes of  and for and  respectively 
our effective tax rate benefit for was only primarily due to goodwill and deferred stock based compensation amortizations which are not deductible for tax purposes 
our effective tax rate  excluding the impact of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets from our acquisitions and amortization of deferred stock based compensation  for was 
the provision for income taxes in was due to provisions for foreign taxes associated with foreign subsidiaries established in we expect our tax rate for to be approximately  excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets from our acquisitions and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
this estimate is based on current tax law  our current estimate of earnings and our expected distribution of income among various tax jurisdictions  all of which are subject to change 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
as of the same date  we had working capital of million  including deferred revenue of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during  compared with million used in net cash provided by operating activities in primarily reflects a net loss of million  offset by amortization and depreciation expenses of million  amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million and increases in deferred revenue of million 
net cash used in primarily reflects a loss of million  partially offset by amortization and depreciation expense of million and amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million during  compared with million in net cash used in consisted of net purchases of million in short term investments and million in purchases of computer hardware and software  office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash used in consisted of net purchases of million in short term investments and million in purchases of computer hardware and software and office furniture and equipment  offset by million provided in our acquisition of cadabra 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during  compared with million in net cash provided in primarily consisted of million of net proceeds from common stock option activity  million of net proceeds from employee stock purchase plan activity  and  from repayment of notes receivable for preferred and common stock 
net cash provided in primarily consisted of million net proceeds from our initial public offering and million of net proceeds from common stock option activity  partly offset by the principal payment of million under notes issued in connection with the acquisition of transcription 
we expect to experience continued growth in our operating expenses  particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business strategy 
as a result  we anticipate that such operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
our expenses are dependent in part on our level of revenue 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions of  or investments in  complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that the existing cash will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
in the event additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms or at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 all business combinations initiated after june  must be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if there are indicators such assets may be impaired for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   we are required to adopt sfas no 
effective january  we believe that these statements will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations other than from the cessation of goodwill amortization 
for year ended december   amortization of goodwill amounted to approximately million 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january  we believe that adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
our future results of operations and the other forward looking statements contained in this section  in particular the statements regarding our goals and strategies  revenue  costs of revenue  capital spending  depreciation and amortization  research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses  interest income and the tax rate  involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
our future revenue  expenses and operating results are all influenced by a number of factors  including those discussed above and those below  all of which are inherently difficult to forecast 
trends  risks and uncertainties additional factors which may affect our future results if the key markets within the semiconductor industry  especially semiconductor manufacturers  do not adopt our proprietary technologies and software products  we may be unable to generate sales of our products 
if the four key markets within the semiconductor industry  which we believe are semiconductor manufacturing  semiconductor equipment manufacturing  photomask manufacturers and design  do not adopt our proprietary technologies and software products  our revenue could decline 
we believe we design our technologies and products so that each key market within the semiconductor industry can work efficiently with the other markets 
for example  if designers do not adopt our technologies and products  it will be more difficult for them to design semiconductors that are understood and processed efficiently by mask manufacturers that do adopt our technologies and products 
in addition  we believe semiconductor manufacturers need to adopt our proprietary technologies and software products first in order to drive adoption by the other three markets 
semiconductor manufacturers define and develop the manufacturing process 
while designers  mask manufacturers and equipment manufacturers are not required to adopt our technologies and products in order to work with semiconductor manufacturers that do adopt them  we believe the efficiency of the manufacturing process with respect to such designers  mask manufacturers and equipment manufacturers is diminished if they do not 
if each key market of the semiconductor industry does not perceive our proprietary technologies and software products as the industry standard  our technologies and products could become less valuable and more difficult to license 
factors that may limit adoption of our subwavelength solution within the markets include our current and potential industry partners and customers may fail to adopt our technologies and products  the semiconductor industry may not need subwavelength processes if there is a slowdown in semiconductor manufacturing or a decrease in the demand for smaller semiconductor feature sizes  and the industry may develop alternative methods to produce subwavelength features with existing capital equipment due to a rapidly evolving market and the likely emergence of new technologies 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technologies which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue or increase our costs 
our success depends heavily upon proprietary technologies  specifically our patent portfolio 
the rights granted under our patents and patent applications may not provide competitive advantages to us 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
as a result of any such litigation  we could lose our proprietary rights and incur substantial unexpected operating costs 
litigation could also divert our resources  including our managerial and engineering resources 
we rely primarily on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights and prevent competitors from using our proprietary technologies in their products 
these laws and procedures provide only limited protection 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents  and our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies 
in addition  patent protection in foreign countries may be limited or unavailable where we have filed for and need such protection 
furthermore  if we fail to adequately protect our trademark rights  this could impair our brand identity and ability to compete effectively 
if we do not successfully protect our trademark rights  this could force us to incur costs to re establish our name or our product names  including significant marketing activities 
if third parties assert that our proprietary technologies and software products infringe their intellectual property rights  this could injure our reputation and limit our ability to license or sell our proprietary technologies or software products 
third parties  for competitive or other reasons  could assert that our proprietary technologies and software products infringe their intellectual property rights 
these claims could injure our reputation and decrease or block our ability to license or sell our software products 
for example  on march   asml masktools  inc filed a complaint alleging we infringe two us patents and have committed unfair or fraudulent business practice under the california business and professions code 
in the fourth quarter  we entered into a binding letter of intent with asml to settle the litigation 
however  until a final agreement is reached  the litigation will not be completely settled 
the defense of these claims could divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our company  as well as divert resources from current planned uses  such as hiring and supporting additional engineering personnel 
litigation is inherently uncertain  and an adverse decision could limit our ability to offer some features in our opc product 
in addition  third parties have advised us of literature that they believe to be relevant to our patents 
it is possible that this literature or literature we may be advised of in the future could negatively affect the scope or enforceability of our present or future patents and or result in costly litigation 
in addition  we are aware of and are evaluating certain patents with which our products  patents or patent applications may conflict 
if any of these patents are found to be valid  and we are unable to license such patents on reasonable terms  or if our products  patents  or patent applications are found to conflict with these patents  we could be prevented from selling our products  our patents may be declared invalid or our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
furthermore  a company could invite us to take a patent license 
if we do not take the license  the requesting company could contact our industry partners or customers and suggest that they not use our software products because we are not licensed under their patents 
this action by the requesting company could affect our relationships with these industry partners and customers and may prevent future industry partners and customers from licensing our software products 
the intensely competitive nature of our industry and the important nature of our technologies to our competitors businesses may contribute to the likelihood of being subject to third party claims of this nature 
we depend on the growth of the semiconductor industry and the current economic slowdown in this industry may cause a decrease in the demand for our proprietary technologies and software products and revenue 
we are dependent upon the general economic cycles of the semiconductor industry 
our ability to increase or even maintain our current revenue is largely dependent upon the continued demand by semiconductor manufacturers and each other key market within the semiconductor industry for integrated circuits  or ics  and ic related technologies 
the semiconductor industry has from time to time experienced economic downturns characterized by decreased product demand  production over capacity  price erosion  work slowdowns and layoffs 
we believe the semiconductor industry is currently experiencing such an economic downturn and  as a result  the sales of some of our proprietary technologies and software products have decreased and may continue to decrease 
defects in our proprietary technologies and software products could decrease our revenue and our competitive market share 
if our industry partners and customers discover any defects after they implement our proprietary technologies and software products  these defects could significantly decrease the market acceptance and sales of our software products  which could decrease our competitive market share 
any actual or perceived defects with our proprietary technologies and software products may also hinder our ability to attract or retain industry partners or customers  leading to a decrease in our revenue 
these defects are frequently found during the period following introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products 
despite testing prior to introduction  our software products may contain software errors not discovered until after customer implementation 
if our software products contain errors or defects  it could require us to expend significant resources to alleviate these problems  which could result in the diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts 
we rely on a small number of customers for a substantial amount of our revenue  and if our contracts with such customers were terminated  or if the revenues we expect to receive are otherwise reduced  we would need to replace this revenue through other sources 
approximately of our revenue for is derived from two customers 
if any of the contracts with these customers were to be terminated or not extended or renewed  or if the revenues we expect to receive are otherwise reduced  we could lose a material portion of our revenue 
we would need to replace this revenue with revenue from other customers by increasing the sale of our proprietary technologies and software products to our current customers and industry partners  or by entering into new contracts with new customers either of which would result in an unexpected diversion of management efforts and possible increases to operating expenses  with no immediate increase in revenue 
the market for software solutions that address the subwavelength gap problem is new and rapidly evolving 
we expect competition to intensify in the future  which could slow our ability to grow or execute our strategy 
we believe that the demand for solutions to the subwavelength gap problem may encourage many competitors to enter into our market 
as the market for software solutions to the subwavelength gap problem proliferates  if our competitors are able to attract industry partners or customers on a more accelerated pace than we can and retain them more effectively  we would not be able to grow and execute our strategy as quickly 
in addition  if customer preferences shift away from our technologies and software products as a result of the increase in competition  we must develop new proprietary technologies and software products to address these new customer demands 
this could result in the diversion of management attention or our development of new technologies and products may be blocked by other companies patents 
we must offer better products  customer support  prices and response time  or a combination of these factors  than those of our potential competitors 
in order for potential industry partners and customers to adopt  and expend their own resources to implement  our technologies and products  we must expend significant marketing resources  with no guarantee of success 
our proprietary technologies and software products involve a new approach to the subwavelength gap problem 
as a result  we must employ intensive and sophisticated marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective industry partners and customers about the benefits of our technologies and products 
our sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in in addition  even if our industry partners and customers adopt our proprietary technologies and software products  they must devote the resources necessary to fully integrate our technologies and products into their operations 
this is especially true for our industry partners so that they can begin to resell and market our solution to their customers 
if they do not make these expenditures  establishing our technologies and products as the industry standard to the subwavelength gap problem will be difficult 
we have a history of losses  we expect to incur losses in the future and we may be unable to achieve profitability 
we may not achieve profitability if our revenue increases more slowly than we expect or not at all 
in addition  our operating expenses are largely fixed  and any shortfall in anticipated revenue in any given period could cause our operating results to decrease 
for example  for the year ended december   revenues from cadabra design automation  inc  a corporation that we recently acquired  were less than anticipated 
we have not been profitable in any quarter  and our accumulated deficit was approximately million as of december  we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses in connection with increased funding for research and development and expansion of our sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  we expect to incur additional non cash charges relating to amortization of intangibles and deferred stock based compensation 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
if we do achieve profitability  we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
due to the nature of our customer contracts  our revenue may fluctuate greatly in any given quarter or year  making predictions as to future revenues highly uncertain 
we generate revenues through a variety of types of customer contacts  including production licenses  software licenses and research and development agreements 
the specific terms of these customer contracts may permit great variation in the amount of revenues that is generated under any one contract 
accordingly  our revenues may increase or decrease significantly in any given quarter or year based on the terms of our existing or future customer contracts 
thus  a contract may generate a material portion of our revenues in one quarter or year and not in the next 
factors that could affect the timing and amount of revenues recognized under our existing and future customer contracts could include the start date and volume of wafer production using our technology  the timing and amount of purchases of initial and additional software by our customers  the timing of customer roll out of new fabrication facilities using our technology  the completion date of research and or development milestones  scheduled increases or decreases in payment amounts over the life of a given contract  and issues relating to renewal of the contracts including whether the contract is renewed  and changes to payment amounts at renewal of the contract 
any potential dispute involving our patents or other intellectual property could include our industry partners and customers  which could trigger our indemnification obligations with them and result in substantial expense to us 
in any potential dispute involving our patents or other intellectual property  our licensees could also become the target of litigation 
this could trigger our technical support and indemnification obligations in some of our license agreements which could result in substantial expense to us 
in addition to the time and expense required for us to supply such support or indemnification to our licensees  any such litigation could severely disrupt or shut down the business of our licensees  which in turn could hurt our relations with our customers and cause the sale of our proprietary technologies and software products to decrease 
if we do not continue to introduce new technologies and software products or product enhancements ahead of rapid technological change in the market for subwavelength solutions  our operating results could decline and we could lose our competitive position 
we must continually devote significant engineering resources to enable us to introduce new technologies and software products or product enhancements to address the evolving needs of key markets within the semiconductor industry in solving the subwavelength gap problem 
we must introduce these innovations and the key markets within the semiconductor industry must adopt them before changes in the semiconductor industry  such as the introduction by our current and potential competitors of more advanced products or the emergence of alternative technologies  render the innovations obsolete  which could cause us to lose our competitive position 
these innovations are inherently complex  require long development cycles and a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability 
moreover  designers  mask manufacturers and equipment manufacturers must each respond to the demand of the market to design and manufacture masks and equipment for increasingly smaller and complex semiconductors 
our innovations must be viable and meet the needs of these key markets within the semiconductor industry before the consumer market demands even smaller semiconductors  rendering the innovations obsolete 
we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund any future innovations 
in addition  any revenue that we receive from enhancements or new generations of our proprietary technologies and software products may be less than the costs of development 
because of our limited operating history and our dependence on new technologies  any predictions about our future revenues and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer business history  and it is difficult to evaluate trends that may affect out business 
we were incorporated in october  and in february  we shipped our initial software product  ic workbench 
our limited operating history makes financial forecasting and evaluation of our business difficult 
since we have limited financial data  any predictions about our future revenues and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer business history 
because of our dependence on our development and industry acceptance of new technology  it is difficult to evaluate trends that may affect our business 
many of our current competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do and as a result  they may acquire a significant market share before we do 
our current competitors  or alliances among these competitors  may rapidly acquire significant market share 
these competitors may have greater name recognition and more customers which they could use to gain market share to our detriment 
we encounter direct competition from other direct providers of phase shifting  optical proximity correction  or opc  manufacturing data and automated layout creation technologies 
these competitors include such companies as avant  mentor graphics and prolific  inc we also compete with companies that have developed or have the ability to develop their own proprietary phase shifting and opc solutions  such as ibm 
these companies may wish to promote their internally developed products and may be reluctant to purchase products from us or other independent vendors 
our competitors may offer a wider range of products than we do and thus may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
these competitors may also be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities  offer more attractive terms to customers than we do and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
moreover  our competitors may establish relationships among themselves or with industry partners to enhance their services  including industry partners with which we may desire to establish a relationship 
we intend to pursue new  and maintain our current  industry partner relationships  which could result in substantial expenditures of management attention and resources  with no guarantee of success 
we expect to derive significant benefits  including increased revenue and customer awareness  from our current and potential industry partner relationships 
in our pursuit to maintain and establish partner relationships within each of the key markets in the semiconductor industry  we could expend significant management attention  resources and sales personnel efforts  with no guarantee of success 
to establish and maintain our partner relationships  we expend our limited financial resources on increasing our sales and business development personnel  trade shows and marketing within trade publications 
if we did not have to pursue potential industry partners  we could focus these resources exclusively on direct sales to our customers 
in addition  through our partner relationships  our partners resell  market  either jointly with us or unilaterally  and promote our technologies and products 
if these relationships terminate  such as due to our material breach of the contracts or the partners election to cancel the contract  which generally is permissible with prior notice to us  we would have to increase our own limited marketing and sales resources for these activities 
further  we may be unable to enter into new industry partner relationships if any of the following occur current or potential industry partners develop their own solutions to the subwavelength gap problem  or our current or potential competitors establish relationships with industry partners with which we seek to establish a relationship 
we have only recently entered into many of our current partner relationships 
these relationships may not continue or they may not be successful 
we also may be unable to find additional suitable industry partners 
we may be unable to consummate other potential acquisitions or investments or successfully integrate them with our business  which may slow our ability to expand the range of our proprietary technologies and software products 
to expand the range of our proprietary technologies and software products  in we acquired transcription and cadabra  and we may acquire or make investments in additional complementary businesses  technologies or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms  or consummate future acquisitions or investments  each of which could slow our growth strategy 
if we do acquire additional companies or make other types of acquisitions  we may have difficulty integrating the acquired products  personnel or technologies 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
in addition  any amortization of other intangible assets or impairment of goodwill or other assets or other charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our operating results 
we rely on the services of our founders and other key personnel  whose knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management 
in particular  we depend upon the continued services of our co founders y 
c 
buno pati  our president and chief executive officer and yao ting wang  our chief technology officer  whose vision of our company  knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
we do not have long term employment agreements with our senior management and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on their lives 
if any of our key employees left or was seriously injured and unable to work and we were unable to find a qualified replacement  it could slow our product development processes or we could otherwise have difficulty executing our business strategy 
during the period october to january  roger sturgeon  one of our directors and a senior executive of transcription  kevin maclean  senior vice president and general manager of transcription  and martin lefebrve  a member of our office of technology and senior executive of cadabra  left the company 
we have entered into consulting agreements with mr 
maclean and mr 
lefebrve under which they will assist us during the transition process and we have instituted various changes in our organizational structure to mitigate the impact of their departures 
mr 
sturgeon will continue to be a member of our board of directors 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to enter into similar arrangements if our key employees were to terminate their employment 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
it is likely that our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate from time to time and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future period 
as a result  the price of our common stock could decline 
historically  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated 
we may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results 
the following factors may cause these fluctuations our recent acquisition of transcription and cadabra  as well as future potential acquisitions by us  the timing and structure of our technology and or product license agreements  and changes in the level of our operating expenses to support our projected growth 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and could decline 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in response to factors  some of which are beyond our control  including changes in market valuations of other technology companies  conditions or trends in the semiconductor industry  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  any deviations in net revenue or in losses from levels expected by securities analysts  announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  contracts  acquisitions or partnerships  volume fluctuations  which are particularly common among highly volatile securities of technology related companies  and departures of key personnel 
general political or economic conditions  such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations in the united states or abroad  also could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the fluctuations in our stock price could result in securities class action litigation  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
volatility in the market price of our common stock could result in securities class action litigation 
any litigation would likely result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
the share prices of technology companies stocks have been highly volatile and have recently traded well below their historical highs 
as a result  investors in these companies often buy the stock at high prices only to see the price drop a short time later  resulting in a drop in value in the stock holdings of these investors 
our stock may not trade at the same levels as other technology stocks  or at its historical prices 
the accounting rules regarding revenue recognition may cause fluctuations in our revenue independent of our booking position 
the accounting rules we are required to follow require us to recognize revenue only when certain criteria are met 
as a result  for a given quarter it is possible for us to fall short in our revenue and or earnings estimates even though total orders are according to our plan or  conversely  to meet our revenue and or earnings estimates even though total orders fall short of our plan  due to revenue produced by deferred revenue 
orders for software support and professional services yield revenue over multiple quarters  often extending beyond the current fiscal year  or upon completion of performance  rather than at the time of sale 
the specific terms agreed to with a customer and or any changes to the rules interpreting such terms may have the effect of requiring deferral of product revenue in whole or in part or  alternatively  of requiring us to accelerate the recognition of such revenue for products to be used over multiple years 
we face operational and financial risks associated with international operations 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales 
for  compared to  the breakdown of our revenue by geographic region  as a percentage of our total revenue  was north america  and  asia  and  europe  and  and other  and  respectively 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition of cadabra  a nova scotia limited liability company  of our employees as of december  were located in ontario  canada 
we have only limited experience in developing  marketing  selling and supporting our proprietary technologies and software products  and managing our employees and operations  internationally 
we may not succeed in maintaining or expanding our international operations  which could slow our revenue growth 
we are subject to risks inherent in doing business in international markets 
these risks include fluctuations in exchange rates which may negatively affect our operating results  export controls which could prevent us from shipping our software products into and from some markets  changes in import export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our software products and reduce our market share in some countries  compliance with and unexpected changes in a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable resulting in longer collection periods  and economic or political instability 
we may be unable to continue to market our proprietary technologies and software products successfully in international markets 
we may need to raise additional funds to support our growth or execute our strategy and if we are unable to do so  we may be unable to develop or enhance our proprietary technologies and software products  respond to competitive pressures or acquire desired businesses or technologies 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion  develop new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures  or acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
these factors will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we are growing rapidly and must effectively manage and support our growth in order for our business strategy to succeed 
we have grown rapidly and will need to continue to grow in all areas of operation 
if we are unable to successfully integrate and support our existing and new employees  including those employees added as a result of our acquisition of cadabra  into our operations  we may be unable to implement our business strategy in the time frame we anticipate  or at all 
in addition  building and managing the support necessary for our growth places significant demands on our management as well as our limited revenue 
these demands have  and may continue to  divert these resources away from the continued growth of our business and implementation of our business strategy 
further  we must adequately train our new personnel  especially our technical support personnel  to adequately  and accurately  respond to and support our industry partners and customers 
if we fail to do this  it could lead to dissatisfaction among our partners or customers  which could slow our growth 
we must continually attract and retain engineering personnel or we will be unable to execute our business strategy 
we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our rapid growth and expansion 
we must continually enhance and introduce new generations of our phase shifting and opc technologies 
as a result  our future success depends in part on our ability to identify  attract  retain and motivate qualified engineering personnel with the requisite educational background and industry experience 
if we lose the services of a significant number of our engineers  it could disrupt our ability to implement our business strategy 
competition for qualified engineers is intense  especially in the silicon valley where our headquarters are located 
online security breaches could result in harm to our business operations and expose us to risk of loss  litigation or liability 
the secure transmission of confidential information over computer networks is essential to the success of our business 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may not be able to anticipate attacks against us in advance 
we incur substantial expense to protect against and remedy security breaches and their consequences  but we may not be able to prevent all such security breaches 
moreover  our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by such security breaches 
any misappropriation of confidential information  whether during the transmission of data or while it is stored on our servers could harm us in the following ways we may have to indemnify clients for loss of their confidential information  because our software is distributed electronically  an attack could cause disruption in the distribution of our products  including maintenance upgrades that we provide to our customers  we may suffer theft of our intellectual property  including trade secrets and copyrighted code  and we may suffer disruption in the areas of product development  research  and operations 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively effect our operations 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers  which could result in higher expenses and or lower revenue 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel of our sales and support staff more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect the sales of our products 
also as a result of terrorism  the united states has entered into an armed conflict  which could have a further impact on our domestic and international sales 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
our operations are primarily located in california and  as a result  are subject to power loss and other natural disasters 
our business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities  computer systems and personnel  which are primarily located in or near our principal headquarters in san jose  california 
in the spring of  california experienced power outages due to a shortage in the supply of power within the state 
in the event of an acute power shortage  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  and our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages we or our customers or industry partners may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and industry partners  or obtain new customers or industry partners  and could result in loss of revenue 
furthermore  the deregulation of the energy industry in california has caused power prices to increase 
if wholesale prices continue to increase  our operating expenses will likely increase 
in addition  san jose exists on or near a known earthquake fault zone 
our facilities are susceptible to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters  such as fires  floods and similar events 
although we maintain general business insurance against fires and some general business interruptions  there can be no assurance that the amount of coverage will be adequate in any particular case 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we place our investments in us government obligations and aaa rated money market funds with maximum allowable maturities of one year of a single issue and maximum average maturity of the portfolio of six months 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and type of instrument 
at december   we had a short term investment portfolio of million  excluding investments classified as cash and cash equivalents 
management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date 
we consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and money market funds to be cash equivalents 
to date  all marketable securities have had contractual maturities of one year or less and have been classified as held to maturity and recorded on the balance sheet at cost 
interest  dividends and realized gains and losses are included in interest income 
realized gains and losses are recognized using the specific identification method to determine the cost of securities sold 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a significant portion of our sales in japan are denominated in japanese yen 
net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on our results of operations for   or at december   of our accounts receivable was denominated in foreign currencies  primarily yen 
we currently do not use a hedging program to protect against our exposure against foreign currency risk
