item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  including those set forth under the caption risk and uncertainties and elsewhere in this report  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
we are a discovery genetics company with the tools  information and strategies for determining the medical impact of genes and genetic variations 
utilizing a novel population genetics approach  we are systematically identifying potential disease related genes that affect significant portions of the overall population 
our core technology components include the massarray system for genetic variation and drug target validation  a broad portfolio of single nucleotide polymorphisms snp assays and diverse human population samples 
we believe that our technology should enable us to screen virtually all human genes in relation to all diseases across large human populations 
using these technologies in house and in partnerships  we are generating a portfolio of candidate disease gene markers associated with significant human health disorders  including cardiovascular disease  cancer  diabetes  stress and obesity 
by focusing on disease genes with a broad population impact  we expect to play an important role in bringing new therapeutic products to the market while maximizing the return on our drug development efforts 
in september  we completed our acquisition of gemini genomics  a company based in the united kingdom 
gemini genomics was a clinical genomics company focused on the discovery and commercialization of novel gene based drug discovery targets 
gemini had collected and analyzed information from a wide range of human population groups  including twins  disease affected families  isolated  or founder  populations and drug trial subjects 
under the terms of our agreement with gemini genomics  holders of gemini genomics ordinary shares received of a share of newly issued sequenom common stock in exchange for each ordinary share of gemini genomics 
holders of gemini genomics american depository shares adss received of a share of newly issued sequenom common stock in exchange for each gemini genomics ads 
as a result of the gemini genomics transaction  sequenom issued approximately million shares and assumed outstanding options and warrants to purchase approximately million additional shares 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
net cash and other tangible assets totaling approximately million were acquired  in addition to approximately million of intangible assets  and million of in process research and development 
we estimate that our integration expenses will total approximately million 
these expenses include both transaction and integration costs 
as of december   we had incurred approximately million of transaction and integration related costs 
since we began operations in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and application of products  technologies and services to analyze genetic variations  or snps  and  more recently  to determine their association with disease 
our products include the massarray system  disposable massarray kits consisting of spectrochip chips and reagents  a snp assay portfolio and a portfolio of proprietary information on genes implicated in disease 
our services include assay design for massarray customers  in house validation projects using our massarray system and disease association studies using our proprietary dna banks 
we also use the massarray technology to identify the medical utility of genes and develop snp panels based on the correlation of snps to specific diseases 
we expect that the merger with gemini genomics will expand our ability to perform disease gene association and genetic marker validation studies 
we believe this will provide a pipeline of validated genes for downstream development of diagnostic and therapeutic products 
we commenced sales of our first product  the massarray system  in january through december   we had placed a total of systems with leading companies and institutions 
we have sold our products to genomics  pharmacogenomics  diagnostic and agricultural biotechnology companies  as well as leading research institutions  in the united states  europe and asia 
through december  our product revenues consisted of revenues from the placement of massarray systems  the sales of massarray kits used in the operation of our massarray systems and the licensing of our proprietary software  which is licensed separately from the massarray system 
our service revenues consist of genetic validation services  with revenue recognized as phases of projects are completed 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future  and expect all expenses to increase  as we expand development and commercialization of new information based products  and launch our pharmaceuticals business unit 
the addition of three foreign based gemini genomics subsidiaries will also result in an increase in operating costs 
we are integrating our historical genetic discovery business with gemini genomics  and as a result  beginning in  we will report financial results and progress of our operations in the context of two distinct business units sequenom genetic systems and sequenom pharmaceuticals 
sequenom genetic systems will include the company s operations that support sales of massarray systems and consumables and the provision of genetic services 
sequenom pharmaceuticals will include operations relating to genetic discovery  validation of candidate genes  target discovery and ultimately the development of diagnostic and therapeutic products 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
certain of these accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to our investors understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed below 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing these financial statements  management uses its judgments to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulleting sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues are recognized  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenues from the massarray system  consumables and proprietary software  are recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue allocated to maintenance fees for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
revenues from snp validation services are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service  which is generally delivery of snp assay information 
grant revenue is recorded as the research expenses relating to the grants are incurred  provided that the amounts received are not refundable if the research is not successful 
amounts received that are refundable if the research is not successful would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon the grantor s acceptance of the success of the research results 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates are as follows accrued acquisition and integration costs 
to the extent that exact amounts are not determinable  the company has estimated amounts for direct costs of the acquisition of gemini genomics and the related integration costs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
accrued acquisition and integration related costs totaled approximately million at december  and represented the amount the company expects to incur related to facility exit costs 
we expect that it may take us from six months to two years  or possibly longer  to sublease the identified surplus space 
materially different results would be likely if it takes longer than expected to sublease or terminate current lease agreements or if financial terms of subleases or termination of agreements are different than estimated 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company periodically re evaluates the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of its long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in the company s business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
goodwill and other intangibles  primarily resulting from the acquisition of gemini genomics totaled approximately million at december  valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies in the multiple tax jurisdictions where we operate  and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have infinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of during  we will engage an independent third party to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  we have preliminarily estimated that the adoption of fas will result in a one time  non cash charge in excess of million in the first quarter of  and will be reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
in october  the sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
and portions of apb opinion no 
although sfas no 
retains many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
 the new rules significantly change the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
this distinction is important because assets to be disposed of are stated at the lower of their fair values or carrying amounts and depreciation is no longer recognized 
the new rules also will supersede the provisions of apb opinion no 
with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in discontinued operations in the period in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb in addition  more dispositions will qualify for discontinued operations treatment in the income statement 
the company will apply the new rules on accounting for such assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  and does not believe that the application will have a material effect on the earnings and financial position of the company 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues increased to approximately million in  from approximately in and approximately  in all revenues in the years prior to resulted from research and development grants 
product revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  these product revenues were derived from the sale of massarray systems  disposable kits containing our proprietary spectrochip chips and licensing of our proprietary software 
the increase in product revenue from to resulted from an increase in the number of systems sold from in to in the number of systems sold  in addition to the increase in our installed base from to  resulted in the increase in our spectrochip chip and proprietary software revenues 
service revenues were approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in service revenues resulted from an increase in the number and magnitude of service agreements in we expect that future revenues will be affected by  among other things  customer research budgets  new product introductions  competitive conditions and government research funding 
gross margin on product and service revenue total gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from a larger percentage of higher margin products being sold in compared to we believe that gross margin in future periods will be affected by  among other things  mix of products and services sold  competitive conditions  sales volumes  and royalty payments on licensed technologies 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and million in these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  materials costs and costs related to improvements of our existing products as well as validation of products under development 
the million increase from to resulted from an increase in number of personnel to support our increase in research and development collaborations  as well as the acquisition of gemini genomics in the third quarter of  whose research and development expenses were consolidated with ours in the fourth quarter of the million increase from to consisted of approximately million in increased materials and other costs related to research and development of products and services and collaborative agreements  approximately million from increased personnel expenses associated with additional research and development personnel and a million charge related to forgiveness of loans granted to research and development executives in connection with the exercise of stock options 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for sales and marketing  customer support  business development  legal  finance and human resource personnel  and their related function s expenses 
the million increase from to resulted primarily from additional sales  marketing and customer support activities and expenses associated with filing patent applications on our intellectual property 
in addition  as a result of the acquisition of gemini genomics at the end of the third quarter of  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to include gemini s selling  general and administrative expenses which are reflected in our fourth quarter results 
approximately million of the million increase from to resulted from charges related to the february forgiveness of loans granted to executives in in connection with the exercise of stock options and the transition and resignation of a former ceo 
the remaining increase consisted of approximately million from the expansion of our sales  marketing  business development and customer support teams to support the commercialization of our products  approximately million in additional expenses associated with our new san diego facilities and other general expenses related to the overall expansion of our operations  and approximately  in additional insurance and general legal costs as a result of becoming a publicly traded company 
in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of gemini genomics in  we recorded a non recurring  non cash in process research and development charge of million 
this amount represents the value of the research and development projects acquired from gemini that were not technologically feasible or did not have alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with the acquisition of gemini genomics  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patents 
these intangible assets will be amortized over three to five years 
the amortization of approximately  represents the amortization of the intangibles assets from the date of acquisition in september through the end of amortization of deferred stock based compensation deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the estimated fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of options at the date of grant 
during the year ended december   we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation totaling approximately  compared to in and million in these amounts are being amortized over the vesting periods of the individual stock options in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
we expect to record amortization for deferred compensation approximately as follows  during  and  during the amount included million related to a remeasurement of options originally granted to a former ceo in interest income interest income was million in  compared to million in  and approximately million in the decrease from to resulted from lower interest rates and lower average balances of interest bearing cash and investments 
the increase from to resulted from higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in  from the investment of our february ipo proceeds of approximately million 
interest expense interest expense was approximately  in  compared to approximately million in  and approximately  in interest expense in resulted primarily from interest payments under our capital lease obligations and long term debt 
the interest expense amount in of million is comprised of approximately million of non cash interest expense recorded upon conversion of debt of million million german deutsche marks exchanged at a rate of deutsche marks per us dollar into common stock and approximately  of interest related to capital lease obligations  offset in part by approximately  of a non cash gain recorded upon issuance of common stock to extinguish long term interest payable 
income taxes at december   the company has federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the difference between the federal and state tax loss carryforwards is attributable to the capitalization of research and development expenses for state tax purposes and the limitation on the california loss carryforwards beginning in and the limitation in earlier years 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
approximately  of the state tax loss carryforwards expired in and the state tax loss carryforwards will continue to expire in unless previously utilized 
the company also has german and united kingdom uk net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively  which may be carried forward indefinitely 
approximately  of the uk net operating loss carryforwards was acquired with the purchase of gemini genomics and is fully reserved by the valuation allowance 
to the extent these uk net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  such benefit will be recorded as a purchase accounting adjustment 
the valuation allowance includes a future tax benefit of approximately  related to stock option deductions  which  if recognized  will be allocated to additional paid in capital 
the company also has federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in unless previously utilized 
pursuant to internal revenue code sections and  use of the company s federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited due to a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
use of the company s uk net operating loss carryforwards may be limited upon the occurrence of certain events such as the discontinuation or change in the nature or conduct of the business 
liquidity and capital resources in february  we completed our initial public offering ipo raising net proceeds of approximately million 
prior to our ipo  we funded our operations with million of private equity financings  million in loans and convertible loans and million from equipment financing arrangements 
at december   cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash totaled million compared to million at december  our cash reserves are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including investment grade corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market accounts 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared with million in a net loss of million in was partially offset by non cash charges of million of in process research and development resulting from the acquisition of gemini genomics  million for depreciation and amortization expense and million related to stock based compensation 
investing activities  other than the changes in our short term investments and the million of cash acquired from gemini  used million in cash during from expenditures for leasehold improvements  our ultra high throughput genotyping facility and laboratory equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in financing activities in included approximately  of proceeds from employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises and borrowings  net of repayments  under capital lease obligations of approximately  financing activities in included the receipt of net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering in february the following table summarized our contractual obligations at december  in millions contractual obligations total less than year years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations other commitments and contingencies that may result in contractual obligations to pay are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through at least the next months 
however  the actual amount of funds that we will need during or after the next months will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated 
these factors include the level of our success in selling our massarray systems  consumables  assays and services  the level of our sales and marketing expenses  the extent to which we enter into collaborations or joint ventures  our ability to introduce and sell new products and services  the level of our acquisition and integration expenses  including tax and other liabilities from the gemini genomics or other acquisitions  our ability to exit existing excess facilities on terms that are financially acceptable  the level of our expenses associated with litigation or termination of agreements  the costs and timing of obtaining new patent rights  the costs and expenses associated with defending or asserting any intellectual property claims or litigation  the extent to which we acquire technologies or companies  and regulatory changes and competition and technological developments in the market 
we have a million bank line of credit  of which million is available for borrowing 
in addition  we have established an million capital equipment financing agreement  million of which was available for utilization at december  we have no commitments for any additional financings 
when we require additional funds  general market conditions or the then current market price of our common stock may not support capital raising transactions such as an additional public or private offering of our common stock 
if additional funds are required and we are unable to obtain them on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce further commercialization of our products  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge with another entity 
if we raise additional funds by selling shares of our capital stock  the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the great british pound gbp  the euro  the swedish krona sek and the canadian dollar can 
the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the us dollar 
we have significant exposure to exchange rate effects following the merger with gemini genomics as substantially all of gemini s cash is denominated in us dollars  leading to potential exchange gain and losses if the gbp and us dollar exchange rate changes significantly 
a strengthening of the british pound against the us dollar could result in a material increase in our losses for any given financial period 
we have made net foreign currency gains in the year ended december   but you should not view this gain as an indicator of future financial performance in this area 
the table below sets forth our currency exposure ie  those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognized in the income and expenditure account on our net monetary assets and liabilities 
these exposures consist of our monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency used by us or our subsidiary or affiliate having the asset or liability 
as of december  functional currency of operations net foreign monetary assets liabilities us dollars other in millions great british pound a movement of in the us dollar to pound exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  we had no off balance sheet  or unrecognized  gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning or end of the year ended december  we had no deferred gains or losses during the year covered
