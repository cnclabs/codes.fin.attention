item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leading independent owner and operator of over  wireless communications towers in the united states and puerto rico 
we generate revenues from our two primary businesses  site leasing and site development 
in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own or manage for others 
the towers that we own have either been constructed by us at the request of a carrier  built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired 
in our site development business  we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own networks 
we are continuing to shift our revenue stream from project driven revenues more to recurring revenues through the leasing of antenna space at or on communications facilities 
we intend to emphasize our site leasing business through the leasing and management of tower sites and we believe we have well positioned ourselves to perform many of the other types of services that wireless service providers need in connection with the operation and maintenance of a wireless telecommunications network 
those services include installation  maintenance and upgrading of radio transmission equipment  antennas  cabling and other connection equipment  electricity  backhaul  equipment shelters  data collection and network monitoring 
site leasing services site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies 
revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts 
each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of years with five year renewable options 
almost all of our leases contain specified rent escalators which average per year  including the option periods 
leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease agreements 
rental amounts received in advance are recorded in other liabilities current and long term 
cost of site leasing revenue consist of payments for rental on ground and other underlying property  repairs and maintenance  utilities  insurance  and property taxes 
for any given tower  such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period 
as such  operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as additional customers are added 
our same tower revenue growth and same tower cash flow growth at december   on the  towers we owned as of december  was and  respectively  based on tenant leases signed and revenues annualized as of december  and site development services site development services revenues are also received primarily from wireless communications companies 
our site development customers engage us on a project by project basis  and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty 
site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price  or milestone  basis 
time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered 
for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis  we bill the client  and recognize revenue  based on the completion of agreed upon phases or milestones of the project on a per site basis 
upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis  we recognize the revenue related to that phase 
the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed basis 
our site development projects generally take from to months to complete 
our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract 
this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts 
these amounts are based on estimates  and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion 
the average site development contract for consulting was approximately  per contract in and for construction was approximately  per contract in revenue from our site development business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities  which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients capital expenditures  the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period  weather and other factors 
cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all material costs  salaries and labor costs  including payroll taxes  subcontract labor  vehicle expense and other costs directly related to the projects 
all costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 
we have focused our capital expenditures on building new towers and acquiring existing towers and related businesses 
our average construction cost of a new tower is currently approximately  while we believe the industry s average acquisition cost of a tower over the last two years has been approximately  as a result of these favorable economics  we have historically elected to build the majority of our towers 
however  this trend changed somewhat in as the average acquisition price per tower declined 
we acquired more towers than we built in the year while we have focused primarily on building new towers for growth  we have also acquired  towers as of december  our acquisition strategy has focused on smaller acquisition opportunities from non carriers and small carrier transactions 
we seek to acquire towers where we can increase cash flow to substantially reduce the tower cash flow multiple paid at acquisition through additional tenant lease up 
during the year ended december  we acquired towers 
the tower acquisitions were completed at an aggregate purchase price of million exclusive of acquisition costs  an average price of approximately  per tower 
in august  we announced that we were adjusting our new tower build construction plan and operation to produce fewer towers per quarter 
in connection with this adjustment  we recorded a million charge in the third quarter of included in this charge was a write off of costs previously reflected on our balance sheet as construction in process for certain new tower build sites for which development activity had been abandoned  costs of employee separation for certain employees and costs associated with the closing and consolidation of selected offices that were previously utilized primarily in our new asset development activities 
in february  we announced that as a result of capital market conditions we were further reducing our planned capital expenditures for new tower development activities in and subsequently suspending any material new investment for additional towers 
we have reduced the number of towers expected to be built or acquired in to approximately to towers 
under current capital market conditions we do not anticipate building or buying a material number of new towers beyond those we are currently contractually obligated to build or buy 
in connection with this restructuring plan we anticipate incurring charges of between million and million related to the disposal of new tower build and acquisition construction in process  costs of employee separation  costs associated with the closing of offices and other items 
the amount of the charge related to asset disposals will be determined primarily by the fair value of costs of construction in process with respect to those new builds we choose to dispose of 
most of the charge is expected to be incurred in the first quarter of with the remainder incurred in the second quarter of we believe that if the capital markets conditions remain difficult for the telecommunications industry  wireless service providers will choose to conserve capital and may not spend as many dollars as currently anticipated 
we believe our revenues and gross profit from the site development consulting and construction segments of our business may vary in response to the capital markets 
short term  variable capital markets conditions may impact carrier demand for our tower space 
we believe that  over the longer term however  site leasing revenues will continue to increase as carriers continue to deploy new antenna sites to address issues of network capacity and quality  increasing the recurring revenue stream we enjoy from existing tenants 
results of operations as we continue to shift our revenue mix more towards site leasing  operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results 
you should be aware of the dramatic changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results 
we expect that the acquisitions consummated to date and any future acquisitions  as well as our new tower builds  will have a material impact on future revenues  expenses and net loss 
revenues  cost of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest income and interest expense each increased significantly in the year ended december  as compared to  and some or all of those items may continue to increase significantly in future periods

as a percentage of total revenue  excluding non cash compensation expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for from in during the twelve months ended december   we recorded a million charge relating to a reduction in the scale of our new tower construction operations 
approximately million of this charge related to costs that were previously reflected in our balance sheet as construction in process 
the remaining million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for employees and the costs associated with the closing and consolidation of selected offices that were primarily utilized in our new asset development activities 
during we approved a restructuring plan and anticipate incurring charges of between million and million relating to a further reduction in our new tower development activities 
this charge will be comprised of costs related to the disposal of new tower build and acquisition construction in process  costs related to employee separation  costs associated with the closing of offices  and other items 
the amount of the charge related to asset disposals will be determined primarily by the fair value of new tower backlog and construction in process with respect to those new builds we choose to dispose of 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for as compared to million for this increase was directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets  primarily towers  we owned in as compared to as our fixed assets begin to mature we will be continuing to evaluate the useful lives of the assets and may decide to change these useful lives based on the circumstances 
if the useful lives of assets are reduced  depreciation may be accelerated in future years

gross profit margin on site development construction decreased to for from in due to an increase in the use of subcontractor labor 
gross profit for the site leasing business increased in from in the increased gross profit was due to the substantially greater number of towers owned and the greater average revenue per tower in the period

the increase in interest expense is due to increased interest associated with the senior credit facility  amortization of deferred financing charges and original issue discount  partially offset by increased interest capitalization as a result of increased construction activity 
the extraordinary item in of million relates to the write off of deferred financing fees associated with a prior bank credit agreement

our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries 
we conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries 
accordingly  our only source of cash to pay our obligations  other than financings  is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries 
even if we decided to pay a dividend on or make a distribution of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend 
our ability to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our senior credit facility and the indentures related to our senior notes and senior discount notes 
net cash provided by operations during the year ended december  was million as compared to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to increased interest expense 
net cash used in investing activities for year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of tower acquisitions in versus net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in was attributable to our offering of our senior notes closed in february and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
our balance sheet reflected negative working capital of million as of december  and negative working capital of million as of december  our negative working capital balances are primarily due to the timing of receipts for accounts receivable  payment of accounts payable  accrued expenses and interest payable related to our business operations 
in february  we issued million of senior notes due  which produced net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering expenses 
interest on these notes is payable on february and august of each year  beginning august  the senior notes are unsecured and are pari passu in right of payment with our other existing and future senior indebtedness 
the senior notes place certain restrictions on  among other things  the incurrence of debt and liens  issuance of preferred stock  payment of dividends or other distributions  sale of assets  transactions with affiliates  sale and leaseback transactions  certain investments and our ability to merge or consolidate with other entities 
at december  we had million outstanding on our senior notes

the senior discount notes mature on march  in june  sba telecommunications  inc  our principal subsidiary  entered into a million senior secured credit facility 
the facility provides for a million term loan and a million revolving loan  the availability of which is based on compliance with certain covenants 
sba telecommunications drew the full million of the term loan during as well as million of the revolver 
the term loan and the revolving loan mature june  and repayment of the term loan begins in september borrowings under the senior credit facility accrue interest at the euro dollar rate plus a margin or a base rate plus a margin  as defined in the agreement 
the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of sba telecommunications and its subsidiaries 
the facility also places certain restrictions on  among other things  the incurrence of debt and liens  the sale of assets  capital expenditures  transactions with affiliates  sale and lease back transactions and the number of towers that can be built without anchor tenants 
as of december  we were in full compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit facility and the remaining million under the senior credit facility was available to us 
at december   we had the million term loan outstanding under the senior credit facility at variable rates of to and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at a variable rate 
our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million which was principally used for the construction and acquisition of new towers in our portfolio and the acquisition of two site development construction companies 
we currently plan to make total cash capital expenditures during the year ending december  of million to million 
all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support or increase our tower portfolio 
in order to manage our indebtedness we may from time to time sell assets  issue equity  or repurchase  restructure or refinance some or all of our debt 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  or to pay interest on  our debt obligations  and our ability to refinance any such debt obligations including the senior notes or the senior discount notes  or to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control

inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgement in their application 
in other cases  management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease agreements 
rental amounts received in advance are recorded in other liabilities 
site development projects in which the company performs consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis 
time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered 
for those site development contracts in which the company performs work on a fixed price basis  site development billing and revenue recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis 
upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis  the company recognizes the revenue related to that phase 
revenue related to services performed on uncompleted phases of site development projects was not recorded by the company at the end of the reporting periods presented as it was not material to the company s results of operations 
any estimated losses on a particular phase of completion are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident 
site development projects generally take from to months to complete 
revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract 
this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts 
these amounts are based on estimates  and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion 
the asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all material costs  salaries and labor costs  including payroll taxes  subcontract labor  vehicle expense and other costs directly related to the projects 
all costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 
cost of site leasing revenue include rent  maintenance and other tower expenses 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset  industry practice and asset maintenance policies 
maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred 
asset classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows towers and related components years furniture  equipment and vehicles years buildings and improvements years capitalized costs incurred subsequent to when an asset is originally placed in service are depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective asset 
changes in an asset s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively  with the book value of the asset at the time of the change being depreciated over the revised remaining useful life term 
we reduced the useful lives on towers 
this change in useful lives did not have a material impact in goodwill we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss of unamortized goodwill 
the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of unamortized goodwill include a significant negative trend in our operating results or cash flows  a decrease in demand for our services  a change in the competitive environment and other industry and economic factors 
we measure impairment of unamortized goodwill utilizing the undiscounted cash flow method over the remaining estimated life 
any impairment loss would be calculated as the amount which the carrying amount of the unamortized balance exceeds its fair value 
as of december   we determined that there has been no impairment of goodwill 
we expect to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in the first quarter of with the adoption of sfas  we will assess the impact based on a two step approach to assess goodwill based on applicable reporting units and will reassess any intangible assets  including goodwill  recorded in connection with our previous acquisitions 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we are currently assessing  but have not yet determined the impact adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements  however  we believe it may be material 
as of december   we had unamortized goodwill and covenants not to compete of million 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses carried forward before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax liability as of december  was million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments 
these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
during the year ended december  we were subject to interest rate risk on our senior credit facility 
at december  our fixed rate debt consisted primarily of the balance on the senior notes and the accreted balance of the senior discount notes 
in the future  we may be subject to increased rate risk on our senior credit facility  interest rate swap or any other further financing we may enter into 
the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and weighted average interest rates associated with our existing long term debt instruments  assuming our actual level of long term indebtedness thereafter in thousands long term debt fixed rate fixed rate term loan  million  variable rates to at december  revolving loan  variable rate at december  notes payable  variable rates to at december  in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates 
the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap is million 
the maturity date of the interest rate swap matches the principal maturity date of the senior notes  the underlying debt february 
this swap involves the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
the variable rates are based on six month euro rate plus and are reset on a semi annual basis 
our primary market risk exposure relates to the interest rate risk on long term and short term borrowings and on our interest rate swap agreement  our ability to refinance our senior notes and our senior discount notes at maturity at market rates and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and exceed financial covenants 
we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding long term and short term debt through our use of fixed and variable rate debt 
while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt  we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis 
senior discount note disclosure requirements the indentures governing our senior notes and our senior discount notes require certain financial disclosures for restricted subsidiaries separate from unrestricted subsidiaries and the disclosure to be made of tower cash flow  as defined in the indentures  for the most recent fiscal quarter and adjusted consolidated cash flow  as defined in the indentures  for the most recently completed four quarter period 
as of december  we had no unrestricted subsidiaries 
tower cash flow  as defined in the indentures  for the quarter ended december  was million 
adjusted consolidated cash flow for the year ended december  was million
