reference is made in particular to the risk factors set forth in the subsection item business risk factors that may affect future operating results to this report and the discussions set forth below in this report under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are pioneering the use of our proprietary bio engineered acrylic beads  known as microspheres  for medical applications using embolotherapy techniques and also to develop potential applications in several non embolotherapy applications 
embolotherapy is a minimally invasive procedure in which embolic materials  such as our microspheres  are delivered through a catheter into the blood vessels to inhibit blood flow to tumors or vascular defects or to control blood loss presurgically 
our initial product  embosphere microspheres  is targeted for the treatment of hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous malformations 
hypervascularized tumors are tumors that have a large number of blood vessels feeding them and include certain tumors affecting the brain and spinal cord  tumors in the uterus  known as uterine fibroids  and tumors associated with primary liver cancer 
by selectively blocking the tumor s blood supply  embolotherapy is designed to cause the tumor to shrink and necrose 
based on preliminary research  we believe that our microsphere technology platform can also be adapted to deliver drugs  living tissue or genetic material to targeted sites 
biosphere medical  inc was originally incorporated in under the name biosepra  inc  as a chromatography media company 
during  we strategically refocused our business on the development and commercialization of our proprietary microspheres for medical applications 
in february  we acquired a ownership interest in biosphere medical sa  a french societe anonyme  which we refer to as bmsa 
between april and november  we acquired the remaining ownership interest in bmsa 
bmsa retains the license to the embolotherapy device that is the main focus of our business 
in may  we sold substantially all of our assets relating to our former core business  chromatography  and changed our name to biosphere medical  inc as of december   sepracor inc  a specialty pharmaceutical company  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in april  we received clearance from the united states fda for embolization of hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous malformations  excluding specific marketing approval for the uterine fibroids 
in december  we commenced our pivotal phase ii clinical testing  under an investigational device exemption  of the safety and effectiveness of treating uterine fibroids by uterine artery embolization with our embosphere microspheres 
an investigational device exemption is a regulatory exemption granted by the fda to medical device manufacturers for the purpose of conducting clinical studies 
we intend  pending fda clearance or approval for this indication  to promote our microspheres for the treatment of uterine fibroids 
we do not anticipate receiving this clearance or approval before the last fiscal quarter of  if at all 
we received ce mark approval of our embosphere microspheres product in the european union in ce mark approval is a certification granted by european regulatory bodies  or by some manufacturers with satisfactory quality systems  that substantiates the compliance of products with specific standards of quality and or safety 
this approval is generally required prior to the commercialization of a medical device in the european union 
in january  we received marketing approval of our embosphere microspheres product in australia and canada 
our revenue is primarily generated from product sales of embosphere microspheres in the united states  european union  australia and canada 
product revenues also include the sale of barium and other ancillary products manufactured by us or by third parties 
although we have not received fda clearance or approval to market our embosphere microspheres for the specific use in the treatment of uterine fibroids  we believe that a majority of our revenue in the united states for the years ended december  and was derived from the sale of embosphere microspheres for use in uterine fibroid embolization 
during  we established two wholly owned subsidiaries to pursue the development of other microsphere technologies 
in april  we established biosphere medical japan  inc  a delaware corporation  to develop and commercialize embosphere microspheres as well as hepasphere sap microspheres in asia 
in december  we established bsmd ventures  inc  also a delaware corporation  to explore and develop non embolotherapy applications with a specific focus on tissue engineering uses 
we have experienced operating losses in each fiscal period since our inception 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and short term marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in connection with the execution of our business plan  we expect to experience continued losses for the next fiscal year 
the sale of our former chromatography business in has been presented in the financial statements in accordance with discontinued operations accounting principles 
accordingly  the results of all discontinued operations have been excluded from the continuing operations and presented separately in the accompanying selected financial data 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note b to our consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical in gaining full understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized when requested goods are shipped to customers and collection is considered probable 
management establishes reserves for potential sales returns and evaluates  on a monthly basis  the adequacy of those reserves based upon realized experience 
under our current policy  only those products on a customers initial order qualify for credit returns 
to date  returns have been minimal and immaterial 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant change in product satisfaction and any resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical payment experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
substantially all of our receivables are due from hospitals  distributors  health care clinics  and managed care systems located throughout the united states  australia  canada  and europe 
a significant portion of products sold  both foreign and domestic  are ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on liquidity and profitability of our customer base 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities in process and on hand and record a provision for production loss and obsolete inventory based primarily on actual loss experience and on our estimated forecast of product demand 
therefore  significant increases in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in production loss while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our costs of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we would have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize a reduced per unit cost at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our production process and forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in production yield or product demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
deferred taxes we use the asset and liability accounting method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current statutory tax rates 
a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets is recorded if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management evaluates  on a quarterly basis  the ability to recover the deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance 
due to the size of our net operating loss carryforward in relation to our history of unprofitable operations we have not recognized any of our net deferred tax assets 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes primarily foreign subsidiary and certain state minimum net worth tax for current income 
however  future improvements in operational performance could result in the increased certainty of our ability to apply our deferred tax assets against taxable income which  could in turn  result in a significant impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and our reported operating results 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in and million in the million increase from to  as well as the million increase from to is primarily due to an increase in sales of embosphere microsphere in the united sates following receipt of fda k clearance and commercial introduction in april north american revenues increased from million in to million in no product sales were recorded in north america during included in our consolidated and north american revenue was  in collaboration revenue recognized through a supply agreement with a third party 
we expect that sales of our embosphere microspheres will continue to account for a majority of our revenue in costs of products sold for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in  representing   and of product revenue  respectively 
the  increase in the cost of product revenues in the year ended december  was due to increased sales volume offset by the effects of a shift in product sales to the embosphere microsphere products which have a higher gross profit margin than our other products 
gross margin for the year ended december  was million or of product revenues compared with million or of product revenues for the same period in and  or of product revenues in the increase in gross margin for each of the years ended december  and was attributable to the effects of a shift in the majority of sales to the higher margin embosphere microsphere products  predominantly in north america 
also contributing to the gross margin improvement during and was the effect of improved manufacturing efficiencies and process improvements realized at our french production facility 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and  in the million increase from to as well as the million increase in research and development expenses from to was due primarily to clinical trial and regulatory submission costs incurred relative to seeking regulatory approval for embosphere microsphere and embogold microspheres in the united states 
the increase from to was also due to the final process development and validation costs incurred with respect to the release of our embogold microspheres product line combined with additional salary and staffing expense in the united states 
we anticipate future research and development expenses will increase as a result of the advancement of embosphere microsphere products through our pivotal phase ii clinical trial for uterine artery embolization of uterine fibroids  which was initiated in october the phase ii trial was approved by the fda under an investigational device exemption 
additional expenses are also expected to result from the continued development and enhancement of our current products and product candidates 
selling  general and administrative expenses  net of non cash  non employee stock option acceleration charges  increased to million for the year ended december  from million in and million in the million and million increases in selling  general and administrative expenses from to and from to  respectively  were primarily due to the implementation of our product commercialization plan  including salary and other related costs associated with increased personnel  sales and marketing  investor relations and all other expenses associated with developing and introducing a new product platform in both the north american and european territories 
future selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase consistent with the growth in our revenue and the embolization industry in general 
in connection with stock options previously issued to non employee advisors  we recognized  in accordance with emerging issues task force abstract accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf  million in non employee compensation expense during the year ended december  the non cash stock based compensation charge has been presented as a separate line item within the statement of operations for the year ended december  the million aggregate fair value of the non employee stock options was derived from the black scholes option pricing model 
interest income was  in the year ended december  compared to  in and  in the growth in interest income in each of the sequential years was due to the continued increase in the average daily invested cash balances offset  to a limited extent  by reduced rates of return  particularly during fiscal increased invested cash primarily resulted from the may sale of our discontinued chromatography operations resulting in net proceeds of approximately million along with the net proceeds of million  million and million from our february  july and july equity placements  respectively 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in and to  in this sequential decrease for each of and was primarily due to the retirement of our debt in the second quarter of interest expense during primarily resulted from the cost of financing operational cash flow as well as certain capital leases 
interest expense in resulted primarily from non cash interest charges generated from the potential obligation to purchase the remaining outstanding minority interest in bmsa 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements 
other income and expense increased from  in to  in  then decreased to  in other income and expense is primarily comprised of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses and to a limited extent  gains on the sale of idle assets 
the  change from to was primarily due to foreign currency losses associated with our inter company trade 
we have not recorded any tax benefit resulting from our operating losses as management believes the ability to realize and benefit against future taxable income is uncertain 
net loss from continuing operations increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in and million in the increases are a direct result of the implementation of our strategic plan to develop  introduce and commercialize our embosphere microspheres  embogold microspheres  and other product lines both in the north american and european markets 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations from product sales  net proceeds provided by public and private equity offerings  funds provided by the sale of our former chromatography business  funds provided by sepracor  bank financing  equipment financing leases and to a lesser extent  the exercise of stock options 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  an increase of million from million as of december  this increase primarily resulted from the net proceeds of million from our public offering of common stock in july offset  to a limited extent  by cash used to fund operations 
as of december   we had million in working capital 
we expect to finance our operations through product sales and existing cash balances 
for the year ended december   we used million in operating cash primarily to fund our sales  marketing  research and product development activities and to finance working capital requirements 
cash used in operations is expected to decrease over the next twelve month period as anticipated increases in product revenues are expected to offset the company s operational and product development expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and primarily represents our investment of cash in excess of current operational needs in marketable securities 
we also used  in connection with the purchase of the remaining outstanding equity interest in bmsa 
from this step acquisition  our total ownership interest in bmsa increased from to 
the remaining cash used in investing activities of approximately million was used to purchase property and equipment relating to establishing full manufacturing capabilities at bmsa and to obtain office equipment and furnishings in our corporate headquarters in rockland  massachusetts 
we anticipate future capital expenditures will increase over the next twelve month period consistent with our plan to expand our manufacturing  sales and marketing presence in the united states  europe  the far east  australia and canada 
if available on favorable terms  we expect to finance certain future fixed asset acquisitions through leasing arrangements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  on july   we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock at per share 
of the million shares of common stock offered  we sold million shares and sepracor sold million shares 
our net proceeds were approximately million 
proceeds from the public offering will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  including product commercialization and research and development 
on august   sepracor sold an additional  shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option 
as a result of this offering  including the over allotment  sepracor s beneficial ownership interest in our outstanding common stock decreased from approximately to approximately 
in both february and in july  we completed private equity placements resulting in the issuance of an aggregate of  shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
the february private equity issuance included warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
cash provided by financing activities also includes  and  received in connection with the sale of common stock through the exercise of options granted under our incentive stock option plans during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that our existing cash and other working capital  including the approximate million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we have as of december   will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital requirements  as currently planned  at least through the next twelve month period 
however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to changes in anticipated research and development efforts  the scope and results of pre clinical and clinical testing  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the timing and results of fda regulatory review  the market s acceptance of any approved products  and other factors 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  pre clinical studies  clinical trials  the expansion of our manufacturing  laboratory and administrative functions as well as costs relating to further commercialization activities 
we may also need additional funds for possible strategic acquisitions of synergistic businesses  products and or technologies 
these additional funds may be raised from time to time through additional public or private sales of equity  through borrowings  or through other financings 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional funding that may be required on acceptable terms  if at all 
borrowing arrangement in march  bmsa entered into a euro   equivalent as of december  term loan with a french national bank that is payable over five years and accrues interest at per annum 
the total loan balance outstanding as of december  was approximately euro  or  as a co borrower under sepracor s commercial bank facility  we had availability to borrow up to million through a line of credit agreement 
as a result of our july underwritten public offering  sepracor s ownership of our outstanding common stock was reduced to less than  thereby automatically terminating the co borrowing arrangement 
because we are no longer a party to the loan agreement  which had no outstanding balance as of december   the bank released sepracor s guaranty of our obligations to the bank and sepracor terminated its related security interest in our assets 
commitments as of december   we have entered into two operating leases pursuant to the lease of our facilities in rockland  massachusetts and roissy  france 
the rockland  massachusetts lease expires in march of and the roissy  france operating lease expires in may during  we entered into several non cancelable capital lease agreements with various equipment financing companies  in connection with the acquisition of certain manufacturing and computer equipment 
the leases have initial terms of to months with interest rates of to 
all corresponding leased equipment serves as pledged capital with respect to each respective capital lease agreement 
future cash payments  including interest  under contractual obligations in effect as of december   are as follows term operating capital period loans leases leases total in thousands thereafter total contractual cash commitments   related party transactions the company subcontracts a key portion of its final packaging processes to an independent third party contract manufacturer 
if such services were not available at a reasonable cost from our existing contract manufacturer  we would need to obtain new contracts with new providers or incur the expense of internalizing the packaging process 
such a conversion could cause us to incur additional expense in validating the process under fda good manufacturing practices  delay the availability of finished product and limit commercial sales of our products 
receivable from related party represents the portion of offering expenses that sepracor has agreed to pay as a result of sepracor s participation in the july public offering of million shares of our common stock 
total related party receivables are offset by amounts due to sepracor for certain administrative services provided to us on an arms length basis by sepracor as of december  total administrative fees charged for services rendered in the year ended december  were not material 
all receivable from related party balances were received in full in february sepracor is entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration under the securities act of a total of  shares of our common stock 
these rights provide that sepracor may require us to register shares  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
as of december   sepracor has not exercised these rights 
as of december   the company is not a party to any unconsolidated special purpose entity arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in  statement of financial accounting standards or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize million of goodwill 
during  we recorded approximately  of amortization within selling  general and administrative expense and would have recorded an estimated  of amortization during in lieu of periodic amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review over the next six month period 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments as of december   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standard no 
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the area of foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our operations in france 
operations in france are denominated in the euro 
we have not engaged in formal currency hedging activities to date  but do have a limited natural hedge in that our expenses in france are primarily denominated in local currency  and we also attempt to minimize exchange rate risk by converting non us currency to non us dollars as often as practicable 
we generally view our investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than our reporting currency as long term 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the other accumulated comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity 
a ten percent depreciation in year end and functional currencies relative to the us dollar would not result in a material reduction of stockholders equity 
because our foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material  no quantitative tabular disclosure has been provided
