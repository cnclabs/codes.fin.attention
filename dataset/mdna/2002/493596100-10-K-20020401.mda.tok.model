the company has adopted these clarifications as of january  and has retroactively restated ffo for as presented in the tables below 
management believes the presentation of ffo and funds available for distribution fad are useful disclosures as general measures of its performance in the real estate industry  although the company s ffo and fad may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of performance for other reits 
ffo and fad do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity

inflation the company s leases for commercial office and industrial properties generally require tenants to pay either their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance or pay of these costs directly for triple net leases  as a result  the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses is reduced

critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company assesses its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a respective asset that the company expects to hold and use may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized 
while the company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect its evaluations 
estimates of fair value are based on quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are not available  the best information available in the circumstances  such as the present value of estimated expected future cash flows 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that were not previously recorded 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is derived from rental income under leases that are classified as operating leases 
revenue is recognized on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
if the rental income under the lease is in excess of one year in length  it is recognized using the straight line method under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term 
reimbursements from tenants for expenses are accrued as revenue in the same period the related expenses are incurred by the company 
deferred rent revenue represents rent collected from tenants in advance  which is generally for periods not longer than one year 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when amounts are earned under the terms of the company s leases with its tenants 
impact of recent accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements

the weighted average interest rate and maturity for fixed rate debt was and years  respectively  at december  as these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
the following table summarizes the company s five year debt maturities at december  and the weighted average interest rates associated with the maturing debt in each respective year  excluding the impact of any debt premiums which were initially recorded 
maturing debt in s      weighted average interest rate includes the credit facility which had an outstanding balance of million at december  and matures december  if the interest rate for the credit facility and other variable rate debt was basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense would have been increased or decreased by approximately  approximately million of the company s debt  including approximately million of fixed rate debt which has a weighted average interest rate of  matures in the company currently intends to refinance these maturing obligations in if interest rates for this million of fixed rate debt maturing and to be refinanced in are basis points higher or lower than the current rate of  the company s interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  due to the uncertainty of fluctuations in interest rates  the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
as of december   the company does not have any derivative investments related to interest rate management
