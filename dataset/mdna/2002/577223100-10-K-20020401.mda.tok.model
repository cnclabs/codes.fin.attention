item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
in addition to historical information  the discussion in this document contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock and elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a leading supplier of semiconductor wafer processing equipment used in front end fabrication of integrated circuits 
our products include dry strip equipment  rapid thermal processing rtp equipment  wet surface preparation equipment  and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition pecvd equipment 
our integrated circuit manufacturing equipment utilizes innovative technology to deliver advanced processing capability and high productivity 
we provide our customers with worldwide support through our international technical support organization  and our comprehensive warranty program 
our business depends upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices 
the semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a severe downturn  which has resulted in drastic capital spending cutbacks by our customers 
semiconductor companies continue to reevaluate their capital spending  postpone their new purchase decisions  and reschedule or cancel existing orders 
declines in demand for semiconductors deepened throughout each sequential quarter of in contrast  the semiconductor industry had one of its best years ever in the cyclicality and uncertainties regarding overall market conditions continue to present significant challenges to us and impair our ability to forecast near term revenue 
our ability to quickly modify our operations in response to changes in market conditions is limited 
in order to support longer term needs for our products  we have continued to increase research and development expenses from previous years 
we are dependent upon increases in sales in order to attain profitability 
if our sales do not increase  our current operating expenses could prevent us from attaining profitability and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
on january   we acquired the semiconductor equipment division of steag electronic systems ag the steag semiconductor division  which consisted of a number of entities that became our direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries 
at the same time  we acquired cfm technologies  inc cfm 
we refer to these simultaneous acquisitions as the merger 
the merger substantially changed the size of our company and the nature and breadth of our product lines 
the steag semiconductor division was a leading supplier of rtp equipment  and both the steag semiconductor division and cfm were suppliers of wet surface preparation equipment 
until  prior to the merger  we derived a substantial majority of our sales from our aspen dry strip systems  with our remaining sales derived primarily from cvd systems  as well as spare parts and maintenance services 
in  sales of our aspen dry strip system and cvd systems comprised and of our net sales  respectively 
in  after the merger  dry strip  rtp  and wet surface preparation systems sales accounted for   and of our net sales  respectively 
the merger affects the comparability of our results from to our results in prior years 
at the time we completed the merger  our industry was entering an economic slowdown 
the merger more than doubled the size of our company  and we faced a number of challenges in integrating the merged companies 
during  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
the acquired businesses had excess production capacity at the time of merger  and this excess production capacity was exacerbated by the economic slowdown 
during  in light of our business levels and assessment of the carrying value of our long lived assets  we took charges totaling approximately million due to the impairment of goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets we acquired in the merger 
the merger also had an adverse effect on our gross margins for fiscal our excess production capacity was a large factor affecting our margins  especially during the later quarters of the year 
as a result of the economic slowdown  we took inventory valuation reserves of approximately million during the year  which were recorded as cost of goods sold 
international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe  japan and the pacific rim  including taiwan  singapore and korea  accounted for of total net sales for  of total net sales for and of total net sales for we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales 
we have substantial research  development and manufacturing facilities in the united states and germany  and we have sales and service facilities in a number of countries around the world 
the local currency is the functional currency for our foreign operations 
gains or losses from translation of foreign operations are included as a component of stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in the statement of operations and have not been material to date 
the transactions that were part of the merger have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in our acquisition of the steag semiconductor division  we issued  shares of our common stock to steag electronic systems ag ses 
this stock was valued at approximately million for purchase accounting purposes 
we also assumed certain obligations  certain intercompany indebtedness and contractual payment obligations owed by the acquired subsidiaries to ses 
as a result  at the end of we had approximately million in debt obligations to ses  including accrued interest at  due july  in our acquisition of cfm  we issued  shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of cfm 
this stock was valued at approximately million for purchase accounting purposes 
in addition  we issued options to acquire  shares of our common stock upon our assumption of outstanding options to purchase cfm common stock 
these options were valued at approximately million for purchase accounting purposes 
during  in light of our business levels and assessment of the carrying value of all long lived assets  we took charges totaling million due to the impairment of goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets that we acquired in the merger and charges of million for facilities lease losses for idle facilities 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to inventories  warranty obligations  customer incentives  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  warranty obligations  inventories  and impairment of long lived assets as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab we derive revenue from two primary sources equipment sales and spare part sales 
we account for equipment sales as follows for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications or acceptance clauses or to a new customer  for all sales of new products  and for all sales of our wet surface preparation products  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  for equipment sales to existing customers  who have purchased the same equipment with the same specifications and previously demonstrated acceptance provisions  the lesser of the fair value of the equipment or the contractual amount billable upon shipment is recorded as revenue upon title transfer 
the remainder is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance 
from time to time  however  we allow customers to evaluate systems  and since customers can return such systems at any time with limited or no penalty  we do not recognize revenue until these evaluation systems are accepted by the customer 
revenues associated with sales to customers in japan are recognized upon customer acceptance  with the exception of sales of our rtp products through our distributor in japan  where revenues are recognized upon title transfer to the distributor 
for spare parts  revenue is recognized upon shipment service and maintenance contract revenue  which to date has been insignificant  is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
revenues are difficult to predict  due in part to our reliance on customer acceptance related to a significant number of our shipments 
any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
warranty 
our warranties require us to repair or replace defective product or parts  generally at a customer s site  during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
the warranty offered on our systems ranges from months to months depending on the product 
we have  as part of certain sales agreements  offered extended warranties on some products that generally extend the standard warranty period by up to one year 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded as a cost of sales based on our historical costs at the time of revenue recognition 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot be certain that we will continue to experience the same warranty repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in the costs to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such additional costs materialize 
inventories 
due to the changing market conditions  recent economic downturn and estimated future requirements  inventory valuation charges of approximately million were recorded in the second half of this reserve largely covers inventories for thermal and omni products that were acquired in the merger with the steag semiconductor division and cfm 
given the downturn in the semiconductor industry  the age of the inventories on hand and the introduction of new products  we wrote down excess inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and obsolete inventories that are no longer used in current production 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such difference may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we attempt to accurately forecast future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
as of december   there was an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory of approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identified intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on changes in strategy  market conditions and operational performance of our business 
future events  including significant negative industry or economic trends  could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that long lived assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding fiscal impairment charges 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data for the periods indicated  expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales inventory valuation charges gross margin operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative in process research and development amortization of goodwill and intangibles impairment of long lived assets and other charges income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision benefit for income taxes net income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  compared to net sales of million for the year ended december  we estimate that on a pro forma basis for the year ended december   assuming that we had acquired the steag semiconductor division and cfm on january   the combined company would have had net sales of million  so that net sales in the year would reflect a decrease of from net sales decreased in primarily due to the economic downturn in the semiconductor industry and also due to the timing effects of revenue recognition  where the time lag between product shipment and customer acceptance can exceed one year 
a significant proportion of products shipped during fiscal and from our thermal and wet product divisions operations acquired from the steag semiconductor division and cfm resulted in deferred revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  due to the complexities of the equipment shipped and the associated acceptance clauses 
our total deferred revenue at december  was approximately million 
we expect deferred revenue to be recognized as revenue in our consolidated statement of operations in the next six to twelve months 
under the rules of the purchase method of accounting  deferred revenue relating to sales by the acquired operations are generally not carried over through the acquisition 
as a result  it will take several quarters of combined operations before our net sales results normalize and can be compared across reporting periods 
gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended december  was  a decrease from gross margin of for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin in was due to several factors 
our costs were adversely affected by the under absorption of our production facilities  leading to manufacturing overhead inefficiencies 
we currently have excess production capacity as a result of the drop in sales and bookings combined with our acquisition of additional production capacity in germany and exton  pa as a result of the merger 
our gross margin in was also adversely affected by the write up of inventory acquired in the merger to fair value  as required by accounting principles board opinion no 
business combinations  in the amount of million  or percent of net sales 
the effect of this write up is expected to continue  to a lesser extent  in future quarters as this inventory acquired in the merger is sold and recorded as cost of sales 
in addition  our gross margin in was adversely affected by increased provisions for excess inventories that we do not believe will be realized based on our current bookings or forecasted levels of sales  in the amount of million  or percent of net sales 
this provision largely covers inventories for rtp and wet products that were acquired in the merger 
we are also facing pricing pressure from competitors that is affecting our gross margin 
our gross margin has varied over the years and will continue to vary based on multiple factors including  competitive pressures  our product mix  economies of scale  overhead absorption levels  and costs associated with the introduction of new products 
our gross margin on international sales  other than sales to canon  our distributor in japan for rtp products  have been substantially the same as domestic sales 
sales to canon typically carry a lower gross margin  as canon is primarily responsible for rtp sales and support costs in japan 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses were million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars in was due to additional personnel and spending resulting from the merger 
the increase in research  development and engineering expense as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to decreased sales in during  major efforts were made with regard to the improvement of our current product line of mm tools and the processes they are capable of running 
improvement of the reliability of the tools was a focal point for engineering in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars in was due to additional personnel and spending added by the merger 
also in  the company incurred million of severance charges and million bad debt charges recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to decreased net sales in and the severance charge 
in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of the steag semiconductor division  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows relating to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was expensed as of the acquisition date 
at the acquisition date  the steag semiconductor division was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of the hybrid tool and the single wafer tool 
the projects under development at the valuation date represent next generation technologies that are expected to address emerging market demands for wet processing equipment 
at the acquisition date  the technologies under development were approximately percent complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
the steag semiconductor division had spent approximately million on the in process projects  and expected to spend approximately an additional million to complete all phases of the r d 
anticipated completion dates ranged from to months  at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technologies 
in making our purchase price allocation  we considered present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items  an assessment of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
aggregate revenues for the developmental steag semiconductor division products were estimated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately percent for the seven years following introduction  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d programs 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak within five years of acquisition and then decline sharply as other new products and technologies were expected to enter the market 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on estimated cost of capital calculations 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects  a discount rate of percent was used to value the in process r d 
this discount rate was commensurate with the steag semiconductor division stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
in connection with the acquisition of cfm  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to an in process research and development project 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to one incomplete research and development project 
at the date of acquisition  the development of this project had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was expensed as of the acquisition date 
at the acquisition date  cfm was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of the odi ozonated water module 
the project under development at the valuation date represents next generation technology that is expected to address emerging market demands for more effective  lower cost  and safer resist and oxide removal processes 
at the acquisition date  the technology under development was approximately percent complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
cfm had spent approximately million on the in process project  and expected to spend approximately an additional  to complete all phases of the research and development 
anticipated completion dates ranged from to months  at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technology 
in making our purchase price allocation  we considered present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items  an assessment of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into a commercially viable product  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the project  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from the project is based on management s estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
aggregate revenues for the developmental cfm product were estimated for the five to seven years following introduction  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major research and development programs 
the estimated revenues for the in process project was expected to peak within two years of acquisition and then decline sharply as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on estimated cost of capital calculations 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental project  a discount rate of percent was used to value the in process research and development 
this discount rate was commensurate with cfm s stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
if these projects are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the combined company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other acquired intangible assets may become impaired 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
goodwill and intangibles represent the purchase price of the steag semiconductor division and cfm in excess of identified tangible assets 
in connection with the merger  effective january   we recorded million of goodwill and intangible assets  which were being amortized on a straight line basis over three to seven years 
we recorded amortization expense of million for the year upon adoption of sfas on january   we will no longer amortize goodwill 
we will continue to amortize the identified intangibles  in an amount estimated to be million for impairment of long lived assets and other charges 
in the third and fourth quarters of  an independent third party performed assessments of the carrying values of our long lived assets to be held and used including goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment recorded in connection with our acquisitions of the steag semiconductor division and cfm 
the assessment was performed pursuant to sfas no 
as a result of deteriorated market conditions in the semiconductor industry in general  a reduced demand specifically for the rtp products and certain wet products acquired in the merger  and revised projected cash flows for these products in the future 
as a result of these assessments  we recorded a charge of million to reduce goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment based on the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded their fair value 
fair value was determined based on discounted future cash flows 
interest and other income  net 
interest expense of million was primarily related to interest on our notes payable to ses 
interest income of million resulted from the investment of our cash balances during the year 
we also had other income of million which included losses on sales of fixed assets of million and the remainder was due to foreign exchange gains 
for the year ended december   we earned interest income of million which was from the investment of the net proceeds from the sale of common stock in march provision for income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  compared to a tax provision of million for the year ended december  the tax benefit recorded in  resulted from the release of the deferred tax liability recorded in conjunction with the purchase of the steag semiconductor division and cfm 
fasb statement no 
requires that a deferred tax liability be recorded to offset the tax impact of non deductible identifiable intangible assets recorded as part of purchase accounting 
the deferred tax liability decreases proportionally to any amortization or write down of the identifiable intangibles 
we recognized a provision for income taxes at an effective tax rate of during  as we were able to recognize certain benefits from our prior operating losses 
fasb statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon available data  which includes our historical operating performance  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset at december   as the future realization of the tax benefit is not sufficiently assured 
we intend to evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  over net sales of million for the year ended december  net sales of million in reflect the company s adoption of sab net sales increased in primarily as a result of a increase in unit shipments and a increase in average selling prices that was attributable to semiconductor manufacturers need for additional capacity and new technology 
gross margin 
gross profit under the adoption of sab was million for the year ended december   representing of net sales  up from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  under the historical shipment method of recognizing revenue 
our cost of sales includes labor  materials and overhead 
gross margin increased in primarily due to favorable manufacturing overhead efficiencies  as the number of systems shipped increased in compared to research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses were million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to compensation and related benefits  which increased to million in from million in  and engineering materials expense  which increased to million in from million in the increase in compensation and related benefits expense was due to increased personnel required to support our anticipated long term future growth 
the decrease in research  development and engineering expense as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to increased sales in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to compensation and related benefits  which increased to million in from million in due to increased personnel during  outside services expense  which increased to million in from million in  professional fees  which increased to million in from million in  travel expense  which increased to million in from million in  building and utility expense  which increased to million in from million in  and advertisement expense  which increased to million in from million in  all due to our growth 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to increased net sales in provision for income taxes 
we recorded a tax provision of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  we recognized provision for income taxes at an effective tax rate of during  as we were able to recognize certain benefits from our prior operating losses 
in we did not recognize any tax benefits from our operating losses and the tax provision primarily relates to foreign income tax 
fasb statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon available data  which includes our historical operating performance  we provided a million valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets at december   as the future realization of the tax benefit was not sufficiently assured 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth our unaudited consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarterly periods ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we have prepared this unaudited consolidated information on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements  reflecting all normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for the quarters presented

net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  which consisted of the sale of million of investments and cash acquired from the acquisition of steag and cfm of million offset by the purchase of million of property and equipment and million of investments 
net cash used in investing activities in was million which consisted of the purchase of million of investments and million of property and equipment offset by the sale of million of investments 
net cash provided by investing activities in included the collection of a million note receivable from our then chief executive officer  and the sale of million of short term investments  offset by the purchase of million of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily from million borrowings against lines of credit  million proceeds from stock plans and million of interest accrued on the notes payable to ses  offset by the repayment of million against our line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily from million net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and million proceeds from stock plans  offset by the repayment of million against our line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily from the million net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and our stock option plan and borrowings of million against our million line of credit 
as a result of our acquisition of the steag semiconductor division at the beginning of  we owe ses a total of approximately million under two promissory notes which bear interest at per year and are due july  one promissory note  in the amount of million  is secured by an irrevocable standby letter of credit issued by silicon valley bank  which is in turn secured by restricted cash on our balance sheet in the amount of million 
this obligation had originally been due on july  on november   ses agreed to extend the maturity date to july   and the interest accrued through july  was capitalized and added to the principal under the extended note 
the note contains certain covenants  and we have been in compliance with them 
the second promissory note  in the amount of million euro approximately million  is secured by the accounts receivable of two of our acquired subsidiaries  mattson thermal products gmbh  dornstadt  germany  and mattson wet products gmbh  pliezhausen  germany 
this note contains covenants and requires us to maintain certain balances  including a minimum amount of applicable accounts receivable of at least million euro approximately million at our relevant subsidiaries 
we have been in compliance with all of these covenants 
as of december   we have non cancelable operating lease commitments of million 
we have made loans to certain current and former executive officers  in an aggregate amount of approximately  these loans are described in the section captioned certain relationships and related transactions 
our japanese subsidiary has entered into a credit line with bank of tokyo mitsubishi in the amount of million yen approximately million  secured by trade accounts receivable 
the line bears interest at a per annum rate of tibor plus basis points  which is approximately at december  the term of the line is through june  we have guaranteed the line 
at december   the borrowing on this line was million yen approximately million 
during  one of the subsidiaries we acquired as part of the steag semiconductor division entered into a two year revolving line of credit with a bank in japan in the amount of million yen approximately million  under which million yen approximately million was borrowed 
it bore interest at a per annum rate of through march and thereafter at a rate of  and was secured by a letter of credit in the amount of million  which required us to maintain a restricted cash balance in the same amount 
these borrowings were repaid in full in december  and the line of credit was cancelled 
this resulted in an increase in our unrestricted cash by approximately million 
on march  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock 
the public offering price was per share 
on march   the underwriters exercised a right to purchase an additional  shares to cover over allotments 
the net proceeds of approximately million were raised for general corporate purposes  principally working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
on march  we entered into a one year revolving line of credit with a bank in the amount of million 
the line of credit will expire on march   if not extended by then 
all borrowings under this line will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus basis points 
the line of credit is secured by a blanket lien on all domestic assets including intellectual property 
the line of credit requires the company to satisfy certain quarterly financial covenants  including maintaining a minimum quick ratio  minimum tangible net worth and meeting minimum revenue targets 
based on current projections  we believe that our current cash and investment positions will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our primary source of liquidity is our existing unrestricted cash balance and cash generated by our operations 
during  we had operating losses  and used net cash in our operating activities 
our operating plans are based on and require that we reduce our operating losses  control our expenses  manage our inventories  and collect our accounts receivable balances 
in this market downturn  we are exposed to a number of challenges and risks  including delays in payments of our accounts receivable by our customers  and postponements or cancellations of orders 
postponed or cancelled orders can cause us to have excess inventory and underutilized manufacturing capacity 
if we are not able to significantly reduce our present operating losses over the upcoming quarters  our operating losses could adversely affect our cash and working capital balances  and we may be required to seek additional sources of financing 
we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financing  or other sources  to fund our operations 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing when needed 
failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced  and these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants on our operations and financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements on june   the financial accounting standard board fasb approved for issuance sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
major provisions of these statements are as follows all business combinations initiated after june  must use the purchase method of accounting  the pooling of interest method of accounting is prohibited except for transactions initiated before july   intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recorded separately from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights or are separable from the acquired entity and can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or as part of a related contract  asset or liability  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually using a fair value approach  except in certain circumstances  and whenever there is an impairment indicator  other intangible assets will continue to be valued and amortized over their estimated lives  in process research and development will continue to be written off immediately  all acquired goodwill must be assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing and segment reporting  effective january   existing goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be subject to amortization 
goodwill arising between july  and december  will not be subject to amortization 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 on january   the company no longer amortizes goodwill  thereby eliminating annual goodwill amortization of approximately million  based on anticipated amortization for the company will continue to amortize the identified intangibles  which is estimated to be million for amortization of goodwill and intangibles for the year ended december  was approximately million including amounts related to the amortization of goodwill and intangibles of cfm and the steag semiconductor division which became impaired 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas 
sfas addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period while the cost is depreciated over its useful life 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas  which replaces sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires long lived assets to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell 
sfas also broadens disposal transactions reporting related to discontinued operations 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
mergers and acquisitions on june   we entered into a definitive strategic business combination agreement  subsequently amended on december  and november  combination agreement to acquire eleven direct and indirect subsidiaries comprising the semiconductor equipment division of steag electronic systems ag the steag semiconductor division  and we entered into an agreement and plan of merger plan of merger to acquire cfm technologies  inc cfm 
both transactions were completed simultaneously on january  under the combination agreement  we issued to steag electronic systems ag ses  shares of common stock  valued at approximately million as of the date of the amended combination agreement 
we also paid ses  in cash  assumed certain obligations of ses and steag ag  the parent company of ses  and assumed certain intercompany indebtedness and obligations owed by the acquired subsidiaries to ses 
we reimbursed ses million in acquisition related costs in april at december   we owed ses approximately million including accrued interest  under two secured promissory notes 
one note is in the principal amount of million  and the other is in the principal amount of million euros approximately million as of december  
each note bears interest at per annum  and is due july  the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and the results of operations of the steag semiconductor division are included in our condensed consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price of this acquisition was million  which included million of direct acquisition related costs including the amount reimbursed to ses 
under the plan of merger with cfm  we agreed to acquire cfm in a stock for stock merger in which we issued  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million 
in addition  we assumed all outstanding cfm stock options  which resulted in our issuance of options to acquire  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million 
the merger has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations of cfm are included in our consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price of the acquisition of cfm was million  which included million of direct acquisition related costs 
under the combination agreement and the plan of merger  we also agreed to grant options to purchase  shares of our common stock to employees of the steag semiconductor division and options to purchase  shares of our common stock to employees of cfm subsequent to the closing of the transactions 
these options are not included in the purchase price of the steag semiconductor division or cfm 
as a result of our acquisition of the steag semiconductor division  ses holds approximately of our common stock and currently has two representatives on our board of directors 
as part of the acquisition  we entered into several transition services agreements with ses  under which ses agreed to provide specified payroll  communications  accounting information and intellectual property administration services to certain of our german subsidiaries for a term of one year 
in  we paid to ses approximately  in connection with the purchase of services or supplies pursuant to the transition services agreements 
in addition  we have a manufacturing supply contract with a company affiliated with ses  under which we had the right to utilize manufacturing and assembly services based on an hourly rate 
for  we purchased million worth of such manufacturing and assembly services 
in february  we announced plans to divest our single wafer rt cvd business unit  previously known as steag cvd systems 
the business unit  which was acquired as part of the steag semiconductor division  included lamp based rt cvd tools that did not fit with our strategic roadmap for thermal and cvd products 
in april  we acquired of the outstanding shares of rf services  inc for a cash price of  including acquisition related costs of 
brad mattson  former chief executive officer of the company  owned a majority of the outstanding shares of rf services  inc and served as a director of that company 
risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock the semiconductor equipment industry is cyclical  is currently experiencing a severe and prolonged downturn  and causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns  whether the result of general economic changes or capacity growth temporarily exceeding growth in demand for semiconductor devices 
during periods of declining demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  customers typically reduce purchases  delay delivery of products and or cancel orders 
increased price competition may result  causing pressure on our net sales  gross margin and net income 
we are experiencing cancellations  delays and push outs of orders  which reduce our revenues  cause delays in our ability to recognize revenue on the orders and reduce backlog 
further order cancellations  reductions in order size or delays in orders will materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
following the very strong year in  the semiconductor industry is now in the midst of a significant and prolonged downturn  and we and other industry participants are experiencing lower bookings  significant push outs and cancellations of orders 
the severity and duration of the downturn are unknown  but is impairing our ability to sell our systems and to operate profitably 
if demand for semiconductor devices and our systems remains depressed for an extended period  it will seriously harm our business 
as a result of the acquisition of the steag semiconductor division and cfm at the beginning of  we are a larger  more geographically diverse company  less able to react quickly to the cyclicality of the semiconductor business  particularly in europe and other regions where restrictive laws relating to termination of employees prohibit us from quickly reducing costs in order to meet the downturn 
accordingly  during this latest downturn we have been unable to reduce our expenses quickly enough to avoid incurring a loss 
for the fiscal year ended december   our net loss was million  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the net loss in reflected the impact of our decline in net sales  and unusual charges of million  including impairment charges  effects of apb inventory charges  inventory valuation charges and write downs  restructuring costs and in process research and development write offs 
if our actions to date are insufficient to effectively align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions  we may be required to undertake additional cost cutting measures  and may be unable to continue to invest in marketing  research and development and engineering at the levels we believe are necessary to maintain our competitive position 
our failure to make these investments could seriously harm our long term business prospects 
we are exposed to the risks associated with industry overcapacity  including reduced capital expenditures  decreased demand for our products and the inability of many of our customers to pay for our products 
as a result of the recent economic downturn  inventory buildups in telecommunication products and slower than expected personal computer sales have resulted in overcapacity of semiconductor devices and has caused semiconductor manufacturers to experience cash flow problems and reduce their capital spending 
as our business depends in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices  including manufacturers that open new or expand existing facilities  continued overcapacity and reductions in capital expenditures by our customers could cause further delays or decreased demand for our products 
if existing fabrication facilities are not expanded or new facilities are not built  demand for our systems may not develop or increase  and we may be unable to generate significant new orders for our systems 
if we are unable to develop new orders for our systems  we will not achieve anticipated net sales levels 
in addition  many semiconductor manufacturers are continuing to forecast that revenues in the short term will remain flat or lower than in previous high demand years  and we believe that some customers may experience cash flow problems 
as a result  if customers are not successful generating sufficient revenue or securing alternative financing arrangements  we may be unable to close sales or collect accounts receivables from such customers or potential customers  and may be required to take additional reserves against our accounts receivables 
the merger with steag and cfm may fail to achieve beneficial synergies and we may be unable to efficiently integrate the operations of our acquisitions 
we entered into the merger transaction with the expectation that it would result in beneficial synergies between and among the semiconductor equipment businesses of the three combined companies 
achieving these anticipated synergies and their potential benefits would depend on a number of factors  some of which include our ability to timely develop new products and integrate the products and sales efforts of the combined company  and competitive conditions and cyclicality in the semiconductor manufacturing process equipment market 
if we are able to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions  the operations of steag and cfm must be integrated and combined efficiently 
although we have commenced these integration activities  the process of integrating supply and distribution channels  computer and accounting systems and other aspects of operations  while managing a larger entity  has presented and is expected to continue to present a significant challenge to our management 
in addition  we have incurred substantial restructuring costs in order to achieve desired synergies of the transactions  including severance costs associated with headcount reductions due to duplication  and asset write offs associated with manufacturing and facility consolidations 
we may incur additional costs associated with improving existing and implementing new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls to fully integrate the three businesses 
the dedication of management resources to the integration has detracted  and may continue to detract  attention from the day to day business 
the difficulties of integration are increased by the necessity of combining personnel with disparate business backgrounds  combining different corporate cultures and utilizing incompatible financial systems 
we may incur additional costs associated with these activities  which could materially reduce our short term earnings 
even with the integrated operations  there can be no assurance that the anticipated synergies will be achieved 
the failure to achieve such synergies could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we will need to improve or implement new systems  procedures and controls 
the integration of steag and cfm and their operational and financial systems and controls has placed a significant strain on our management information systems and our administrative  operational and financial resources 
to efficiently manage the combined company  we must improve our existing and implement new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
since the merger  we have commenced integration of the businesses  systems and controls of the three companies  however  each business has historically used a different financial system  and the resulting integration and consolidation has placed and will continue to place substantial demands on our management resources 
improving or implementing new systems  procedures and controls may be costly  and may place further burdens on our management and internal resources 
if we are unable to improve our existing or implement new systems  procedures and controls in a timely manner  our business could be seriously harmed 
our results of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventory 
to achieve commercial success with our product lines  we will need to manage our inventory of component parts and finished goods effectively to meet changing customer requirements 
some of our products and supplies have in the past and may in the future become obsolete while in inventory due to rapidly changing customer specifications 
for example  in the quarters ended september  and december   we took inventory valuation charges of million 
if we are not successfully able to manage our inventory  including our spare parts inventory  we may need to write off unsaleable or obsolete inventory  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
warranty claims in excess of our projections could seriously harm our business 
we offer a warranty on our products 
the cost associated with our warranty is significant  and in the event our projections and estimates of this cost are inaccurate our financial performance could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if we experienced product failures at an unexpectedly high level  our reputation in the marketplace could be damaged and our business would suffer 
we may need additional capital  which may not be available and which could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
based on current projections  we believe that our current cash and investments along with cash generated through operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months 
management s projections are based on our ability to manage inventories and collect accounts receivable balances in this market downturn 
if we are unable to manage our inventories or accounts receivable balances  or if we otherwise experience higher operating costs or lower revenue than we anticipate  then we may be required to seek alternative sources of financing 
we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financing or other sources to fund our operations 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing when needed 
if we fail to raise capital when needed  we would be unable to continue operating our business as we plan  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  any future equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
furthermore  debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants on our operations 
if we are unable to repay amounts due to steag in july  our business could be harmed 
in connection with our acquisition of the steag electronics division  we assumed certain obligations to steag electronic systems ag ses  including certain intercompany indebtedness owed by the acquired subsidiaries to ses  in exchange for a secured promissory note in the principal amount of million  with an interest rate of 
this note is secured by restricted cash in the amount of million 
we are also obligated to pay ses approximately euro million approximately million as of december  under a second promissory note  which is secured by accounts receivable of two of our subsidiaries in germany 
as this second note is payable in euros  we have exposure for exchange rate volatility 
under both of these obligations  including accrued interest  we owe approximately million as of december  to ses  which is due on july  at the due date  we will be required to repay these obligations in full 
if we are unable to repay the amounts due on the due date  steag could foreclose on the loans  resulting in significant harm to our business and financial condition 
our financial reporting may be delayed and our business may be harmed if our independent public accountant  arthur andersen llp  is unable to perform required services 
on march   our independent public accounting firm  arthur andersen llp  was indicted for alleged obstruction of justice arising from the federal government s investigation of enron corporation 
arthur andersen pleaded not guilty to the charges  and indicated that it intends to defend itself vigorously 
as a public company  we are required to file with the sec periodic financial statements audited or reviewed by an independent  certified public accountant 
the sec has announced that it will continue accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen  and interim financial statements reviewed by it  so long as arthur andersen is able to make certain representations to its clients 
our ability to make timely sec filings could be impaired if the sec ceases accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen  if arthur andersen becomes unable to make required representations to us or if for any other reason arthur andersen is unable to perform required audit related services for us in a timely manner 
this in turn could damage or delay our access to the capital markets  and could be disruptive to our operations and affect the price and liquidity of our securities 
certain investors  including significant mutual funds and institutional investors  may choose not to hold or invest in securities of issuers that do not have current financial reports available 
in such a case  we would promptly seek to engage other independent public accountants or take such other actions as may be necessary to enable us to timely file required financial reports 
in addition  relief that may otherwise be available to shareholders under the federal securities laws against auditing firms may not be available as a practical matter against arthur andersen should it cease to operate or become financially impaired 
new accounting guidance under sab has resulted in delayed recognition of our revenue 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
among other things  sab has resulted in a change from the established practice of recognizing revenue at the time of shipment of a system  and instead delaying revenue recognition in part or totally until the time of customer acceptance 
we adopted sab effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal  retroactive to january   with the impact recorded as a cumulative effect in the first quarter of in some situations  application of this accounting guidance delays the recognition of revenue that would otherwise have been recognized in earlier periods 
as a result  our reported revenue may fluctuate more widely and reported revenue for a particular fiscal period might not meet the expectations of financial analysts or investors 
a delay in recognition of revenue resulting from application of this guidance  while not affecting our cash flow  could adversely affect our results of operations  which could cause the value of our common stock to fall 
we depend on large purchases from a few customers  and any loss  cancellation  reduction or delay in purchases by  or failure to collect receivables from  these customers could harm our business 
currently  we derive most of our revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems to a relatively small number of customers  which makes our relationship with each customer critical to our business 
the list prices on our systems range from  to over million 
our lengthy sales cycle for each system  coupled with customers capital budget considerations  make the timing of customer orders uneven and difficult to predict 
in addition  our backlog at the beginning of a quarter is not expected to include all orders required to achieve our sales objectives for that quarter 
as a result  our net sales and operating results for a quarter depend on our ability to ship orders as scheduled during that quarter as well as obtain new orders for systems to be shipped in that same quarter 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced lower bookings  significant push outs and cancellation of orders 
any delay in scheduled shipments or in acceptances of shipped products would delay our ability to recognize revenue  collect outstanding accounts receivable  and would materially adversely affect our operating results for that quarter 
a delay in a shipment or customer acceptance near the end of a quarter may cause net sales in that quarter to fall below our expectations and the expectations of market analysts or investors 
if we are unable to collect a receivable from a large customer  our financial results will be negatively impacted 
our list of major customers changes substantially from year to year  and we cannot predict whether a major customer in one year will make significant purchases from us in future years 
accordingly  it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results from year to year 
if we are unable to collect a receivable from a large customer  our financial results will be negatively impacted 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict  and may fall short of anticipated levels  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results 
this fluctuation is due to a number of factors  including o cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  o delays  cancellations and push outs of orders by our customers  o delayed payments of invoices by our customers  o size and timing of sales and shipments of our products  o entry of new competitors into our market  or the announcement of new products or product enhancements by competitors  o sudden changes in component prices or availability  o variability in the mix of products sold  o manufacturing inefficiencies caused by uneven or unpredictable order patterns  reducing our gross margins  o higher fixed costs due to increased levels of research and development or patent litigation costs  and o successful expansion of our worldwide sales and marketing organization 
a substantial percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues 
as a result  any delay in generating or recognizing revenues could cause our operating results to be below the expectations of market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we incurred net operating losses for the fiscal years  and we may not achieve or maintain profitability on an annual basis  and if we do not  we may not utilize deferred tax assets 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  we expect to continue to incur significant research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses and may not return to profitability in we will need to generate significant increases in net sales to achieve and maintain profitability on an annual basis  and we may not be able to do so 
our ability to realize our deferred tax assets in future periods will depend on our ability to achieve and maintain profitability on an annual basis 
as a result of the industry downturn  we have implemented a restructuring and workforce reductions  which may adversely affect the morale and performance of our personnel and our ability to hire new personnel 
in connection with our efforts to streamline operations  reduce costs and bring our staffing and structure in line with current demand for our products  we recently restructured our organization and reduced our workforce by full time positions and consultant positions in we have incurred costs of million associated with the workforce reduction related to severance and other employee related costs in  and may incur further costs if additional restructuring is needed to right size our business further or bring our costs down to respond to continued industry and economic slowdowns 
our restructuring may also yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce and loss of employee morale and decreased performance 
in addition  the recent trading levels of our common stock have decreased the value of our stock options granted to employees pursuant to our stock option plan 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek employment with larger  more established companies or companies they perceive as having less volatile stock prices 
continuity of personnel can be an important factor in the successful sales of our products and completion of our development projects  and ongoing turnover in our sales and research and development personnel could materially and adversely impact our sales  development and marketing efforts 
we believe that hiring and retaining qualified individuals at all levels is essential to our success  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the necessary personnel 
our lengthy sales cycle increases our costs and reduces the predictability of our revenue 
sales of our systems depend upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase or replace manufacturing capacity  typically involving a significant capital commitment 
accordingly  the decision to purchase our systems requires time consuming internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation  and introduction of new technologies into our customers manufacturing facilities 
potential new customers evaluate the need to acquire new semiconductor manufacturing equipment infrequently 
even after the customer determines that our systems meet their qualification criteria  we experience delays finalizing system sales while the customer obtains approval for the purchase and constructs new facilities or expands its existing facilities 
we may expend significant sales and marketing expenses during this evaluation period 
the time between our first contact with a customer regarding a specific potential purchase and the customer s placing its first order may last from nine to twelve months or longer 
in this difficult economic climate  the average sales cycle has lengthened even further and is expected to continue to make it difficult to accurately forecast future sales 
if sales forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues and our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we are highly dependent on our international sales  and face significant economic and regulatory risks because a majority of our net sales are from outside the united states 
asia has been a particularly important region for our business  and we anticipate that it will continue to be important as we expand our sales and marketing efforts by opening an office in china 
our sales to customers located in taiwan  japan  and other asian countries accounted for of our total sales in  in  and in during  europe also emerged as an important region for our business  contributing of our sales 
during and  sales to customers in europe accounted for and  respectively 
our international sales accounted for of our total net sales in  in and in and we anticipate international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our future net sales 
because of our continuing dependence upon international sales  however  we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities  including o unexpected changes in law or regulations resulting in more burdensome governmental controls  tariffs  restrictions  embargoes  or export license requirements  o exchange rate volatility  o the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and us export laws  o political and economic instability  particularly in asia  o differing labor regulations  o reduced protection for intellectual property  o difficulties in accounts receivable collections  o difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  and o changes in tariffs or taxes 
in the us  our sales to date have been denominated primarily in us dollars  while our sales in japan are usually denominated in japanese yen 
our sales to date in europe have been denominated in various currencies  currently primarily us dollars and the euro 
our sales in foreign currencies are subject to risks of currency fluctuation 
although we have  adopted a foreign currency hedging program  to date we have engaged in immaterial amounts hedging transactions or used derivative financial instruments to mitigate our currency risks 
for us dollar sales in foreign countries  our products become less price competitive where the local currency is declining in value compared to the dollar 
this could cause us to lose sales or force us to lower our prices  which would reduce our gross margins 
in addition  we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business  and maintain certain manufacturing facilities in germany 
managing our global operations presents challenges  including varying business conditions and demands  political instability  export restrictions and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth if we are not selected as vendor of choice for new or expanded fabrication facilities or if our systems and products do not achieve broader market acceptance 
because semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor fabrication facility  these manufacturers will tend to choose semiconductor equipment manufacturers based on established relationships  product compatibility  and proven financial performance 
once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular vendor s capital equipment  the manufacturer generally relies for a significant period of time upon equipment from this vendor of choice for the specific production line application 
in addition  the semiconductor manufacturer frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  we may face narrow windows of opportunity to be selected as the vendor of choice by substantial new customers 
it may be difficult for us to sell to a particular customer for a significant period of time once that customer selects a competitor s product  and we may not be successful in obtaining broader acceptance of our systems and technology 
if we are unable to achieve broader market acceptance of our systems and technology  we may be unable to grow our business and our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
unless we can continue to develop and introduce new systems that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance  we may lose future sales and customers  our business may suffer  and our stock price may decline 
because of continual changes in the markets in which our customers and we compete  our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to improve our systems and technologies 
these markets are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  and continuous improvements in products and services 
due to the continual changes in these markets  our success will also depend upon our ability to develop new technologies and systems that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and that adequately address customer requirements 
in addition  we must adapt our systems and processes to support emerging target market industry standards 
the success of any new systems we introduce is dependent on a number of factors  including timely completion of new system designs accepted by the market  and may be adversely affected by manufacturing inefficiencies and the challenge of producing systems in volume which meet customer requirements 
we may not be able to improve our existing systems or develop new technologies or systems in a timely manner 
in particular  the transition of the market to mm wafers will present us with both an opportunity and a risk 
to the extent that we are unable to introduce mm systems that meet customer requirements on a timely basis  our business could be harmed 
we may exceed the budgeted cost of reaching our research  development and engineering objectives  and estimated product development schedules may require extension 
any delays or additional development costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
because of the complexity of our systems  significant delays can occur between the introduction of systems or system enhancements and the commencement of commercial shipments 
the timing of the transition to mm technology is uncertain and competition may be intense 
we have invested  and are continuing to invest  substantial resources to develop new systems and technologies to automate the processing of mm wafers 
however  the timing of the industry s transition to mm manufacturing technology is uncertain  partly as a result of the recent period of reduced demand for semiconductors 
delay in the transition to mm manufacturing technology could adversely affect our potential revenues and opportunities for future growth 
moreover  delay in the transition to mm technology could permit our competitors to introduce competing or superior mm products at more competitive prices  causing competition to become more vigorous 
delays or technical and manufacturing difficulties incurred in the introduction of new products could be costly and adversely affect our customer relationships 
from time to time  we have experienced delays in the introduction of  and certain technical and manufacturing difficulties with  certain systems and enhancements  and may experience such delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of new systems or enhancements 
for example  our inability to overcome such difficulties  to meet the technical specifications of any new systems or enhancements  or to manufacture and ship these systems or enhancements in volume and in a timely manner  would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  as well as our customer relationships 
in addition  we may from time to time incur unanticipated costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of our products early in their life cycles  which costs can be substantial 
if new products or enhancements experience reliability or quality problems  we could encounter a number of difficulties  including reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collection of accounts receivable  and additional service and warranty expenses  all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor equipment industry is both highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors include the following o system performance  o cost of ownership  o size of installed base  o breadth of product line  and o customer support 
the following characteristics of our major competitors systems may give them a competitive advantage over us o broader product lines  o longer operating history  o greater experience with high volume manufacturing  o broader name recognition  o substantially larger customer bases  and o substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources 
in addition  to expand our sales we must often replace the systems of our competitors or sell new systems to customers of our competitors 
our competitors may develop new or enhanced competitive products that will offer price or performance features that are superior to our systems 
our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their product lines 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our sales if competition increases and we are unable to respond effectively 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for some components and subassemblies  and supply shortages or the loss of these suppliers could result in increased cost or delays in manufacture and sale of our products 
we rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies of our systems 
we obtain some of these components and subassemblies from a sole source or a limited group of suppliers 
because of our anticipated reliance on outside vendors generally  and on a sole or a limited group of suppliers in particular  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components 
although we currently experience minimal delays in receiving goods from our suppliers  when demand for semiconductor equipment is strong  as it was in  our suppliers strained to provide components on a timely basis 
in addition  during periods of shortages of components  we may have reduced control over pricing and timely delivery of components 
we often quote prices to our customers and accept customer orders for our products prior to purchasing components and subassemblies from our suppliers 
if our suppliers increase the cost of components or subassemblies  we may not have alternative sources of supply and may no longer be able to increase the cost of the system being evaluated by our customers to cover all or part of the increased cost of components 
the manufacture of some of these components and subassemblies is an extremely complex process and requires long lead times 
as a result  we have in the past and we may in the future experience delays or shortages 
if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required components or subassemblies  we may have to seek alternative sources of supply or manufacture such components internally 
this could delay our ability to manufacture or timely ship our systems  causing us to lose sales  incur additional costs  delay new product introductions  and harm our reputation 
we are highly dependent on our key personnel to manage our business and their knowledge of our business  management skills  and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
our success will depend to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers  our current management and our technical staff  any of whom would be difficult to replace 
several of our executive officers have recently joined us or have assumed new responsibilities at the company 
the addition  reassignment or loss of key employees could limit or delay our ability to develop new products and adapt existing products to our customers evolving requirements and result in lost sales and diversion of management resources 
because of competition for additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel  which could impede development or sales of our products 
our growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
there is substantial competition for experienced engineering  technical  financial  sales  and marketing personnel in our industry 
in particular  we must attract and retain highly skilled design and process engineers 
historically  competition for such personnel has been intense in all of our locations  but particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters is located 
if we are unable to retain existing key personnel  or attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we may from time to time experience inadequate levels of staffing to develop and market our products and perform services for our customers 
as a result  our growth could be limited due to our lack of capacity to develop and market our products to our customers  or we could fail to meet our delivery commitments or experience deterioration in service levels or decreased customer satisfaction 
if the current downturn ends suddenly  we may not have enough personnel to promptly return to our previous production levels 
if we are unable to expand our existing manufacturing capacity to meet demand  a customer s placement of a large order for our products during a particular period might deter other customers from placing similar orders with us for the same period 
it could be difficult for us to rapidly recruit and train substantial numbers of qualified technical personnel to meet increased demand 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose a valuable asset  experience reduced market share  and efforts to protect our intellectual property may require additional costly litigation 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements  and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may be able to legitimately ascertain the non patented proprietary technology embedded in our systems 
if this occurs  we may not be able to prevent the use of such technology 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any patents owned by us could be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented and any rights granted under any patent may not provide adequate protection to us 
furthermore  we may not have sufficient resources to protect our rights 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products  or design around patents that may be issued to us 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and it may be more difficult to monitor the use of our products in such foreign countries 
as a result of these threats to our proprietary technology  we may have to resort to costly litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we are currently litigating several matters involving our wet division intellectual property 
these legal proceedings  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend  and could divert management s attention and resources 
there can be no assurance as to the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims 
defenses or counterclaims in these proceedings could result in the nullification of any or all of the subject patents 
we might face intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve and could divert management attention including the potential for patent infringement litigation as a result of our increased market strength in rtp and entry into the wet processing market 
we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
competitors alleging infringement of such competitors patents have in the past sued our acquired company  steag semiconductor division 
although all such historic lawsuits have been settled or terminated  the risk of further intellectual property litigation for us may be increased following the expansion of our business after the merger 
our involvement in any patent dispute or other intellectual property dispute or action to protect trade secrets  even if the claims are without merit  could be very expensive to defend and could divert the attention of our management 
adverse determinations in any litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek costly licenses from third parties  and prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
any of these situations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in one or more countries 
our failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in substantial liability 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local  and foreign laws  rules  and regulations relating to environmental protection 
these laws  rules  and regulations govern the use  storage  discharge  and disposal of hazardous chemicals during manufacturing  research and development and sales demonstrations 
if we fail to comply with present or future regulations  we could be subject to substantial liability for clean up efforts  personal injury  and fines or suspension or cessation of our operations 
we may be subject to liability if our acquired companies have past violations 
restrictions on our ability to expand or continue to operate our present locations could be imposed upon us or we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or incur other significant expenses 
the effect of terrorist threats on the general economy could decrease our revenues 
on september   the united states was subject to terrorist attacks at the world trade center buildings in new york city and the pentagon in washington dc the potential near and long term impact these attacks may have in regards to our suppliers and customers  markets for their products and the us economy are uncertain 
there may be other potential adverse effects on our operating results due to this significant event that we cannot foresee 
future sales of shares by steag could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
there are approximately million shares of our common stock outstanding as of december   of which approximately million or are held beneficially by steag 
steag has agreed to restrictions on its ability to acquire additional shares of our stock  other than to maintain its percentage ownership in us  and from soliciting proxies and certain other standstill restrictions in connection with voting shares of our common stock  for a period of five years after its acquisition of the stock 
steag may sell these shares in the public markets from time to time  subject to certain limitations on the timing  amount and method of such sales imposed by sec regulations  and steag has the right to require us to register for resale all or a portion of the shares they hold 
if steag were to sell a large number of shares  the market price of our common stock could decline 
moreover  the perception in the public markets that such sales by steag might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  which may lead to losses by investors or to securities litigation 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile in the past  and our stock price may decline in the future 
we believe that a number of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially  including o general conditions in the semiconductor industry or in the worldwide economy  o announcements of developments related to our business  o fluctuations in our operating results and order levels  o announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors  o new products or product enhancements by us or by our competitors  o developments in patent litigation or other intellectual property rights  or o developments in our relationships with our customers  distributors  and suppliers 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for shares of high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
these fluctuations have frequently been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility in its stock price 
this type of litigation  if filed against us  could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
any future business acquisitions may disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value  or distract management attention 
as part of our ongoing business strategy  we may consider additional acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer products  services  and technologies complementary to our own 
such acquisitions could materially adversely affect our operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions also entail numerous risks  including o difficulty of assimilating the operations  products  and personnel of the acquired businesses  o potential disruption of our ongoing business  o unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  o inability of management to manage the financial and strategic position of acquired or developed products  services  and technologies  o inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  policies  and procedures  and o impairment of relationships with employees and customers that may occur as a result of integration of the acquired business 
to the extent that shares of our stock or other rights to purchase stock are issued in connection with any future acquisitions  dilution to our existing stockholders will result and our earnings per share may suffer 
any future acquisitions may not generate additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business  and we may not achieve a satisfactory return on our investment in any acquired businesses 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash equivalents and short term investments  as all of these investments are at fixed interest rates 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio and the fair value of each as of december  fair value december  in thousands assets cash and cash equivalents  average interest rate restricted cash  average interest rate short term investments  average interest rate foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
during  we employed a foreign currency hedging program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency fluctuations with japan 
the goal of the hedging program is to lock in exchange rates to minimize the impact to us of foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the following table provides information as of december  about our derivative financial instruments  which are comprised of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the information is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts 
the table presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates  and the estimated fair value of those contracts 
average estimated notional contract fair amount rate value in thousands  except for average contract rate foreign currency forward exchange contracts japanese yen   the local currency is the functional currency for all foreign sales operations 
our exposure to foreign currency risk has increased as a result of our global expansion of business 
in addition  a payment obligation to steag ag in the amount estimated to be million is payable in euros and  accordingly  there exists exposure for exchange rate volatility 
the exposure for the exchange rate volatility of the steag payment obligation has been mostly neutralized by using a natural balance sheet hedge and keeping euros in a foreign currency bank account 
the balance of this bank account was million euros at december
