critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions including those related to deferred expenses  bad debts  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill  income taxes  and contingencies on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
management suggests that the company s summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 

table of contents revenue recognition 
the company earns revenue primarily from the time charter contracts of its vessels based on a rate per day of service basis 
the majority of contracts are term contracts whose terms range from three months to two years 
the company also provides time charter contracts of its vessels on a spot basis 
in a term contract  the base rate of hire generally remains constant  however  contracts often include escalating clauses to recover specific costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to one week 
marine vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
receivables 
in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  development and production companies 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes adequate provisions for probable doubtful accounts 
the company self insures potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
the company is exposed to insurance risk related to the company s contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount it expects to receive and also estimates losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported 
the company also monitors its reinsurance recoverable balances regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and makes adequate provisions for probable doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
goodwill 
at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill primarily relates to the fiscal acquisition of oil  ltd  a british company 
the company elected to adopt  as of april   statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes a new method of testing goodwill for impairment using a fair value based approach and does not permit amortization of goodwill as previously required by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
an impairment loss would be recorded if the recorded goodwill amount exceeds its implied fair value 
as the company adopted sfas no 
as of april   goodwill amortization was ceased at that time 
the company tests goodwill impairment annually at a reporting unit level  as required  using carrying amounts as of december the company considers its reporting units to be its domestic and international operations 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s related cost of capital 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit is less than recorded goodwill for the reporting unit  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the excess 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the implied fair value of each reporting unit  such as  utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december   and the test determined there was no goodwill impairment 
interim testing will be performed when events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include significant adverse industry or economic changes  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 
goodwill amortization on a pre tax basis for the year ended march  would have been million  or 
per share after tax  had the company not adopted sfas no 
for both fiscal years ended march  and  pre tax goodwill amortization amounted to million  or 
per share after tax 

table of contents for the fiscal years and  the company amortized goodwill as previously required by apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
for the fiscal years and  the company had goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  which represented and  respectively  of total assets  and and  respectively  of stockholders equity 
the goodwill amount was amortized over years 
the company considered many factors in assigning such amortization period including the projected future cash flows of the acquired business and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors that may reduce a useful life 
management periodically evaluated whether subsequent events or circumstances had occurred that indicated the remaining useful life of goodwill may warrant revision or that the remaining goodwill balance may not have been recoverable 
if an evaluation were necessary  projected undiscounted future operating cash flows of the net assets acquired would have been compared to the carrying amount in order to determine if impairment existed 
if goodwill was considered to be impaired  the impairment that would have been recognized was measured based upon projected discounted future operating cash flows using the company s average cost of funds for the discount rate 
for fiscal and  management determined that there was no persuasive evidence that any material portion of goodwill dissipated over a shorter period than the amortization period used 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset are compared with the amount recorded for the asset to determine if a write down may be required 
the company estimates cash flow based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of future market performance that is based on industry trends 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the long lived asset is reduced to the estimated fair value of the asset  based upon its estimated future discounted cash flows 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
income taxes 
the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which we operate internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
vessel acquisition and construction programs on january   the company entered into agreements with three shipyards for the construction of seven large platform supply and five large anchor handling towing supply vessels 
all of these vessels are capable of working in most deepwater markets of the world 
the total estimated cost for the vessels is approximately million  which includes shipyard commitments and other incidental costs such as spare parts  management and supervision  and outfitting costs 
the new build program was initiated in order to better service the needs of the company s customers in the deepwater markets of the world 
four of the platform supply vessels contracts were awarded to the company s shipyard  quality shipyards  llc  while the remaining eight vessels are being built at two far east shipyards 
all four platform supply vessels constructed at quality shipyards  llc will be built to full jones act compliance 
eleven of the vessels under contract have not yet been delivered 
quality shipyards  llc has completed the construction of one large platform supply vessel for an approximate cost of million 
the vessel was delivered to the market during the fourth quarter of fiscal scheduled delivery for the remaining vessels is expected to begin in july with final delivery of the last vessel in september 
table of contents as of march   million has been expended on the remaining vessels of the total estimated million of commitments 
during fiscal the company also committed to the construction of two large  north sea type platform supply vessels and six foot next generation supply vessels for approximately million 
one of the large platform supply vessels is being built in norway and one in brazil  and both are designed and equipped for deepwater work 
the company s shipyard  quality shipyard  llc  will construct two of the foot platform supply vessels while a different us shipyard will construct the remaining four 
the six vessels are intermediate in size and are technically capable of working in certain deepwater markets  however  these vessels are being constructed in order to replace older supply vessels 
scheduled delivery of the eight vessels is expected to commence in july with final delivery in july as of march   million has been expended on these vessels 
in fiscal the company took delivery of three large platform supply vessels built in norway for a total cost of million 
during the first quarter of fiscal the company finalized the cash purchase of two anchor handling towing supply vessels for million 
the three large platform supply vessels and two anchor handling towing supply vessels are specifically designed and equipped for deepwater work 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company announced that it was expanding its crewboat fleet 
the company purchased existing crewboats and assumed four new build contracts from crewboats  inc  a privately held  leading independent provider of crewboat services in the gulf of mexico  for approximately million 
the scheduled delivery dates for the four crewboats is expected to commence in may with final delivery in september no amounts have been expended on the four crewboats of the total million commitment  as the individual vessels purchase prices are due upon delivery of the respective vessels 
in addition  during the second quarter of fiscal  the company committed million to the construction of four  foot  state of the art  fast  crew supply boats that blend the speed of a crewboat with the capabilities of a supply vessel 
the four crewboats are being constructed at a us shipyard and scheduled delivery of the four crewboats is expected to commence in november  with final delivery in october as of march   million has been expended on these vessels 
throughout fiscal the company constructed and took delivery of four large traditional crewboats that were built at us shipyards for approximately million 
the table below summarizes the number of company vessels that have been added to its fleet during fiscal by vessel class and vessel type vessel class and type number of vessels deepwater vessels anchor handling towing supply platform supply vessels crew utility crewboats total number of company vessels added to its fleet during fiscal the table below summarizes the various vessel commitments by vessel class and type as of march  vessel class and type number of vessels scheduled delivery dates deepwater vessels anchor handling towing supply january through september platform supply vessels july through january towing supply supply platform supply vessels october through july crew utility crewboats foot may through september crewboats foot november through october total number of vessels to be added to the fleet the company has been financing all the vessel commitment programs from its current cash balances  its operating cash flow and its revolving credit facility 
of the total million of capital commitments the company has expended million as of march  
table of contents on november  the company purchased eight vessels from the sanko steamship co  ltd 
for million in cash 
four of the vessels are large anchor handling towing supply vessels and four are large north sea type platform supply vessels 
in addition  throughout fiscal  the company purchased three large platform supply vessels for approximately million 
during fiscal  the company acquired six new build vessels  which included one supply vessel  two offshore tugs and three crew boats  for an aggregate cash payment of approximately million from an industry competitor 
all six vessels were delivered to the market during fiscal also during fiscal  the company purchased two large  platform supply vessels for approximately million both vessels are specifically designed and equipped for deepwater work 
vessel dispositions during the second quarter of fiscal the company sold its holding in its consolidated marine joint venture  maritide offshore oil services company sae  for approximately million  resulting in a million gain 
as a result of the sale  the international towing supply supply vessel count decreased by five vessels 
during the third quarter of fiscal the company sold four vessels two offshore tugs and two crewboats to one of its owned unconsolidated joint ventures for million  of which million was financed by the company 
the transaction resulted in a gain on asset sale of million 
during the second quarter of fiscal the company sold its holding in its unconsolidated marine joint venture  national marine service nms  for approximately million  resulting in a million gain 
the after tax effect of the gain on the sale was million  or 
per share 
as a result of the sale  the joint venture vessel count decreased by vessels 
in order to avoid potential overcapacity in our markets that could be created through the addition of the new vessels discussed in the vessel acquisition and construction programs section above  the company has sold and or scrapped vessels between april and march the mix of vessels disposed of includes towing supply supply vessels  crew utility vessels  offshore tugs  safety standby vessels and other vessels  primarily barges 
included in the vessel disposition count are the nms and maritide vessels discussed above 
general market conditions and results of operations fiscal results of operations surpassed those achieved in fiscal due to strengthened world crude oil commodity prices 
throughout fiscal  opec adjusted crude oil production levels and successfully negotiated with several non opec oil producing countries to adjust their respective production levels in order to help stabilize and maintain crude oil commodity prices at levels that would sustain growth 
the higher crude oil prices resulted in international offshore drilling  exploration and production companies increasing their capital spending budgets 
international vessel demand  which is primarily driven by crude oil production  increased throughout fiscal as a result of the improved international market conditions and is expected to remain solid during fiscal domestic vessel demand  which is primarily driven by natural gas production  declined steadily throughout fiscal as exploration and production companies operating in the us gulf of mexico reduced their capital investments in the gulf 
the high offshore rig fleet utilization rates achieved during fiscal began to steadily decrease during the second quarter of fiscal and continued to decrease throughout the remainder of fiscal on the news that inventory levels for natural gas were increasing as a result of unseasonably moderate weather and economic slowdowns in the united states and globally 
it is unknown how much further domestic based vessel demand will be affected by the downward trend in 
table of contents offshore drilling and exploration in the us gulf of mexico 
the company s depressed vessel utilization rates in the us gulf of mexico are the lowest that the company has experienced in well over a decade 
international based vessel revenues increased as compared to fiscal due to higher average day rates  utilization  and an increase in the number of active vessels in the international based fleet 
the number of active vessels in the international fleet increased as a result of an aggressive deepwater vessel acquisition and construction program that began during fiscal seventeen deepwater vessels have been added to the company s fleet since the beginning of fiscal  seven of which are fulfilling bareboat contractual obligations that existed at the time the vessels were purchased 
the bareboat charter agreements on four of the seven vessels will expire at various times over the next two years while the bareboat charter agreements on the remaining three vessels will expire at various times over the next two years with the option to extend certain contracts for another two years 
in a bareboat charter agreement  the bareboat charterer leases a vessel for a pre arranged fee and is able to market the vessel and is also responsible for providing the crew and all other operating costs related to the vessel 
for the vessels that tidewater has under bareboat contracts  only revenue and depreciation expense is recorded related to the vessels activity 
as tidewater incurs no operating costs related to the vessels  the related bareboat day rates are less than comparable vessels operating under normal charter hire agreements 
for both fiscal years ended march  and the seven bareboat chartered deepwater vessels experienced utilization and average day rates of  the international based deepwater vessel fleet  excluding the bareboat chartered vessels discussed above  experienced approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  for the year ended march  domestic based vessel revenues increased slightly as compared to fiscal as a result of higher average day rates 
average day rates increased due to strong demand for the company s vessels in the us gulf of mexico during the first quarter of fiscal that continued from fiscal however  during the second quarter of fiscal  vessel demand began to decrease and continued to decrease throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as offshore drilling and exploration in the us gulf of mexico waned 
the company was able to achieve solid average day rates throughout fiscal  although it did experience deterioration in vessel utilization throughout fiscal at march   the towing supply supply vessels  the company s largest major income producing asset in the us gulf of mexico  experienced approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  fiscal results of operations improved as compared to fiscal because of a stronger energy sector 
oil and natural gas commodity prices appreciated significantly between calendar year and the first quarter of the strong price of oil and natural gas combined with severely tight inventory levels for both crude oil and natural gas increased the demand for working drilling rigs and services in the us gulf of mexico and globally 
strong worldwide demand for natural resources prompted the oil and gas exploration and production companies to increase their capital spending budgets in order to take advantage of improving industry conditions 
us based vessel demand increased throughout fiscal as market conditions and drilling rig utilization rates increased in the us gulf of mexico 
international drilling expenditures did not increase as significantly as in the us gulf of mexico 
international drilling activity began increasing in the latter half of calendar year and continued to increase gradually throughout fiscal witnessed worldwide offshore drilling rig utilization rates increase to levels not seen since the latter part of calendar year fiscal us based vessel revenues increased approximately as compared to fiscal due to higher utilization and average day rates 
improved market conditions and vessel demand in the us gulf of mexico helped to increase the average day rates for the us based towing supply supply vessels  the company s major income producing asset 
at march   the towing supply supply vessels operating in the us gulf of mexico experienced approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  per day 
fiscal international based vessel revenues decreased approximately as compared to fiscal due to a decrease in the number of active vessels in the international based fleet 
international average day rates for the years ended march  and were basically unchanged 
the number of 
table of contents active vessels in the international fleet decreased because the company sold its safety standby fleet in july  as it did not conform to the company s long range strategies 
after removing the revenue effect of the safety standby fleet  fiscal revenues were comparable to fiscal international based vessel utilization rates increased slightly during the comparative periods  but primarily as a result of withdrawing several older  little used vessels from active service during the latter part of fiscal at which time they were removed from the utilization statistics 
at march   the vessels operating in the international areas experienced approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  fiscal results of operations reflect the continued impact of the curtailment in capital spending in the oil industry as a result of the drop in oil prices that commenced in the fall of although oil prices had increased substantially throughout fiscal  the capital spending levels of oil and gas exploration and production companies continued to be below levels 
the oil industry downturn affected the us gulf of mexico vessel market most sharply as the duration of vessel contracts in this region normally range from one to three months 
further depressing the market was the delivery of a number of newly constructed supply vessels to various industry competitors which negatively affected the supply and demand balance for supply vessels in the gulf of mexico and some international markets  thereby putting continued downward pressure on vessel utilization and day rates 
us based vessel activity stabilized during the early part of fiscal and recovered gradually throughout the remainder of fiscal fiscal international activity was not as dramatically affected by the downturn in the oil industry due primarily to the longer term nature of international vessel contracts 
international based vessel demand  which weakened sharply during the fourth quarter of fiscal and declined throughout the first and second quarter of fiscal  stabilized during the third quarter of fiscal at march   the towing supply supply vessels operating in the us gulf of mexico experienced approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  per day 
at march   the international based vessels fleet experienced utilization and average day rates of approximately  per day 
the company withdraws from active service older  little used vessels at which time the vessels are removed from the utilization statistics 
vessel utilization rates are a function of vessel days worked and vessel days available for active vessels only 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company withdrew vessels  primarily towing supply supply vessels  from active service 
eight vessels were withdrawn from active service during fiscal during fiscal  the company withdrew vessels  the majority of which were withdrawn from service during the latter half of the fiscal year 
thirty two of the vessels withdrawn from service during fiscal were towing supply supply vessels  were crewboats and six were barges 
vessels that are withdrawn from active service are intended to be sold 
the company continues to dispose of its older vessels out of the active fleet and the withdrawn fleet that are not marketable due to obsolescence or are economically prohibitive to operate due to high repair costs 
offshore service vessels provide a diverse range of services and equipment to the energy industry 
fleet size  utilization and vessel day rates primarily determine the amount of revenues and operating profit because operating costs and depreciation do not change proportionally when revenue changes 
operating costs primarily consist of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance  fuel  lube oil and supplies 
fleet size and utilization are the major factors which affect crew costs 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by customer demands  vessel age and scheduled drydockings to satisfy safety and inspection requirements mandated by regulatory agencies 
whenever possible  vessel drydockings are done during seasonally slow periods to minimize any impact on vessel operations and are only done if economically justified  given the vessel s age and physical condition 
the following table compares revenues and operating expenses excluding general and administrative expenses and depreciation expense for the company s vessel fleet for the years ended march vessel revenues and operating costs relate to vessels owned and operated by the company  while other marine

marine operating profit and other components of earnings before income taxes for the years ended march consists of the following in thousands vessel activity united states international gain on sales of assets other marine services operating profit other income corporate expenses interest and other debt costs earnings before income taxes operating profit for fiscal increased as compared to fiscal as a result of increases in vessel revenues 
crew costs increased during fiscal as a result of better market conditions and additional vessels in the international areas of operations 
repair and maintenance costs decreased from the fiscal level as fiscal included an unusually high number of drydocks as explained in detail below 
included in fiscal s gain on sales of assets is a million gain from the sale of the company s holding in its consolidated marine joint venture  maritide offshore oil services company sae  for approximately million and a million writedown in the carrying values of certain vessels that were withdrawn from active service and held for sale 
the writedown is a result of reviewing the recoverability of the carrying values of the vessels that were withdrawn from active service 
fiscal other income decreased as compared to fiscal because the company had less excess cash invested in short term  interest bearing securities than the previous fiscal year as a result of the use of the funds for vessel acquisition and new build programs 
operating profit for fiscal increased as compared to fiscal as a result of increases in vessel revenues partially offset by higher repair and maintenance costs 
repair and maintenance costs increased as a result of costs incurred from an intense drydocking program the company initiated during the first quarter of fiscal and continued during the second and third quarters of fiscal in order to ready equipment for an expected improvement in demand for its vessels 
the company initiated this drydocking program while vessel demand and average day rates had not fully recovered  thus sacrificing higher 
table of contents profitability in anticipation of higher average day rates and vessel demand when market conditions improved 
gains on sales of assets increased primarily as a result of the sale of the company s holding in its unconsolidated marine joint venture  national marine service  for approximately million resulting in a million gain 
as a result of the uncertainty of a certain customer to make payment of vessel charter hire  the company has deferred the recognition of approximately million of billings as of march   million of billings as of march  and million of billings as of march  which would otherwise have been recognized as revenue 
the company will recognize the amounts as revenue as cash is collected or at such time as the uncertainty has been reduced 
the reduction in the balance of deferred billings over the last three fiscal years is a result of increased cash collections and a reduction in the level of operating activity with the customer 
vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created through the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided also influence vessel day rates 
the day based utilization percentages and average day rates tables include a new vessel class category for the deepwater vessel fleet 
included in this class are large platform supply vessels and large  high horsepowered anchor handling towing supply vessels that are capable of operating in deepwater markets globally

consolidated general and administrative expenses for the years ended march consists of the following components in thousands personnel office and property sales and marketing professional service other general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased as compared to fiscal due to an improving business environment in the international market 
fiscal general and administrative costs were comparable to fiscal liquidity  capital resources and other matters the company s current ratio  level of working capital and amount of cash flows from operations for any year are directly related to fleet activity and vessel day rates 
variations from year to year in these items are primarily the result of market conditions 
as a result of recent vessel purchases and vessel construction programs  the company s cash balances at march  are considerably less than at recent fiscal year ends 
cash from operations  in combination with an available line of credit  provide the company  in management s opinion  with adequate resources to satisfy its current financing requirements
