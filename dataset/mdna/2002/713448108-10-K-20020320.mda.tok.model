item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition on august   we completed a merger transaction  which resulted in the quaker oats company quaker becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of pepsico 
as a result  we restated all prior periods presented to reflect the combined results of operations  financial position and cash flows of both companies as if they had always been merged 
for further detail see 
merger of pepsico and the quaker oats company 
tabular dollars are in millions  except per share amounts 
all per share amounts reflect common per share amounts  assume dilution unless noted  and are based on unrounded amounts 
percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts 
management s discussion and analysis is presented in four sections 
the first section discusses 
critical accounting policies  
transactions with related and other parties  
items affecting comparability  
new accounting standards and 
market and other risk factors 
the second section analyzes the 
results of operations  first on a consolidated basis and then for each of our business segments 
the final two sections address 
consolidated cash flows and 
liquidity and capital resources 
cautionary statements from time to time  in written reports and in oral statements  we discuss expectations regarding our future performance including synergies from the merger  the impact of the euro conversion and the impact of global macroeconomic issues 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive  financial and economic data and our operating plans 
they are inherently uncertain  and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations 
introduction to our business critical accounting policies an understanding of our accounting policies is necessary for a complete analysis of our results  financial position  liquidity and trends 
we focus your attention on the following principles of consolidation the financial statements include the consolidated accounts of pepsico  inc and its controlled affiliates 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates over which we exercise significant influence  but not control  are accounted for by the equity method 
our definition of control for majority owned affiliates considers the exercisability of the minority interest rights  and consolidation would be precluded to the extent that the minority interest holds substantive participating rights 
our share of the net income or loss of unconsolidated affiliates accounted for by the equity method is included in our consolidated net income 
as a result of changes in the operations of our european snack joint venture  we have determined that  effective in  consolidation is required 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are delivered to customers consistent with sales terms 
sales terms generally do not allow a right of return 
derivative instruments and hedging we manage risks associated with commodity prices  foreign exchange rates  interest rates and our stock price and may use derivative instruments to hedge these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and  therefore  we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the evaluation of hedge effectiveness is subject to assumptions based on the terms and timing of the underlying exposures 
all derivative instruments are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is generally based on quoted market prices 
asset impairment all long lived assets  including goodwill  investments in unconsolidated affiliates and other identifiable intangibles  are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used in these cash flows are consistent with internal forecasts 
income taxes our effective tax rate and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
valuation allowances are established where expected future taxable income does not support the realization of the deferred tax assets 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  taxes and environmental matters  as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations 
we recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable 
our contractual and other commercial obligations primarily relate to the procurement of goods and services in the normal course of business and to guarantees related to our equity investees 
refer to 
note to the financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies 
transactions with related and other parties significant related parties include our bottling franchisees in which we own an equity interest 
we have entered into agreements with these bottlers and expect these arrangements to continue 
these agreements cover the prices and terms for the sale of concentrate and full goods bearing our trademarks  as well as the manufacturing and distribution of our fountain products 
in addition  we provide various forms of marketing support to or on behalf of our bottlers covering a variety of initiatives including marketplace support  marketing programs  capital equipment and shared media expense 
the level of this support is negotiated annually and can be increased or decreased at our discretion 
we provide this support because we share a common business objective with our bottlers of increasing the availability and consumption of pepsi cola beverages and the level of support has a direct impact on these objectives 
see 
liquidity and capital resources for related party commitments and guarantees and 
note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on related parties 
certain members of our board of directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers 
our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers 
those board members do not participate in vendor selection and negotiations nor in customer negotiations 
in addition  certain officers serve on the boards of our anchor bottlers and other equity investees and may receive compensation from such entities consistent with that of other members serving on those boards 
items affecting comparability fifty third week in comparisons of to and are affected by an additional week of results in the reporting year 
because our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december  a fifty third week is added every five or six years 
the fifty third week increased net sales by an estimated million  operating profit by an estimated million and net income by an estimated million or per share 
merger of pepsico and the quaker oats company under the quaker merger agreement dated december   quaker shareholders received shares of pepsico common stock in exchange for each share of quaker common stock  including a cash payment for fractional shares 
we issued approximately million shares of our common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of quaker 
in connection with the merger transaction  we sold the global rights in our all sport beverage brand to the monarch company  inc of atlanta 
as part of the terms of the sale  we agreed that  for years after the quaker transaction closing date  we would not distribute gatorade sports drink through our bottling system in the united states and would not include gatorade with pepsi cola products in certain marketing or promotional arrangements covering specific distribution channels 
the merger was accounted for as a tax free transaction and as a pooling of interests 
as a result  all prior period consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of both companies as if they had always been combined 
certain reclassifications were made to conform the presentation of the financial statements  and the fiscal calendar and certain interim reporting policies were also conformed 
there were no material transactions between pre merger pepsico and quaker 
the results of operations of the separate companies and the combined company for the most recent interim period prior to the merger and for the years presented in the consolidated financial statements are as follows weeks ended reported net sales pepsico    quaker    adjustments a combined    reported net income pepsico    quaker adjustments a combined    a adjustments reflect the impact of changing quaker s fiscal calendar to conform to pepsico s and conforming the accounting policies of the two companies applicable to interim reporting 
these changes have no impact on full year net sales or net income 
during  we recognized costs of million associated with our merger with quaker 
the components of these merger related costs were as follows transaction costs integration and restructuring costs total merger related costs after tax per share transaction costs were incurred to complete the merger and consist primarily of fees and expenses for investment bankers  attorneys and accountants  sec filing fees  stock exchange listing fees and financial printing and other related charges 
integration costs represent incremental one time merger related costs 
such costs include consulting fees and expenses  expenses for accelerated vesting under change in control provisions  information system integration costs and employee related costs 
the restructuring charges primarily reflect termination costs for approximately corporate  sales  distribution  manufacturing  research and marketing employees 
employee termination costs include retirement benefit costs  severance costs and expenses associated with change in control provisions of pre merger employment contracts 
as of december   approximately of the terminations have occurred 
the terminations are expected to be completed during additional merger related actions are expected to bring the total integration costs and restructuring charges to between million and million 
ongoing merger related cost savings and revenue enhancement opportunities are expected to reach million a year by we expect to achieve up to million of the synergies by the end of other impairment and restructuring charges asset impairment charges held and used in the business property  plant and equipment held for disposal abandonment property  plant and equipment total asset impairment restructuring charges employee related costs other charges total restructuring total after tax per share and the and other impairment and restructuring charges relate to a three year supply chain reconfiguration project announced in to upgrade and optimize quaker s manufacturing and distribution capabilities across all of its north american businesses 
the asset impairment charges primarily reflect the reduction in the carrying value of the land  buildings and production machinery and equipment to their estimated fair market value based on analyses of the liquidation values of similar assets 
the restructuring charges primarily included severance and termination benefits for approximately  employees and other shutdown costs 
no future charges are expected on this project 
the other impairment and restructuring charges of million were comprised of the following a charge of million  for asset impairment of million and restructuring charges of million  related to the closure of three plants and impairment of equipment at frito lay north america 
the asset impairment charges primarily reflected the reduction in the carrying value of the land and buildings to their estimated fair market value based on selling prices for comparable real estate  less costs to sell  and the write off of the net book value of equipment which could not be redeployed 
the plant closures were completed during the majority of these assets were either disposed of or abandoned in the restructuring charges of million primarily included severance costs and plant closing costs

substantially all of the terminations occurred during total restructuring reserves of million  including merger related reserves  at december   are included in accounts payable and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
bottling transactions during  we completed a series of transactions creating our anchor bottlers 
in april  certain wholly owned bottling businesses  referred to as the pepsi bottling group pbg  completed an initial public offering with pepsico retaining a direct noncontrolling ownership interest of 
in may  we combined certain other bottling operations with whitman corporation retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 
in july  we combined certain other bottling operations with pepcom industries  inc retaining a noncontrolling interest of in the combined entity renamed pepsi bottling ventures  llc 
in october  we formed a business venture with pohlad companies  a pepsi cola franchisee  retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately in the venture s principal operating subsidiary  pepsiamericas  inc our financial statements include the results of our bottling operations on a consolidated basis through the transaction dates above  and our proportionate share of income under the equity method subsequent to those dates 
in december  whitman merged with pepsiamericas 
we now own approximately of the combined company  which has since changed its name to pepsiamericas  inc as part of the merger  we participate in an earn out option whereby we may receive additional shares when certain performance targets are met 
our three anchor bottlers distribute approximately three fourths of our beverage products in north america 
tax item in  quaker adjusted its tax accruals and tax assets to reflect developments and information received during the year 
the net effect of these adjustments reduced the income tax provision by million or per share 
new accounting standards on december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the adoption of sfas on december  increased assets by approximately million and liabilities by approximately million with approximately million recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and a loss of less than million recognized in the consolidated statement of income 
during and  the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf addressed various issues related to the income statement classification of certain promotional payments  including consideration from a vendor to a reseller or another party that purchases the vendor s products 
eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products was issued in november and codified earlier pronouncements 
primarily effective for  adoption of eitf will reduce our net sales by billion in  billion in and billion in  with selling  general and administrative expenses reduced by the same amounts 
in july  the fasb issued sfas  business combinations 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and modifies the application of the purchase accounting method 
the elimination of the pooling of interests method is effective for transactions initiated after june  the remaining provisions of sfas are effective for transactions accounted for using the purchase method that are completed after june  since our merger with quaker see 
note to the consolidated financial statements was initiated in december and our acquisition of south beach beverage company  llc see 
note to the consolidated financial statements was completed in january  adoption of this statement does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb also issued sfas  goodwill and intangibles 
sfas eliminates the current requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas applies to existing goodwill and intangible assets  as well as to transactions completed after the statement s effective date 
sfas is effective for adoption of sfas will increase income before taxes by approximately million in reflecting the cessation of goodwill amortization and changes in the lives of other intangibles 
the required transition impairment evaluations are not expected to result in impairment charges 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it requires that we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
we are currently assessing sfas and the impact that adoption  in  will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas establishes a single model for the impairment of long lived assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas is effective for adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
market and other risk factors market risks the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are commodity prices  affecting the cost of our raw materials and fuel  foreign exchange risks  interest rates on our debt and short term investment portfolios  and our stock price 
in the normal course of business  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  including the use of hedging transactions  executed in accordance with our policies 
our hedging transactions include  but are not limited to  the use of various derivative instruments 
as a matter of policy  we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and  therefore  we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items 
commodity prices we are subject to market risk with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage this risk primarily through the use of fixed price purchase orders  pricing agreements  geographic diversity and derivative instruments 
derivative instruments  including futures  options and swaps  are used to hedge fluctuations in prices of a portion of anticipated commodity purchases  primarily corn  oats  natural gas  heating oil  vegetable oil and packaging materials 
our use of derivative instruments is not significant to our commodity purchases 
our commodity derivative positions were million at december  and million at december  our commodity derivative positions resulted in a net unrealized loss of million at december  and a net unrealized gain of million at december  we estimate that a decline in commodity prices would have increased the loss by million in and reduced the gain by million resulting in a loss in foreign exchange international operations constitute about one fifth of our annual business segment operating profit 
operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates  primarily the mexican peso  british pound  canadian dollar  euro and brazilian real  which principally impacts the translation of our international operating profit into us dollars 
on occasion  we may enter into derivative instruments  as necessary  to reduce the effect of foreign exchange rate changes 
we manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally 
our foreign currency derivative positions had an aggregate notional value of million  with million relating to contracts to exchange british pounds for us dollars  at december  and million  with million relating to contracts to exchange british pounds to us dollars  at december  these forward contracts had a net gain of million at december  and losses of million at december  we estimate that an unfavorable change in the exchange rates would have decreased the gain by million resulting in a loss and increased the losses by million 
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
we use interest rate and currency swaps to effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances  with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs 
these swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt 
our credit risk related to interest rate and currency swaps is considered low because such swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy counterparties  are generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short duration 
assuming year end and variable rate debt and investment levels  a one point increase in interest rates would have increased net interest expense by million in and million in the change in this impact from resulted from decreased variable debt levels and increased investment levels at year end this sensitivity analysis includes the impact of existing interest rate and currency swaps 
stock price the portion of our deferred compensation liability which is based on our stock price is subject to market risk 
prepaid forward contracts with financial institutions with an aggregate notional amount of million at year end were used to hedge this risk and are accounted for as natural hedges 
the change in fair value of these equity derivative contracts resulted in million of expense in  million of income in and million of expense in we estimate that a unfavorable change in the year end stock price would have increased the loss by million and reduced the gain by million 
euro conversion our operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion successfully addressed the issues raised by the euro currency conversion including  among others  adapting computer and financial systems  business processes and equipment  such as vending machines  to accommodate euro denominated transactions and took actions to reduce the impact of one common currency on cross border pricing 
we have experienced no business interruption as a result of the issuance and circulation of euro denominated bills and coins and the withdrawal of legacy currencies 
the system and equipment conversion costs were not material 
due to numerous uncertainties  we cannot reasonably estimate the long term effects one common currency may have on pricing and the resulting impact  if any  on financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations general in the discussions below  the year over year dollar change in unit sales is referred to as volume 
price changes over the prior year and the impact of product  package and country sales mix changes are referred to as effective net pricing 
comparable results in all periods presented below exclude the costs associated with our merger with quaker  the impact of the fifty third week in  other impairment and restructuring charges and various quaker one time items and the gain on the bottling transactions in  and also reflect the impact of certain reclassifications and tax items 
in addition  comparable net sales and operating profit present the deconsolidation of our bottling operations as if it had occurred at the beginning of consolidated review net sales change b w reported    comparable    in  comparable net sales increased 
this increase is primarily due to volume gains and higher effective net pricing of worldwide snacks and worldwide beverages  as well as the acquisition of south beach beverage company  llc sobe 
these gains were partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact 
the sobe acquisition enhanced comparable net sales growth by nearly percentage point and the unfavorable foreign currency impact  primarily in brazil and europe  reduced comparable net sales growth by more than percentage point 
in  comparable net sales increased 
this increase is primarily due to volume gains and higher effective net pricing of worldwide snacks  pepsi cola north america and pepsico beverages international 
these increases were partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact  primarily in europe  which reduced comparable net sales growth by percentage point 
the fifty third week enhanced reported net sales growth by percentage point 
volume servings are based on us food and drug administration guidelines for single serving sizes of our products

in  reported bottling equity income and transaction gains and losses includes a gain on bottling transactions of billion million after tax or per share relating to the second quarter pbg and whitman bottling transactions 
the pbg transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of billion million after tax or per share 
the majority of the taxes are expected to be deferred indefinitely 
the whitman transaction resulted in an after tax loss to us of million or per share 
the pepcom transaction was accounted for as a nonmonetary exchange for book purposes
