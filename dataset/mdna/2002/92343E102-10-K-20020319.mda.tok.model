during  we completed our acquisitions of thawte consulting pty ltd and signio  inc in february and our acquisition of network solutions  inc 
in june 
in addition  we completed acquisitions of several other privately held companies  which were not significant  either individually or in the aggregate 
each of these transactions has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of the acquired companies operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  doubtful accounts  investments and long lived assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from three primary categories web presence and trust services  which include domain name registration services  web trust services and payment services  managed security and network services  which include enterprise and affiliate pki services and enterprise consulting services  and registry and telecommunications services  which include registry services  connectivity  intelligent networks  wireless and clearinghouse services 
the revenue recognition policy for each of these areas is as follows domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services 
revenues from the sale or renewal of domain name registration services are deferred and recognized ratably over the registration term  generally one to two years and up to ten years 
domain name registration renewal fees are estimated and recorded based on recent renewal and collection rates 
customers are notified of the expiration of their registration in advance  and we record the receivables for estimated renewal fees in the month preceding the anniversary date of their registration when we have a right to bill under the terms of domain name registration agreements 
the variance between the actual collections and the rate used to estimate the renewal fees is reflected in the setting of prospective renewal rates 
fees for renewals and advance extensions to the existing term are deferred until the new incremental period commences 
these fees are then recognized ratably over the new registration term  ranging from one to ten years 
revenues from the licensing of digital certificate technology and business process technology are derived from arrangements involving multiple elements including post contract customer support  training and other services 
these licenses  which do not provide for right of return  are primarily perpetual licenses for which revenues are recognized up front once all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate  generally months 
revenues from the sale of onsite managed services are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the license  generally to months 
maintenance is bundled with onsite licenses over the license term 
we recognize revenues from issuances of digital certificates and business process licensing to verisign affiliates in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  and generally recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we define each of these four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with us 
delivery has occurred 
our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
electronic delivery is deemed to have occurred upon download by the customer from an ftp server 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
it is our policy to not provide customers the right to a refund of any portion of its license fees paid 
we may agree to extended payment terms with a foreign customer based on local customs 
generally  at least of the arrangement fees are due within one year or less 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these customary payment terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable  and revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to customers for whom there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenues are recognized as cash is collected 
we allocate revenues on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of each element 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenues to maintenance and support service  professional services and training components of our perpetual license arrangements 
we sell our professional services and training separately  and have established vsoe on this basis 
vsoe for maintenance and support is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for these elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop we recognize revenues from licenses in which maintenance is bundled with the software license  such as for digital certificates  digital certificate provisioning and onsite managed services ratably over the license term of one to three years 
our consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and implementation and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to provide these services 
software products are billed separately and independently from consulting services  which are generally billed on a time and materials or milestone achieved basis 
we generally recognize revenues from consulting services as the services are performed 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized using the percentage of completion method for fixed fee development arrangements or as the services are provided for time and materials arrangements 
revenues from third party product sales are recognized when title to the products sold passes to the customer 
our shipping terms generally dictate that the passage of title occurs upon shipment of the products to the customer 
revenues from payment services primarily consist of a set up fee and a monthly service fee for the transaction processing services 
in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues from the set up fee are deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned 
revenues from the service fees are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided 
advance customer deposits received are deferred and allocated ratably to revenue over the periods the services are provided 
revenues from telecommunications services are comprised of network connectivity revenues and intelligent network services revenues 
network connectivity revenues are derived from establishing and maintaining connection to our ss network and trunk signaling services 
revenues from network connectivity consist primarily of monthly recurring fees  and trunk signaling service revenues are charged monthly based on the number of switches to which a customer signals 
the initial connection fee and related costs are deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement 
intelligent network services  which include calling card validation  local number portability  wireless services  toll free database access and caller identification are derived primarily from database administration and database query services and are charged on a per use or per query basis 
prepaid wireless account management services and unregistered wireless roaming services are based on the revenue we retain and recognized in the period in which we process such calls on a per minute or per call basis 
clearinghouse services revenues are derived primarily from serving as a distribution and collection point for billing information and payment collection for services provided by one carrier to customers billed by another 
clearinghouse revenues are earned based on the number of messages processed 
on occasion  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from organizations such as ibm  oracle  phoenix technologies and infospace at or about the same time that we licensed our software to these organizations 
these transactions are recorded at terms we consider to be fair value 
for these reciprocal arrangements  we consider accounting principles board abp opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 interpretation of apb opinion no 
 to determine whether the arrangement is a monetary or nonmonetary transaction 
transactions involving the exchange of boot representing or greater of the fair value of the reciprocal arrangement are considered monetary transactions within the context of apb opinion no 
and eitf issue no 
monetary transactions and nonmonetary transactions that represent the culmination of an earnings process are recorded at the fair value of the products delivered or products or services received  whichever is more readily determinable  providing the fair values are determinable within reasonable limits 
in determining the fair values  we consider the recent history of cash sales of the same products or services in similar sized transactions 
revenues from such transactions may be recognized over a period of time as the products or services are received 
for nonmonetary reciprocal arrangements that do not represent the culmination of the earnings process  the exchange is recorded based on the carrying value of the products delivered  which is generally zero 
in  we recognized revenues under reciprocal arrangements of approximately million  of which million involved nonmonetary transactions  as defined above 
we did not recognize any revenues under reciprocal arrangements as defined above in and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for any build up of concentration to any one customer  industry or geographic region 
to date our receivables have not had any particular concentrations that  if not collected  would have a significant impact on our operating income 
we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
investments we invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
some of these companies are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
however  in most instances  these investments are in the form of equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market 
these companies are typically in the early stage of development and may be expected to incur substantial losses 
therefore  these companies may never become publicly traded companies 
even if they do  an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments 
further  if these companies are not successful  we could incur charges related to write downs or write offs of these types of assets 
we review our marketable equity holdings in publicly traded companies on a regular basis to determine if any security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
we consider the investee company s cash position  earnings and revenue outlook  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity and management ownership  among other factors  in our review 
if we determine that an other than temporary decline exists in a marketable equity security  we write down the investment to its market value and record the related write down as an investment loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
for non public companies  we regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts based on information requested from these privately held companies 
generally  this information may be more limited  may not be as timely and may be less accurate than information available from publicly traded companies 
assessing each investment s carrying value requires significant judgment by management 
if we determine that an other than temporary decline exists in a non public equity security  we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related write down as an investment loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
generally  if cash balances are insufficient to sustain the company s operations for a six month period  we consider the decline in fair value to be other than temporary 
during  we determined that the decline in value of certain of our public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and recorded a write down of these investments totaling million 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill and other intangible assets and property and equipment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
those cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale of an acquisition at the end of its goodwill amortization period 
estimating these cash flows and terminal values requires management to make judgments about the growth in demand for our services  sustainability of gross margins  our ability to integrate acquired companies and achieve economies of scale  and valuation multiples required by investors or buyers 
changes in these estimates could require us to further write down the carrying amount of our long lived assets 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
effective january   we will assess impairment of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step test be performed 
first  the fair value of each of our reporting units will be compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  then the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
results of operations we have experienced substantial net losses in the past substantially due to the charges we incurred for the amortization and write down of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  primarily due to the amortization and write down of goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately billion related to our acquisitions 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized to earnings commencing january  instead goodwill will be reviewed for impairment as of january  and annually thereafter  or more often if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
amortization of other intangible assets is expected to be approximately million per quarter in  including the impact of all acquisitions through december   excluding the impact of ho systems and assuming no other acquisitions or impairment charges 
we accounted for all of our acquisitions in and as purchase business combinations 
accordingly  the acquired companies revenues  costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition 
as a result of our acquisitions of thawte and signio in february  network solutions in june and illuminet in december  comparisons of revenues  costs and expenses for the year ended december  to the years ended december  and may not be relevant  as the businesses of the combined company were not equivalent

the increases were primarily due to the acquisition of network solutions in june sales of authentication services  particularly web site digital certificates and enterprise and affiliate pki services  also increased 
in addition  we expanded the verisign trust network of worldwide affiliates and saw increased demand for our training and consulting services 
the increase in revenues in from is primarily due to the acquisitions of thawte  signio and network solutions 
in addition  we increased sales of our authentication services  particularly our web site digital certificates and enterprise and affiliate pki services  expanded our international affiliate network and delivered more training and consulting services 
in  we derived of our total revenues from reciprocal arrangements 
we derived no revenues from customers from reciprocal arrangements in and typically in these relationships  under separate agreements  we sell our products and services to a company and that company sells to us their products and services 
we enter into these arrangements for strategic business purposes and the goods and services we receive in exchange are those we would have purchased in non reciprocal arrangements 
these arrangements are independent relationships and are not terminable unless the terms of the agreements are violated 
we derived in  in and in of our total revenues from customers with whom we have participated in a private equity round of financing  including several of the verisign affiliates as well as various technology companies in a variety of related market areas 
typically in these relationships  under separate agreements  we sell our products and services to a company and  under a separate agreement  participate with other investors in a private equity round financing of the company 
we typically make our investments with others where our investment is less than of the total financing round 
our policy is not to recognize revenue in excess of other investors financing of the company 
these arrangements are independent relationships and are not terminable unless the terms of the agreements are violated 
enterprise and service provider division enterprise and service provider division revenues from external customers were million in  million in and million in in  revenues from the managed security and network services product line increased approximately million  to million in from million in the revenue increase was primarily due to increases in onsite services sold  software licenses sold to the new affiliate service providers  an increase in royalties earned from existing affiliates  and an overall increase in the volume of consulting services that included the resale of third party products 
third party software and hardware sales are generally made at lower margins than our other enterprise and mass market sales 
in  revenues from registry and telecommunications services increased approximately million  to million in from million in this increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of a full year of registry services revenue compared to approximately seven months in  as a result of the acquisition of network solutions in june revenues related to outsourced managed registry services also increased 
the verisign global registry services group managed approximately million domain names at december  in the active zone file for all domain names ending in

the global registry services group also processed the renewal  extension or transfer of million domain names during  bringing the total number of paid domain name transactions during to million 
mass market division mass market division revenues from external customers were million in  million in and zero in in  the increase in revenues in the mass market division was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of revenues from web presence services compared to approximately seven months in as a result of the acquisition of network solutions in june during  we added approximately million new domain names and renewed or extended an additional million domain names bringing the total active domain names under management by the registrar to approximately million at december   which does not include approximately million domain names past their anniversary dates that have been deactivated from the zone files but not yet deleted from the web presence services whois database 
in  the demand for new domain name registrations in our web presence business increased substantially as a result of our promotional programs and from registrations by entities who registered domain names with the hopes of reselling them 
many of those promotional and speculator domain names have not been renewed and have already been deactivated from the active zone file maintained by the verisign global registry 
in addition  due to the competitive market in domain names  we have experienced moderate price declines in sales prices for domain names 
we expect that this situation will continue 
our mass markets division and our enterprise and service provider division issued approximately  new and renewed web site digital certificates in compared to  in and  in the total installed base was over  certificates at december  in particular  the mass markets division web site certificate base increased by  installed certificates in to a total of  certificates at december  the increase in sales of web site digital certificates in contributed approximately million to the increase in revenues 
in addition  due to increased competition in the web trust services market  we have experienced moderate pricing pressure for our services 
we expect that this pricing pressure will continue 
international revenues revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates accounted for of total revenues in  in and in the percentage decrease in revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates in compared to and was primarily related to the acquisition in june of network solutions  whose revenues are primarily attributable to us sources 
this was partially offset by additional revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates in related to an increase in the number of verisign affiliates in the verisign trust network combined with other activities to expand our presence in foreign markets 
in  we began our international affiliate program under which we signed agreements with local telecommunications companies  financial institutions and others to promote  sell and distribute our pki services in international markets around the world 
these verisign affiliates typically require significant capital development  the cost of which is borne by the affiliate 
our strategy from time to time also includes investing in certain affiliates in strategic markets that represent advantageous economic opportunities for a minority interest of less than 
as a result  we have invested in several international affiliates in and prior years 
revenues from verisign affiliates in which we have invested accounted for of total revenues in  in and in costs and expenses cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services  payment services  domain name registration services  customer support and training  consulting and development services and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities 
in addition  with respect to our digital certificate services  cost of revenues also includes fees paid to third parties to verify certificate applicants identities  insurance premiums for our service warranty plan  errors and omission insurance and the cost of software and hardware resold to customers 
a comparison of cost of revenues for the years ended december   and is presented below 
change change dollars in thousands cost of revenues    percentage of revenues growth of revenues was the primary factor in the increase of cost of revenues in from and in from we hired more employees to support the growth of demand for our products and services and to support the growth of our consulting and training services 
we incurred increased expenses for access to third party databases to verify digital certificate applicants identities  increased customer service costs related to our larger customer base and increased expenses related to the cost of hardware and software products resold to customers as part of our consulting business 
we anticipate that cost of revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of continued growth in all of our lines of business 
our acquisitions of thawte  signio and network solutions have resulted in an increase in our cost of revenues since their acquisitions in our recent acquisitions of illuminet in december and ho systems in february will further increase the dollar amount of our cost of revenues 
future acquisitions  further expansion into international markets and introduction of new products will result in additional increases in cost of revenues  due to the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses and other factors 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased slightly in from  primarily due to the cost structure of the network solutions product mix and the increase in the volume of third party hardware and software sales  which was partially offset by economies of scale associated with the growth in recurring revenues from existing customers 
the decrease in from was primarily a result of the continued realization of economies of scale from our technology infrastructure and the efficiency gains in the certificate enrollment and issuance process 
certain of our services  such as consulting and training  require greater initial personnel involvement and therefore have higher costs than other types of services 
in addition  revenues derived from our authentication services  domain name registration services  registry services  payment services and our telecommunications services as a result of our recent acquisition of illuminet each have different cost structures 
as a result  we anticipate that cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will increase in the near term 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing  and policy activities 
these expenses include salaries  sales commissions and other personnel related expenses  travel and related expenses  trade shows  costs of lead generation  costs of computer and communications equipment and support services  facilities costs  consulting fees and costs of marketing programs  such as internet  television  radio and print advertising

web addresses as well as value added services including web site design tools and other enhanced service offerings 
the remainder of the increase in both periods was driven by lead and demand generation activities in our enterprise and affiliate pki businesses  expansion of our sales force and an increase in international sales expenses 
the increase in from also reflects the effect of sales and marketing expenses from thawte and signio 
while the absolute dollar spending increased for sales and marketing expenses  we continue to realize a decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues over the three year period 
this is primarily due to the increase in recurring revenues from existing customers  which tend to have lower retention costs and the increase in the productivity of our direct and inside sales forces 
however  we cannot forecast that these sales and marketing expenses will continue to decline as a percentage of revenues 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis in the future  primarily related to an expanded sales force  expanded marketing and demand generation activities  development and enhancement of partner and distribution channels and promotional activities for web presence products and services 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel  including salaries and other personnel related expenses  consulting fees and the costs of facilities  computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and technology development

change change dollars in thousands research and development    percentage of revenues 
research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in from and in from primarily due to the acquisition of network solutions in june the increases in both periods relate to the development and enhancement of new registry products related to multilingual domain names and managed domain name system services 
in addition  we continued to invest in the design  testing and deployment of  and technical support for our expanded digital trust service offerings and technology 
we also expanded our engineering staff and incurred related costs required to support our continued emphasis on developing new products and services as well as enhancing existing products and services 
some of the new products and services developed during include our entitlement management services  authentication service bureau and digital trust services platform 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues in from and in from is largely due to the fact that revenues increased faster than research and development expenses in these periods 
we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to decline in future periods 
we believe that timely development of new and enhanced enterprise services  payment services  web presence services and other technologies are necessary to maintain our position in the marketplace 
accordingly  we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development 
as a result  we expect research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
to date  we have expensed all research and development expenditures as incurred 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses for our executive  administrative  legal  finance and human resources personnel  facilities and computer and communications equipment  management information systems  support services  professional services fees and bad debt expense

change change dollars in thousands general and administrative    percentage of revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses in from and in over was primarily related to the acquisition of network solutions in june expenses also increased in from  as well as in from  due to additional staffing levels required to manage and support our expanded operations  the implementation of additional management information systems and the expansion of our corporate headquarters 
in addition  our bad debt expense increased to million in from million in and 
million in  primarily as a result of increased revenues and deterioration in the overall economy in the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in from and in from is primarily due to incremental expenses related to integrating our acquisitions and different cost structures of those acquisitions 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis in the future as we expand our administrative and executive staff  add infrastructure  expand facilities and assimilate acquired technologies and businesses 
write off of acquired in process research and development the portion of the network solutions purchase price allocated to in process research and development  or ipr d  was million and was expensed during the quarter ended june  network solutions ipr d efforts focused on significant and substantial improvements and upgrades to its shared registration system  or srs

com  
net  and

it is through this system that registrars from all over the world are able to register domain names with the central database 
given the high demand on the srs  it was in need of improvements and upgrades in the area of scalability  security  non english language capability and next generation resource provisioning protocol 
as of the acquisition date  network solutions was in the process of developing technology that would add substantial functionality and features to the srs 
the ipr d had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the technological feasibility of the in process development efforts is established when the enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the technology can be utilized to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
the development efforts related to upgrades and improvements in the srs and other systems were completed in the first quarter of the fair value assigned to ipr d was estimated by discounting  to present value  the cash flows attributable to the technology once it reached technological feasibility 
a discount rate of was used to estimate the present value of cash flows 
the value assigned to ipr d was the amount attributable to the efforts of network solutions up to the time of acquisition 
this amount was estimated through application of the stage of completion calculation by multiplying the estimated present value of future cash flows  excluding costs of completion  by the percentage of completion of the purchased research and development project at the time of acquisition 
amortization and write down of goodwill and other intangible assets during  we completed several acquisitions including thawte  signio and network solutions 
these acquisitions resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets in the amount of billion 
our policy is to assess the recoverability of goodwill using estimated undiscounted cash flows 
those cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale of an acquisition at the end of its goodwill amortization period 
though the acquisitions have been predominantly performing at or above expectations  market conditions and attendant multiples used to estimate terminal values have continued to remain depressed 
at june   the nasdaq market index was at  points and had decreased  points  or  to  points at june  this decline affected the analysis used to assess the recoverability of goodwill 
for goodwill associated with thawte and network solutions  fair value was determined based on future operating cash flows over the remaining amortization period of the goodwill 
the terminal values were estimated based on the relationship of the value of the verisign stock issued at the acquisition date to the value of verisign s stock over the three month period preceding the valuation 
for signio and the other acquisitions  fair value was determined through the use of recent indicators of fair value such as comparable sales and multiples derived from recent acquisition activities 
as a result  management recorded an impairment charge in the quarter ended june   in the amount of billion 
since the most significant acquisitions were completed by issuing shares of our common stock  the impairment should be considered a non cash charge 
the amortization and write down of goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately billion in compared to billion in in addition to the billion write down discussed above  the increase was primarily related to our purchase acquisitions during  which accounted for approximately billion of additional goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized to earnings commencing january  instead goodwill will be reviewed for impairment annually  or more often if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
amortization of other intangible assets is expected to be approximately million per quarter thereafter  including the impact of all acquisitions through december   but excluding the impact of ho systems and assuming no other acquisitions or impairment charges 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  gains and losses on the sale or write down of equity investments  and the net effect of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
a comparison of other income for the years ended december   and is presented below 
change change dollars in thousands other income expense    percentage of revenues other expense  net  in was primarily comprised of the write down of investments totaling million on certain public and non public equity security investments  partially offset by million of interest and other income 
other income  net  in consisted primarily of a realized gain of million from the sale of shares of keynote systems  inc  and interest and other income of million 
in  we determined that the decline in value of certain of our public and non public equity securities investments was other than temporary and we recorded a write down of these investments totaling million 
we had previously valued certain of these investments at the then fair market value as part of the network solutions acquisition 
we may from time to time recognize losses or gains from the sales  write downs or write offs of our equity investments 
our cash and investments base increased significantly through the acquisition of network solutions in june  however  our invested balances produced lower returns due to lower market interest rates in as compared to the increase in from is primarily due to increased earnings on funds invested 
investments increased in part due to our net proceeds of million generated from the follow on public offering of our common stock in january and the investment of cash generated from operations 
our investment base was also significantly increased through the acquisition of network solutions  which added over million of cash and investments 
in  we also realized a million gain from the sale of shares of keynote systems  inc income tax benefit in  we recorded a million tax benefit 
the benefit is due to the realization of current net operating losses and certain current deferred tax assets 
we have not provided a benefit for the long term deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their being realized 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million related to stock compensation deductions 
we also had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million related to stock compensation deductions 
we had no net operating loss carryforwards for federal or state income tax purposes from operations 
if we are not able to use them  the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through in addition  we had available for carryover research and experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately million and for state income tax purposes of approximately million 
the federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire  if not utilized  in through state research and experimental tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation s ownership change  as defined in the internal revenue code 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of such ownership change 
we do not anticipate that any material limitation exists on our ability to use our carryforwards and credits 
our accounting for deferred taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required to be applied to certain deferred tax assets  we considered such factors as our history of operating losses  our expected current year taxable income exclusive of stock compensation deductions  our uncertainty as to the projected long term operating results  and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
although our operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods  our evaluation of all of the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the noncurrent deferred tax assets indicated that such plans were not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence 
the possible future reversal of the valuation allowance will result in future income statement benefit to the extent the valuation allowance was applied to deferred tax assets generated through ongoing operations 
to the extent the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets generated through stock compensation deductions  the possible future reversal of such valuation allowance will result in a credit to additional paid in capital and will not result in future income statement benefit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
minority interest in net income loss of subsidiary minority interest in the net income loss of verisign japan kk was 
million in  million in and 
million in the year to year changes are primarily due to verisign japan s increased revenues as compared to the prior years 
as the verisign japan business continues to develop and evolve  we expect that the minority interest in net income loss of subsidiary will fluctuate 
we disclose pro forma financial information we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
our pro forma financial information does not include the amortization and write down of goodwill and intangible assets related to acquisitions  stock based compensation charges related to acquisitions  write down of investments and benefit for income taxes 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases and compare that gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
liquidity and capital resources change dollars in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments   working capital   stockholders equity   at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  consisting principally of commercial paper  medium term corporate notes  corporate bonds and notes  market auction securities  us government and agency securities and money market funds 
in addition  we hold million of long term investments  consisting primarily of debt and equity securities of non public companies  which have no ready market 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the increase was primarily due to an overall increase in net income after adjustments for non cash items such as amortization and the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets  depreciation of property and equipment and the write down of certain investments  as well as higher levels of deferred revenue 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by increases in deferred income taxes and accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  primarily as a result of billion used for purchases of investments  which were offset by proceeds of billion from sales and maturities of investments  million used for purchases of property and equipment  including approximately million used for the purchase of the land and buildings for our corporate headquarters in california  and million paid  net of cash acquired  for business combinations 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  primarily as a result of the cash acquired in our acquisitions  partially offset by increased purchases of short and long term investments  and costs relating to our acquisitions 
in  net cash used in investing activities of million was primarily related to net purchases of investments 
capital expenditures for property and equipment totaled million in  million in and million in our planned capital expenditures for are approximately million to million  primarily for computer and communications equipment and leasehold improvements 
as of december   we also had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in in and  cash was provided primarily from common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises 
in  these proceeds were partially offset by the use of approximately million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
in  we received net cash proceeds of million from the public offering of our stock 
in april  the board authorized the use of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market  or in negotiated or block trades 
during  we repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately million 
at december   approximately million remained available for future purchases under this program 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and operating cash flows  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
an increase in the number of significant acquisitions or investments to be funded with cash may require us to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
this additional funding  if needed  might not be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could materially harm our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of our stock owned by our then current stockholders will be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
our illuminet subsidiary entered into an agreement with bank of america effective june  to provide a line of credit and a capital expenditure loan facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate bonds and notes  market auction securities  us government and agency securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
in addition  we generally invest in relatively short term securities 
as of december   of our short term investments mature in less than one year 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing in six six months months or to one more than estimated less year one year total fair value dollars in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents 
   weighted average interest rate included in short term investments      weighted average interest rate exchange rate sensitivity we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
all revenues derived from operations other than verisign japan kk  thawte south africa  registrars 
com canada  euro europe and domainnames 
com uk are denominated in united states dollars and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
both the revenues and expenses of our majority owned subsidiary in japan as well as our wholly owned subsidiaries and sales offices in south africa  europe  sweden  canada and the united kingdom are denominated in local currencies 
in these regions  we believe this serves as a natural hedge against exchange rate fluctuations because although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the united states dollar will result in lower revenues when translated to united states dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
because of our minimal exposure to foreign currencies  we have not engaged in any hedging activities  although if future events or changes in circumstances indicate that hedging activities would be beneficial  we may consider such activities 
equity price risk we own shares of common stock of several public companies 
we value these investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month 
these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value  with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
we have also invested in equity instruments of several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the startup or development stages  and therefore  carry a high level of risk 
in  we determined the decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized a million impairment loss 
due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  and in light of current stock market conditions  we may incur future losses on the sales  write downs or write offs of our investments 
we do not currently hedge against equity price changes
