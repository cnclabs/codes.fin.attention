item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
certain statements in this discussion constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may involve our plans  objectives and expectations  which are dependent upon a number of factors  including site expansions  development  acquisitions  dispositions and other new business initiatives which are all subject to a number of contingency factors such as the effects of national and local economic conditions  changes in interest rates  supply and demand for affordable housing and the condition of the capital markets that may prevent us from achieving our objectives 
overview we added  manufactured home sites to our portfolio over the three year period ended december  this includes acquisitions and dispositions of manufactured home communities  as well as our development activity 
at the end of this period  our portfolio comprised manufactured home communities containing  manufactured homesites and  park model rv sites  located in states 
we also provide property management and advisory services to n tandem trust n tandem 
n tandem owns communities with an aggregate of  homesites 
we own approximately ten percent of n tandem s outstanding equity and have made loans and advances to n tandem 
we conduct substantially all of our activities through cp limited partnership the operating partnership in which we owned a combined percent general partner interest as of december  in addition  effective january   we consolidated six development joint ventures that we control 
the effects of consolidation were not material to our financial position or results of our operations 
we also conduct manufactured home sales and brokerage activities through our taxable subsidiary community sales  inc csi 
company growth since the beginning of can be attributed to community acquisitions  increased operating performance at existing communities  community expansions  and new community development  offset somewhat by property dispositions 
on august   we purchased cws communities trust cws  a private real estate investment trust for approximately million 
the portfolio consisted of manufactured home communities with approximately  homesites and approximately  expansion sites and three rv communities with rv sites in states 
this transaction extended our leading position in the manufactured housing community sector  making us substantially larger than our next largest reit competitor in that sector 
since our organization  we have elected to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code and thus do not generally pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings to the extent that such earnings are distributed to shareholders in accordance with reit requirements 
historical results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table summarizes certain information relative to our properties  as of and for the years ended december  and we consider all communities owned by us at both january  and december   as the core portfolio

on a per site basis  weighted monthly rental revenue for the year ended december  was compared with for the same period in  an increase of percent 
management fee and other income primarily include management fee and transaction fee income for the management of manufactured home communities and equity earnings from csi 
property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended december  increased by  or percent from the prior year 
the majority of the increase was due to the acquisition of cws  along with increased bad debt and collection costs of approximately  and operating expense increases in our core portfolio 
the increase in bad debt expense was due to economic conditions as well as the implementation of our enterprise wide technology solution 
in many of our market areas the economic conditions have created a more difficult than normal collections environment  which has significantly impacted the cost of collections  as well the overall ability to collect past due amounts 
in addition  difficulties encountered related to the implementation and utilization of our enterprise wide technology solution  which was initiated in the last quarter of  was also a factor in the unusually high expense recognized in the majority of problems were isolated to less than percent of our communities  and we are working diligently to bring the collections performance of these locations in line with the rest of the portfolio 
although we believe that these issues have been substantially resolved  we will continue to monitor the collections performance of each community as well as to improve operational processes to ensure timely billing and collection of delinquent accounts 
real estate taxes for the year ended december  increased by  or percent from the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to acquisitions  expansion of communities  and increases in property tax rates

administrative expense in was percent of total revenues as compared to percent in interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended december  by  as compared with the year ended december  the increase is attributed primarily to the indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions and lending activities 
interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding decreased to approximately percent in from percent in  due to lower interest rates  and greater amounts of variable rate debt 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  increased  from the same period a year ago 
the increase is directly attributed to acquisitions  expansions  and additions of rental property 
depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable rental property in remained relatively unchanged from comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table summarizes certain information relative to our properties  as of and for the years ended december  and we consider all communities owned by us at both january  and december  as the core portfolio

depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable rental property in remained relatively unchanged from liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to increases in net operating income  offset by the changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
in  we purchased cws communities trust cws  a private real estate investment trust for a net amount of approximately million and three additional communities for million in cash 
we also sold seven properties and received net proceeds of million in the latter part of total investments in development  expansion  and property and equipment were million in and we advanced million on our notes receivables 
on august  we purchased cws for million  consisting of million borrowed under a bridge facility  million in assumed liabilities   op units valued for purposes of the transaction at per op unit and million in senior unsecured notes due the august notes 
the portfolio consisted of manufactured home communities with approximately  homesites and approximately  expansion sites and three rv communities with rv sites in states 
we financed the cash portion of this transaction primarily through borrowings of a million bridge facility the acquisition facility  which carries an interest rate of libor plus basis points  and matures august  in connection with this transaction  we agreed to issue in a private placement to the holders of the august notes  an aggregate of  op units at per op unit  in exchange for the issuance by such holders of notes  due august  subject to extension in certain events 
these notes are collateralized by the related op units 
we also acquired three other communities in for approximately million in op units and approximately million in cash  which were financed primarily by borrowings under our lines of credit 
during  we invested approximately million in the expansion and development of our communities  resulting in the addition of approximately available sites to our portfolio in  and including finish costs on sites added previously and substantial progress on sites that will be added to our portfolio in for the year ended december   recurring property capital expenditures  other than development costs  were approximately million 
capital expenditures have historically been financed out of operating cash flow and it is our intention that such future expenditures will also be financed out of operating cash flow 
in addition  during  we advanced million to non affiliated entities that own or are developing manufactured home communities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this consisted primarily of the issuance of million of debt and net borrowings under our credit facilities and the acquisition facility of million 
these were offset partially by million in dividends and distributions paid to shareholders and op unitholders 
on october   we issued million of senior unsecured notes  due in a private placement 
net proceeds of million were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the acquisition facility 
in connection with the private placement  we entered into a hedge of forecasted interest payments 
we recorded a hedge loss of approximately million in other comprehensive income and will amortize this into interest expense over the life of the debt 
in october  we extended million of our million senior unsecured notes scheduled to mature in november to october at 
in addition to the acquisition facility  we have a million line of credit arrangement with bankone  na acting as lead agent for a bank group to provide financing for future construction  acquisitions and general business obligations the bankone credit facility 
the line of credit is unsecured  bears interest at the prime rate of interest or  at our option  libor plus basis points 
the line is scheduled to mature in in addition  we have a million unsecured line of credit from us bank  which bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points and matures in march  which is under discussion for an extension  the us bank facility and  together with the bankone credit facility the credit facilities 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding under our credit facilities and we had million available in additional borrowing capacity 
as of december   we had outstanding  in addition to the credit facilities  million of unsecured senior debt with a weighted average interest rate and remaining maturity of percent and years  respectively  million of secured mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate and remaining maturity of percent and years  respectively  and million on our acquisition facility with an interest rate of percent 
as of december   we had approximately billion of total debt outstanding  representing approximately percent of our total market capitalization 
all of the debt is fixed rate debt  other than our credit facilities and acquisition facility 
the fixed rate debt carries a weighted average interest rate of percent 
in the third quarter of  we began implementing a disposition plan  identifying a number of properties that do not fit strategically with our overall investment portfolio  due to location  proximity to other properties  alternative investment opportunities or other factors 
as of december   we had sold seven properties for approximately million 
the net proceeds from these sales  of approximately million were used primarily to pay down the acquisition facility 
due to the timing of these sales  approximately million was received in january of since december   we have sold an additional three properties for approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to pay down the acquisition facility 
as of march   we had million outstanding under the acquisition facility and million available under our credit facilities 
we will continue to evaluate our properties and  depending on market conditions  expect to sell additional communities in we expect to re pay the balance of the acquisition facility  which matures in august of  depending on current market conditions and capital availability factors  with proceeds from the disposition of properties  and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
our principal long term liquidity needs include repayment of long term borrowings and amounts outstanding under the credit facilities and the acquisition facility  future acquisitions of communities and land for development  and new and existing community development activities 
we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to finance these long term liquidity needs and instead intend to meet our long term liquidity requirements through additional borrowing under the credit facilities or other lines of credit  the assumption of existing secured or unsecured indebtedness and  depending on market conditions and capital availability factors  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements  including expansion activities and capital expenditure requirements  through cash flow from operations and  if necessary  and depending on our operating performance  borrowings under the credit facilities and other lines of credit 
the following is a summary of our aggregate commitments  in millions  as of december  payments due by period contractual less than obligations total year years years after years fixed rate debt variable rate debt amount of commitment expiration per period total other commercial amounts less than commitments committed year years years after years lines of credit guarantees these guarantees expire at various times 
the financing arrangements contain customary covenants  including a debt service coverage ratio and a restriction on the incurrence of additional collateralized indebtedness without a corresponding increase in rental property 
we were out of compliance on one of our covenants as of december  associated with both our bankone credit facility and the acquisition facility 
also  in february  we were out of compliance on another of our covenants under both agreements that limit the amount of variable rate debt outstanding 
in february  we received waivers from the lenders and amended the agreements to change the covenant for the remaining term of the acquisition facility and until march for the credit facility 
in march  moody s investor service lowered our debt rating to baa from baa the reason for the change was due to a weaker capital structure and coverage ratios since completing the cws acquisition 
standard and poors has not changed its rating of bbb 
in the event that our debt rating is lowered again  it may have an impact on the cost of our debt 
we currently own approximately percent of n tandem s outstanding stock and account for our investment utilizing the equity method of accounting 
we also recognize income from a property management agreement  an advisory agreement  overhead reimbursements and interest income on advances as earned 
the amount of fee income and interest income earned is outlined in the table below 
interest income and related fees    transaction fees   advisory fees  management and overhead fees    interest is earned on the loan to n tandem prime plus one percent  or percent at december  and includes fees paid by n tandem for the subordination of our loan to the n tandem bank debt  in both and 
the transaction fees are related to acquisition services provided by us to n tandem and are calculated as three percent of the acquisition price 
the advisory fees are charged based on one percent of n tandem s average assets 
the management fees are charged based on five percent of revenues of properties managed by us on behalf of n tandem 
overhead reimbursement fees are based on a fixed fee per site 
we expect to receive modest increases on the recurring fees due to increases in expected revenues and sites 
however  as the non recurring fees are subject to the completion of a transaction  these are difficult to predict 
n tandem currently has net losses of approximately million for the year ended december  and also has experienced negative cash flows from operations 
we serve as a guarantor on n tandem s million line of credit 
we do not have any agreements to fund future operating losses of n tandem  however our ability to recover our fees charged to n tandem and our loans and advances to n tandem is dependent on the ultimate sale of the n tandem properties 
n tandem will likely continue to generate negative cash flow from operations in the near term 
we believe that based on current market conditions the loans and advances to n tandem  which totaled approximately million at december   will be recovered from the ultimate sale of the properties 
the following table summarizes certain financial information for n tandem for the years ending december  and total revenues   operating and administrative expenses   interest expense   depreciation expense   preferred dividends net loss   rental property   total assets   amounts due to the company   other debt   shareholders deficit   critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following section is a summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies that both require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported on our consolidated financial statements 

when we acquire real estate properties  we allocate the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between land and different categories of land improvements as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions 
these allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or losses recorded on future sales of properties 

we recognize an impairment loss on a real estate asset to be held and used in operations if the asset s undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than its depreciated cost 
we compute a real estate assets undiscounted expected future cash flow using certain estimates and assumptions 

we use two different accounting methods to report our investments in entities the consolidation method and the equity method 
we use the consolidation method when we own most of the outstanding voting interests in an entity and or can control its operations 
we use the equity method of accounting when we own an interest in an entity and can exert significant influence over the entity s operations but cannot control the entity s operations 
we review these investments regularly for possible impairment using certain estimates and assumptions regarding undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we also review these investments regularly for proper accounting treatment 
however  a key factor in this review  the determination of whether or not we can control or exert significant influence over an entity s operations  is subjective in nature 

we report receivables net of an allowance for receivables that may be uncollectible in the future 
we review our receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance recorded against our receivables  this review process requires we make certain judgments regarding collections that are inherently difficult to predict 

collectibility of advances to n tandem and other notes receivable is based on the determination of the fair market value of the properties and the related net proceeds from the ultimate liquidation of the properties 
inflation all of the leases or terms of tenants occupancies at the communities allow for at least annual rental adjustments 
in addition  all leases are short term generally one year or less and enable us to seek market rentals upon reletting the sites 
such leases generally minimize the risk to us of any adverse effect of inflation 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations to be accounted for by the purchase method and defines criteria under which intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
changes the useful life of goodwill recorded on a company s books from years to indefinite and requires goodwill to be reviewed annually for impairment 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of sfas no 
and no 
did not have and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment on disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and provides guidance for measuring the amount of impairment 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as individual properties to be sold qualify as components of an entity  properties classified as held for sale or sold in a reporting period will be treated as discontinued operations for reporting purposes 
the statement of income will reflect the properties results of operations  including any gains or losses recognized  as a separate component in the income statement 
other funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as consolidated net income without giving effect to gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property and rental property depreciation and amortization 
management believes that ffo is an important and widely used measure of the operating performance of reits  which provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
ffo i does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  ii should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  iii is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity  and iv may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
ffo is calculated as follows for the year ended december  in thousands income before minority interests    less income allocated to preferred op units    plus depreciation of rental property    amortization of intangibles impairment gain on sales of properties   funds from operations    item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
management has and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level and taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long term debt and or equity 
as of december   our credit and acquisition facilities represented our only variable rate debt 
the following table sets forth information as of december   concerning our debt obligations  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value fv for the year ended december  thereafter total fv debt obligations fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate total debt         we face market risk relating to our fixed rate debt upon re financing of such debt and depending upon prevailing interest rates at the time of such re finance 
as a result of our successful re financing and extension of our fixed rate debt  as illustrated in the above chart  we will not need to re finance any of our fixed rate debt until our acquisition facility matures in august of we expect to re pay the balance  depending on current market conditions and capital availability factors  with proceeds from the disposition of properties  a bank term loan  or the issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
in addition  we have assessed the market risk for our variable rate debt and believe that a increase in libor rates would result in an approximate million increase in interest expense based on million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration
