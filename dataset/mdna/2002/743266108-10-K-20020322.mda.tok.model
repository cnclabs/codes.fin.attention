risk elements the following table details the company s underperforming assets at december for the years indicated at december  loans and leases accounted for on a non accrual basis      reo  net of related reserves   total non performing assets      accruing loans or more days past due      total underperforming assets      non performing assets as a percentage of net loans and leases and real estate owned

underperforming assets as a percentage of net loans and leases and real estate owned underperforming assets as a percentage of total assets gross interest income that would have been recorded during  and if the company s non accrual loans and leases at the end of such periods had been performing in accordance with their terms during such periods was   and  respectively 
the amount of interest income that was actually recorded during  and with respect to such non accrual loans and leases amounted to approximately   and  respectively 
the million of non accrual loans and leases at december  consists of  of loans secured by first liens on single family residential property   of loans secured by commercial property  million of commercial business loans of which million were loans to pre profit companies   of consumer loans and million of lease financing 
the largest underperforming customer had an aggregate non accrual loan balance of million that was participated to the bank  secured by accounts receivable and business assets 
the customer has been current in its payments to the bank but has been identified by shared national institutional credit as a non accrual credit at the lead bank 
the second largest underperforming customer had an aggregate non accrual loan balance of million  secured by accounts receivable and business assets 
while both customers continue to make payments  the ultimate collectibility of all principal and interest is uncertain 
the accrual of interest on commercial loans  mortgage loans and leases is generally discontinued when the loans and leases become days past due and when  in management s judgement  it is determined that a reasonable doubt exists as to collectibility 
the accrual of interest is also discontinued on residential and consumer loans when such loans become days past due  except for those loans in the process of collection which are secured by cash collateral or by real estate with a loan to value less than for first mortgage loans and less than for second mortgage loans 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current income 
additional interest collected on such loans is recorded as a contra against the principal balance and only recorded into interest income if the loan is returned to an accruing status 
a loan remains on non accrual status until the factors which indicate doubtful collectibility no longer exist  or the loan is liquidated  or when the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
all loans and leases are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on non accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the collection of additional interest is deemed insufficient to warrant further accrual 
in addition to the loans classified as underperforming at december   other loans with a total principal balance of million were identified by management to be possible problem loans 
while these borrowers are in compliance with present repayment terms  their financial conditions have caused management to believe that their loans may result in classification as past due or non accrual at some future time 
these loans have been considered in the recognition of impaired loans described below 
in  the company adopted the provisions of sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended by sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
under the company s credit policy  all loans  except for leases  residential mortgages  and consumer loans  are subject to impairment recognition on a monthly basis 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that all principal and interest due under the contractual terms of a loan will not be collected 
the company generally considers most loans days or more past due and all non accrual loans to be impaired 
loan impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the fair value of an impaired loan is less than its recorded investment  a specific valuation allowance is allocated to the loan 
interest income on impaired loans other than non accrual loans  is recorded on an accrual basis 
the following table sets forth the recorded investment in impaired loans and the related valuation allowance for each loan category as of december  and amount in the amount in the recorded recorded investment in investment in impaired loans impaired loans total for which there for which there recorded is a related is no related investment in amount of allowance for allowance for the impaired allowance for loan losses loan losses loans loan losses at december  commercial business    commercial real estate   construction total    at december  commercial business   commercial real estate   construction total   primarily all of the impaired loans were measured based on the fair value of collateral 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
interest income recognized on impaired loans totaled  for   for and  for the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable with the amount of underperforming loans previously disclosed 
the primary differences between underperforming loans and impaired loans are i all loan categories are considered in determining underperforming loans while impaired loan recognition is limited to commercial business loans  commercial real estate loans and construction loans  and ii impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due and non accrual loans but also may include possible problem loans other than delinquent loans 
at december   the balance of impaired loans included non accrual loans of million and loans days or more past due of  at december   the balance of impaired loans included non accrual loans of million and loans days or more past due of million

total    concentrations of credit risk the company extends credit through loans and leases in the normal course of business to its customers  a significant number of whom operate or reside within southeastern pennsylvania and surrounding business areas 
the ability of its customers to meet contractual obligations is  to some extent  dependent upon the conditions of this regional economy 
in addition  certain groups of borrowers share characteristics which  given current economic conditions may affect their ability to meet contractual obligations 
these customers and their credit extensions at december   include retail consumers that account for of all credit extensions  commercial mortgages and construction that account for  residential construction that account for  and commercial business that accounts for 
summary of loan and lease loss experience the following table details the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses to the various categories at the dates indicated 
the allocation is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses will occur  and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses in any category of loans or leases

an allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for potential losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based upon examination of the portfolio  past loss experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions  the results of the most recent regulatory examinations  and other relevant factors 
while management uses the best information available to make such evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making such evaluations

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management the major objectives of the company s asset and liability management are to manage exposure to changes in the interest rate environment  to ensure adequate liquidity and funding  to preserve and build capital  and to maximize net interest income opportunities 
the company manages these objectives through its asset liability and investment committee 
the committee meets monthly to develop strategies that affect the future level of net interest income  liquidity and capital 
the committee utilizes cash flow forecasts  considers current economic conditions and the direction of interest rates  and manages the bank s risk to such changes 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to be liability sensitive  or as having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  an institution is considered to be asset sensitive  or as having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing is less than the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing during the same period 
generally  in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap should result in an increase in net interest income  and in a rising interest rate environment  a negative gap should adversely affect net interest income 
the converse would be true for a positive gap 
however  shortcomings are inherent in a simplified gap analysis that may result in an institution with a nominally negative gap having interest rate behavior associated with an asset sensitive balance sheet 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have a similar maturity or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating gap 
management believes that the simulation of net interest income in different interest rate environments provides a more meaningful measure of interest rate risk 
simulation analysis incorporates the potential of all assets and liabilities to mature or reprice as well as the probability that they will do so 
simulation in net interest income over a two year period also incorporates the relative interest rate sensitivities of these items  and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
finally  simulation analysis permits management to assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates  but also of proposed strategies for responding to them 
the company s simulation model analyzes interest rate sensitivity by projecting net interest income over the next months in a flat rate scenario 
the flat rate model projects growth in the loan portfolio and projects the mix of accounts within the loan portfolio 
in addition  the company must also make certain assumptions regarding the movement of the rates on its assets and liabilities  especially its deposit rates 
the company projects net interest income in a rising rate scenario of basis points over a month period as well as a basis point decrease in a declining rate scenario during this same period 
the company then determines its interest rate sensitivity by calculating the difference in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios versus the flat rate scenario 
based on this analysis at december  the company would experience an approximate increase in net interest income over a one year period if rates rise basis points in comparison to a flat rate scenario and an approximate decrease in net interest income if rates decline basis points 
the following table presents the anticipated maturities or repricing of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for various time periods based on the information and the assumptions set forth in the notes below

loan balances have been reduced for non accrual loans  which amounted to million at december  interest earning assets do not include loan loss reserves  deferred loan fees  and mark to market adjustment on available for sale securities 
loans held for sale are included in the three month time period commercial business of million and commercial real estate of million 
money market deposits  savings accounts  and now accounts are estimated in terms of repricing and balance sensitivity  the estimates are necessarily subjective due to the indeterminate maturity of the accounts 
deposits that are part of the loan sale are included in the three month time period
