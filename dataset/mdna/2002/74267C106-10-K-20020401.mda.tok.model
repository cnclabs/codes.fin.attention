item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the payment of losses and lae and operating expenses in the ordinary course of business and debt service are currently proassurance s principal need for liquid funds 
during  cash provided by operating activities was sufficient to meet those needs  and proassurance believes those sources will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
proassurance believes that its reserves for losses and lae are adequate to discharge outstanding contractual liabilities 
on june   medical assurance and professionals group became wholly owned subsidiaries of proassurance  a newly formed holding company 
the consolidation of medical assurance and professionals group under proassurance is described in note to proassurance s consolidated financial statements 
the cash required for the consolidation was million  which proassurance derived from internal funds generated from dividends paid by medical assurance and professionals group at the time of closing and the proceeds of a million term loan 
the term loan was obtained pursuant to a credit agreement with the lending banks  a copy of which was filed as an exhibit to the proassurance form k a filed with the sec on may  the credit agreement includes a million revolving line of credit available for proassurance s working capital and operating requirements  including debt service 
see note to proassurance s consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the terms of the credit agreement  including the financial covenants 
proassurance is  and anticipates it will be  in compliance with all loan covenants during the next months 
the cash required for the consolidation was less than originally anticipated by management because fewer than expected professionals group shareholders elected to receive an all cash distribution instead of electing to receive cash and stock 
proassurance made a million prepayment against the term loan in september  and also made the two required quarterly repayments of million 
proassurance s long term debt is held and serviced by the parent holding company  proassurance  and it currently has sufficient funds in its direct non insurance subsidiaries to meet its debt service requirements for proassurance s future cash requirements will be funded principally by dividends from its insurance subsidiaries  which may require regulatory approval 
proassurance repurchased approximately  of its shares during leaving a total of million shares remaining from stock repurchase authorizations granted to medical assurance prior to the consolidation 
these authorizations will be used to repurchase proassurance shares 
as discussed in detail in item  under the caption of general  on march  meemic holdings announced that it intends to acquire all of its outstanding shares of stock not currently owned by proassurance for per share in cash a total of  fully diluted shares  for a total possible purchase price of million 
if the transaction is successfully completed  meemic holdings intends to primarily use its own existing cash resources to fund the purchase of the shares 
the transaction is subject to numerous contingencies as discussed in item and in item results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview proassurance operates in the united states of america in two reportable insurance industry segments professional liability and personal lines 
proassurance s professional liability insurance segment principally provides professional liability insurance and reinsurance for providers of health care services  and  to a limited extent  providers of legal services 
this segment is principally made up of its three operating insurance subsidiaries ma alabama  pronational and ma west virginia 
the professional liability segment also includes accident and health  workers compensation and multi line insurance 
proassurance has curtailed its participation in these lines of business and expects substantial reductions in premiums written over the next twelve months 
earned premiums will taper off more slowly  reflecting the written premium volumes of earlier periods 
proassurance s personal lines insurance segment provides personal property and casualty insurance to individuals 
proassurance s personal lines segment includes the operations of a single insurance company  meemic insurance company 
professionals group activity has only been included in proassurance s consolidated results since the date of the consolidation on june  prior to the consolidation with professionals group  proassurance did not have a personal lines segment 
all revenues and expenses of proassurance are allocated to the operating segments  other than investment income earned directly by the proassurance holding and interest expense related to long term debt held by the parent 
interest expense for the year ended december  of million relates entirely to the credit agreement obtained in order to finance the consolidation with professionals group 
the debt bears interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor or the bank s base rate as elected from time to time by proassurance 
at december  the interest rate was 
see note to the proassurance s consolidated financial statements for more information regarding proassurance s credit agreement 
proassurance recognized a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  as compared to a tax expense of million for the year ended december  tax exempt investment income is the primary reason that proassurance s effective rates for both years are significantly lower than the expected statutory rate of 
proassurance derives a significant portion of its investment income from tax exempt sources 
income before taxes and minority interest includes tax exempt investment income of approximately million in and million in after adjustment for tax exempt income  proassurance experienced a taxable loss for the year ended december  as compared to taxable income for the year ended december  proassurance has available approximately million in federal tax loss carryforwards 
these carryforwards begin to expire in the year approximately million of the carryforwards relate to the consolidation with professionals group 
as such  the amount which can be utilized by proassurance in any one year is limited to approximately million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to management s estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
the following policies are those management believes to be the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
proassurance s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to proassurance s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
proassurance recognizes insurance premium income on a monthly pro rata basis over the respective terms of the policies in force 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies in force 
reinsurance arrangements are prospective contracts for which prepaid reinsurance premiums are amortized ratably over the related policy terms based on the estimated ultimate amounts to be paid 
changes in estimated outcomes are recognized currently 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense 
proassurance s reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense represents management s estimate of the future amounts necessary to pay claims and expenses associated with investigation and settlement of claims 
these estimates consist of case and reserves and bulk reserves 
case reserves are estimates of future losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and lae for reported claims and are established by proassurance s claims department 
bulk reserves  which include a provision for losses that have occurred but have not been reported to proassurance as well as development on reported claims  are the difference between i the sum of case reserves and paid losses and ii an actuarially determined estimate of the total losses and lae necessary for the ultimate settlement of all reported claims and incurred but not reported claims  including amounts already paid 
the estimates take into consideration proassurance s past loss experience  available industry data and projections as to future claims frequency  severity  inflationary trends and settlement patterns 
estimating reserves  especially professional liability reserves  is a complex process which is heavily dependent on judgment and involves many uncertainties 
as a result  reserve estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
the assumptions used in establishing proassurance s reserves are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in current operations 
investments 
at december  and  all of proassurance s securities are classified as available for sale and are those securities that would be available to be sold in response to its liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates and investment management strategies  among others 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of the related income tax effect  excluded from income and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
a decline in the fair value of an available for sale security below cost that proassurance s management judges not to be temporary is charged against income in the current period 
professional liability insurance segment operating results for proassurance s professional liability insurance segment for the twelve months ended december  and are summarized in the table below in thousands 
year ended december increase decrease gross premiums written    revenues premiums earned    premiums ceded    net premiums earned    net investment income    other income    total revenues    expenses net losses and loss adjustment expenses    underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses    total expenses    income before income taxes    premiums premiums written professional liability premiums written for the year ended december  increased by million as compared to the same period of the increase is primarily attributable to proassurance s consolidation with professionals group but also includes the effect of rate increases implemented during medical assurance and professionals group implemented rate increases averaging on renewals 
their retention of insureds averaged approximately during proassurance plans to continue to implement rate increases based on loss trends  subject to regulatory approval 
to date  premiums renewed at the higher rates coupled with new business have more than offset the effect of premiums lost due to decreased retention of insureds 
however  the higher rates may result in a greater loss of insureds in future periods 
premiums earned as with written premiums  the increase in earned premiums for the for the year ended december  as compared to is primarily attributable to the consolidation and to a lesser degree  higher rates 
rate increases implemented after january  have not yet been fully reflected in earned premiums since premiums are earned over the entire policy period usually one year after the policy is written 
reinsurance premiums ceded are estimated based on the terms of the respective reinsurance agreements 
the estimated expense is continually reviewed and any adjustments that become necessary are included in current operations 
several factors contributed to the increase in reinsurance premiums ceded for as compared to the increase in earned premiums as a result of the consolidation accounted for approximately of the increase 
during the fourth quarter of  proassurance decreased retention levels and  thus  in more earned premiums were subject to reinsurance 
also  in more premiums were earned in markets where proassurance relies more heavily on reinsurance 
included in net earned premiums for the years ended december   and are accident and health  workers compensation and multi line premiums of approximately million and million  respectively 
proassurance has historically written accident and health  workers compensation and multi line premiums from time to time as favorable opportunities arose to utilize capital 
proassurance began during to decrease its commitment to these programs 
however  premiums continued to be written and earned during and due to existing contractual relationships 
proassurance expects substantially decreased premiums from this source in the coming year 
the increase during reflects both volume increases and higher rates charged on this business 
the volume increases in relate to contractual agreements that have now either expired or been canceled 
losses proassurance s consolidation with professionals group on june  increased professional liability net loss reserves by approximately million bringing consolidated professional liability net loss reserves to approximately billion 
as discussed in note of proassurance s consolidated financial statements  the transaction was accounted for as a purchase transaction and professionals group reserves were valued at their estimated fair value on the date of consolidation 
professional liability losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and the related current accident year loss ratio are summarized in the following table dollars in thousands 
year ended december incurred loss related to current accident year   prior accident years   change in death  disability and retirement reserves   net incurred loss   current accident year net loss ratio losses incurred include three components a actuarial evaluation of incurred loss levels for the current accident year  b actuarial re evaluation of incurred loss levels for prior accident years and c actuarial re evaluation of the reserve for the death  disability and retirement provision 
these components take into consideration prior loss experience  loss trends  changes in the frequency and severity of claims  premium rate loads and the retention of insureds 
any adjustments related to previously established amounts are included in current operations 
claims are resolved over an extended number of years and a number of these claims are litigated 
management uses methods it believes to be reasonable and appropriate in establishing its loss reserves  but during the extended period in which claims are resolved  the legal environment and other factors may change 
consequently  ultimate losses are inherently difficult to estimate and actual results may vary from the estimated amounts 
given the large volume of loss reserves at any balance sheet date  a small change in the estimate of those reserves can have a significant effect on current operations 
proassurance s most recent actuarial evaluation indicated that due to increasing trends in severity and frequency of claims  the average ultimate payment of indemnity and loss adjustment expenses per exposure unit for recent accident years appears likely to exceed comparable averages for previous years 
consequently  during  proassurance recognized million of additional net losses related to prior accident years  representing approximately of december  professional liability net reserves of billion 
in  the million decrease in the reserve for death  disability and retirement is principally the result of an increase in premium rate loads and a decrease in the number of insureds primarily related to the pronational book of business 
the current accident year loss ratio in the table above is calculated by dividing current accident year incurred losses by net premiums earned 
the principal reason for the increase in that ratio in is the effect of the inclusion of professional group s premiums and losses 
investment income for purposes of this discussion  the investment portfolio is comprised of fixed maturities and equity securities at amortized cost and short term investments 
the earnings on the portfolio constitute the related net investment income 
net investment income increased by million as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the net increase in the investment portfolio as a result of the consolidation with professionals group 
at december   the investment portfolio of billion consisted of taxable securities and tax exempt securities 
at december   the average yield of the professional liability segment fixed maturity investments was 
the principal investment objective of proassurance is to achieve a high level of after tax income while minimizing risk 
although fixed maturity securities are purchased with the initial intent to hold such securities until their maturity  disposals of securities prior to their respective maturities may occur if management believes such disposals are consistent with proassurance s overall investment objectives  including maximizing after tax yields 
proassurance is restructuring its investment portfolio to include a higher proportion of taxable securities 
at december  approximately million of the professional liability portfolio is invested in principally taxable short term securities  a substantial portion of these short term securities will be converted to longer term fixed maturity and equity investments during other income the most significant component of other income is net realized capital gains 
net realized capital gains increased from million in to million in this increase primarily resulted from additional sales of investment securities related to proassurance s restructuring its investment portfolio  as discussed under investment income 
net realized capital gains included in other income by quarter during each year are as follows in thousands first second third fourth net capital gains in the fourth quarter of include a loss of  recognized on one investment that was deemed to have an other than temporary decline in market value 
all other declines in market values of proassurance s investment securities at december  were deemed to be temporary

the underwriting expense ratio underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses divided by net premiums earned also increased  for the ratio was as compared to for the same period in the increase in the ratio is primarily due to an increase in guaranty fund assessments 
the remaining increase is due to normal fluctuations in acquisition expenses between years 
guaranty fund assessments for the year ended december  were approximately million  an increase of million as compared to the year ended december  proassurance is required by most states to be a member of its insolvency or guaranty fund association and  as such  must make payments to the association when so assessed by the state 
such assessments can and do vary widely from year to year

after giving effect to insureds that did not renew  a net increase of approximately million resulted from rate increases and writing premiums at approved higher rates 
partially offsetting this million increase was a decrease of million resulting from one time additional premiums written in january related to the purchase of a book of business 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of  accident and health  workers compensation and multi line premiums increased by million  however  as previously discussed  similar growth is not expected in future periods 
premiums earned medical professional liability premiums earned decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to same period in as with written premiums  million of this decrease was due to one time additional premiums earned in related to the purchase of a book of business 
direct and assumed accident and health  workers compensation and multi line premiums earned increased by million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of premiums ceded decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily related to workers compensation  accident and health  and multi line premiums earned 
while the total earned amount of these premiums increased during  the proportion of the premiums that were ceded decreased 
as a result  ceded premiums were lower for the year ended december  net earned premiums included accident and health  workers compensation and multi line premiums of approximately million in and million in proassurance has previously disclosed its commitment to discontinue participation in the underwriting programs that generated most of these premiums and expects substantially decreased premiums in future periods 
losses consolidated losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and the related current year loss ratio are summarized in the following table dollars in thousands 
year ended december incurred loss related to current accident year   prior accident years   change in death  disability and retirement reserves  net incurred loss   current accident year net loss ratio losses incurred include three components a actuarial evaluation of incurred loss levels for the current accident year  b actuarial re evaluation of incurred loss levels for prior accident years and c actuarial re evaluation of the reserve for the death  disability and retirement provision 
these components take into consideration prior loss experience  loss trends  changes in the frequency and severity of claims  premium rate loads and the retention of insureds 
any adjustments related to previously established amounts are included in current operations 
the current accident year loss ratio current accident year net loss divided by net premiums earned increased to from 
this change is due to increasing trends in severity and frequency of professional liability claims recognized by proassurance during the year as a result of these same trends  the average ultimate payment of indemnity and loss adjustment expenses per exposure unit for recent accident years appears likely to exceed comparable averages for previous years 
although such per claim average remains within the level contemplated by the previously established reserves  the effect was favorable loss development during the year ended december  of million versus million during the year ended december  in  the million decrease in the reserve for death  disability and retirement is principally the result of an increase in premium rate loads and a decrease in the number of insureds 
investment income for purposes of this discussion  invested assets are comprised of fixed maturities and equity securities at amortized cost and short term investments 
the earnings on such invested assets constitute the related net investment income 
consolidated net investment income was million in compared to million in the million increase is attributable to both to increased average yields and to growth in the amount of invested assets 
at december   the investment portfolio consisted of taxable securities and tax exempt securities 
at december   the average yield of fixed maturity investments was 
other income other income decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is principally attributable to a million decrease in capital gains realized upon the sale of securities during as compared to underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily because of a million decrease in guaranty fund assessments 
the underwriting expense ratio underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses divided by premiums earned for was as compared to for the same period in the decrease in the ratio was due both to the reduction in guaranty fund assessments and to the cost control measures implemented by proassurance during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk proassurance initially invests only in investment grade securities with the intent at the time of purchase that such securities will be held until maturity 
proassurance is exposed to various market risks  including both interest rate risk and equity price risk 
interest rate risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument caused by fluctuations in market interest rates 
proassurance handles market risks in accordance with its established investment policies 
the goal of these policies is to implement a strategic asset allocation that maximizes the long term rate of return at a minimum level of risk given a set of asset classes and restrictions 
market risk control relates principally to ratings of issuers and length to maturity 
proassurance does not enter into derivative transactions 
at december  fixed maturity securities totaling  million  at fair value  comprised of proassurance s invested assets of  million 
thus  the most significant market risk to proassurance is interest rate risk related to the fixed maturity portfolio 
proassurance believes it is in a position to keep these investments until final maturity and does not invest in fixed maturity securities for trading purposes 
nevertheless  fluctuations in market interest rates may significantly impact the fair value of this portfolio 
proassurance estimates that the fair value of its fixed maturity portfolio and the weighted average modified duration would respond to fluctuations in market interest rates as follows portfolio change in modified interest value value duration rates millions millions years current rate  current rates are as of december  at december  the fair value of proassurance s investment in common stocks  excluding preferred stocks as discussed in the following paragraph  was million  which included net unrealized losses of million 
these securities are subject to price risk 
a hypothetical increase in the market prices as of december  would increase the fair value of these securities to million  a hypothetical decrease would reduce the fair value to million 
the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst scenarios 
at december  fair value of proassurance s investment in preferred stocks was million  including net unrealized gains of million 
these securities carry fixed rates of return and thus  like fixed maturities  are primarily subject to interest rate risk 
the fixed maturities table above does not include preferred stocks 
proassurance s cash and short term investment portfolio at december  was on a cost basis which approximates its fair value 
this portfolio lacks significant market rate sensitivity due to its short duration
