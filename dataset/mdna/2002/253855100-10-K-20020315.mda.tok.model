item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on current expectations  forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially 
these risks and uncertainties include fluctuations in operating results  changes in the united states and worldwide economy and fluctuations in capital expenditures within the telecommunications industry  our dependence on a limited number of products and uncertainties of the market for our current and planned products  technological change  our dependence on growth of the internet  competition  our dependence on a limited number of major customers  our dependence on contract manufacturers and suppliers  our products may not continue to meet changing regulatory and industry standards  our ability to achieve sustained operating profitability  our dependence on key personnel  the significant influence of our principal stockholder  our dependence on proprietary technology  the volatility of our market price  the sale of a significant number of our shares pursuant to future sales contracts could depress the price of our stock  the effect that anti takeover provisions have on the price of our common stock and past and future litigation risks 
for a further list and description of such risks and uncertainties  see the reports filed by digital lightwave with the securities and exchange commission  including the company s reports on form k and q 
digital lightwave undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview digital lightwave  inc provides the global fiber optic communications industry with products and technology used to develop  install  maintain  monitor and manage fiber optic based networks 
telecommunications service providers and equipment manufacturers deploy the company s products to provide quality assurance and ensure optimum performance of advanced optical communications networks and network equipment 
the company s products are sold worldwide to leading and emerging telecommunications service providers  telecommunications equipment manufacturers  equipment leasing companies and international distributors 
fiber optics deliver increased network bandwidth for the transmission of voice  video  audio  and data traffic over public and private networks  including the internet 
the company s products provide the capabilities to cost effectively deploy and manage fiber optic networks to address increasing demand for bandwidth 
while the technology of optical networking is highly advanced  the company s products are used to verify that telecommunications products and systems function and perform properly 
specific customer applications of the company s diagnostic equipment include the qualification of products during manufacturing  the verification of service during network installation and the monitoring and maintenance of deployed networks 
the company s two product lines are network information computers and network access agents 
network information computers are portable instruments for the installation and maintenance testing of advanced  high speed networks and transmission equipment 
the nic product family provides diagnostic capabilities for testing the performance of both optical and legacy electrical networks with an array of communications standards and transmission rates 
naas are unattended  software controlled  performance monitoring and diagnostic systems permanently installed within optical based networks 
naas embed the capabilities of our portable network information computers within a customer s network infrastructure  allowing centralized remote network management 
the company s net sales are generated from sales of its products less an estimate for customer returns 
we expect that the average selling price asp of its nic and its naa will fluctuate based on a variety of factors  including product configuration  potential volume discounts to customers  the timing of new product introductions and enhancements and the introduction of competitive products 
because the cost of goods sold tends to remain relatively stable for any given product  fluctuations in the asp may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company primarily sells its products through a direct sales force to telecommunications service providers and network equipment manufacturers 
the company sells to international markets through international distributor channels with some direct sales and sales support 
sales of our products have tended to be concentrated with a few major customers and we expect sales will continue to be concentrated with a few major customers in the future 
for the year ended december   our largest customer  level communications  accounted for approximately of total sales 
for the years ended december  and  our largest customer  telogy  accounted for approximately and of total sales  respectively 
for the year ended december   one additional customer  technology rental services  accounted for of total sales 
no other customer accounted for sales of or more during those years 
the company has not entered into long term agreements or blanket purchase orders for the sale of its products 
it generally obtains purchase orders for immediate shipment and other cancelable purchase commitments 
the company does not expect to carry substantial backlog from quarter to quarter in the future 
our sales during a particular quarter are highly dependent upon orders placed by customers during the quarter 
most of our operating expenses are fixed and cannot be easily reduced in response to decreased revenues 
variations in the timing of revenues could cause significant variations in results of operations from quarter to quarter and result in continuing quarterly losses 
the deferral of any large order from one quarter to another would negatively affect the results of operations for the earlier quarter 
the company must obtain orders during each quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve revenue and profit objectives 
reduced customer capital expenditures and the overall economic weakness caused the company to incur net operating losses in the third and fourth quarters of in october and january  the company took certain measures to reduce its future operating costs 
these measures included a reduction in force  pay cuts for management and other expense reduction actions 
the company can give no assurance as to whether its revenues will return to previous levels or when it will return to profitability 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following accounting policies are critical in that they are important to portrayal of the company s financial conditions and results and they require difficult  subject and complex judgments that are often the results of estimates that are inherently uncertain revenue recognition and estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically sales returns and other allowances  the reserve for uncollectible accounts  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from product sales 
we make certain judgments and estimates used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
it is likely that material differences would result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when we believe the following factors have been achieved persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we use a binding purchase order as evidence that an arrangement for all sales exist 
sales through our international distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship with the distributor 
we either obtain an end user purchase order documenting that an order has been placed with the distributor or proof of delivery to the end user as evidence that an arrangement for sale exists 
for demonstration units sold to distributors  we use the distributor s binding purchase order as evidence of a sales arrangement 
for domestic sales  delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
demonstration units sold to our international distributors are considered delivered when the units are delivered to a common carrier 
in the case of shipments to an international distributor that will be resold  delivery occurs when we receive either a copy of the end user binding purchase order or proof of delivery to the end user 
we provide an allowance for sales returns based on historical experience 
we assess whether the price associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured at the time of the transaction 
our assessment that the price is fixed and determinable is based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
our standard payment terms for domestic customers are days from the invoice date 
distributor contracts provide standard payment terms of days from the invoice date 
we have not offered extended payment terms 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of an accounts receivable is not reasonably assured  we will defer the amount and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
sales returns and other allowances  reserve for uncollectible accounts  reserve for excess and obsolete inventory and litigation the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
we estimate the amount of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we consider many factors when making our estimates  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products to evaluate the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
our estimate of the provision for sales returns and other allowances as of december  was million 
we also estimate the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we consider many factors when making our estimates  including analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for uncollectible accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was as of december   million  net of our estimated reserve for uncollectible accounts of million 
we estimate the amount of excess and obsolete inventory 
we consider many factors when making our estimates  including analyzing current and expected sales trends  the amount of current parts on hand  the current market value of parts on hand and the viability and technical obsolescence of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
our inventory balance as of december   was million net of our estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
we estimate the amount of liability the company may incur as a result of pending litigation 
our estimate of legal liability is uncertain and is based on the size of the outstanding claims and an assessment of the merits of the claims 
we accrued million for liability resulting from pending litigation as of december  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates as additional information becomes available 
we make significant judgments and estimates and assumptions in connection with establishing the amount of sales returns and other allowances  the uncollectability of our account receivables  the amount of excess and obsolete inventory and the amount of liability related to pending litigation during any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or used different estimates or assumptions for establishing such amounts  it is likely that our financial results for any period would be materially different

trend and uncertainties prior to  we had experienced sequential growth over a five year period 
this growth was attributable primarily to the rapid expansion and substantial installation of fiber optic networks fueled by an unprecedented demand for bandwidth to accommodate exponentially increasing internet traffic 
we participated in that growth as a leading supplier of products that are used in the installation  maintenance and management of fiber optic communication networks 
during  our industry experienced a dramatic economic downturn that was brought on by a significant decrease in network build outs and capital spending by the telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers 
our customers declining business resulted in a major decrease in sales of our products 
we do not anticipate a near term recovery of the fiber optic test equipment market and do not expect the overall capital spending by telecommunication carriers and equipment factors will increase during in january  we announced a program for rescaling our business in response to the current market environment 
specific actions taken as part of our plan include reducing cost 
we have taken immediate steps during the last two quarters of and in january of to reduce costs 
these initiatives included a reduction in workforce and expenses that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately million on an annualized basis beginning in the second quarter of with the successful migration of our current product lines to next generation platforms  we began outsourcing manufacturing activities with jabil circuit  inc in january of we expect this to allow us to further reduce operating expenses associated with manufacturing overhead and lower the carrying risks of inventory during economically driven shifts in customer demand 
growing market share 
we are focused on maintaining market leadership with our product lines 
we have evaluated our sales efforts to identify opportunities where our account presence can be improved and are working to exploit those opportunities 
we expect new applications for our installed product base to be realized with use of new modular add ons and enhancements 
we are expanding our distribution channels to specific global markets 
accelerating product development 
we are escalating our efforts to bring products currently under development to market faster 
we are concentrating on the products and technologies that we believe are most important to our customers 
we plan to introduce enhancements to our product lines to meet growing international needs and global high speed data service requirements 
expanding into additional telecommunications markets 
we are identifying and pursuing specific telecommunication market segments  both domestically and internationally  that we believe will be synergistic with our current business and create opportunities for growth 
we believe that the initiatives outlined will allow us to meet our current customer needs  develop new opportunities and position the company for a market recovery 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are not exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because all of our services are invoiced in us dollars 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on our short term cash investments  consisting of us treasury obligations and other investments in respect of institutions with the highest credit ratings  all of which have maturities of three months or less 
these short term investments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
we believe that the impact of a increase or decline in interest rates would not be material to our investment income
