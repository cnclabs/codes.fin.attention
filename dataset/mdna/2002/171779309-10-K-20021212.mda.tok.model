item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview ciena  a leader in intelligent optical networking systems and software  offers telecommunications network solutions to service providers and enterprises worldwide 
our customers include long distance carriers  local exchange carriers  internet service providers  wireless and wholesale carriers  systems integrators  governments  large businesses and non profit institutions 
ciena offers network solutions that enable service providers to provision  manage and deliver economic  high bandwidth services to their customers 
in early  the telecommunications industry began a severe decline  which has affected almost all of its segments  including equipment suppliers like ciena 
that decline  which has continued in  has caused the market for our equipment to shrink substantially  with a resulting adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 
for the last several years  the market for our equipment was influenced by the entry of a substantial number of new companies into the communications services business 
in the united states  this was largely due to changes in the regulatory environment  in particular those brought about by the telecommunications act of these new companies raised billions of dollars in capital  much of which they invested in capital improvements  causing an acceleration in the growth of the market for telecommunications equipment 
the last two years have seen a reversal of this trend  including the failure of a large number of the new entrants and a sharp contraction of the availability of capital to the industry 
more recently  several of the more established carriers have experienced significant financial distress 
these developments have caused a substantial reduction in demand for telecommunications equipment  including our products 
this industry trend has been compounded by the slowing not only of the united states economy  but the economies in virtually all of the countries we market our products 
the combination of these factors has caused our customers to become more conservative in their capital investment plans and more uncertain about their future purchases 
as a consequence  we are facing a market that is both reduced in size and more difficult to predict and plan for 
these trends have had a number of significant effects on our business during fiscal  including the reduction of revenues by  million compared to fiscal  the incurrence of million of costs related to obsolete inventory and excess purchase commitments  restructuring charges of million  goodwill impairment charges of million  provisions for bad debt expense of million  million in losses on equity investments and a net income tax charge of approximately million to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our net loss of  million during fiscal was primarily attributable to these factors 
on june   we acquired by merger oni systems corp 
oni  a nasdaq listed corporation headquartered in san jose  california 
in anticipation of and following the merger  the two companies took steps to eliminate functional redundancies and achieve operational cost synergies anticipated as a result of their combination 
during the quarter ended july   ciena and oni reduced their combined workforce by approximately employees 
approximately million of costs associated with the oni workforce reduction qualify for treatment under eitf recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase combination and were recorded as an element of the acquisition 
as of october   ciena and its subsidiaries employed approximately  persons  which was a net reduction of  persons from the approximate  employed on october  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires ciena to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  ciena re evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
ciena bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
ciena believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition ciena recognizes product revenue in accordance with the shipping terms specified and where collection is reasonably assured 
for transactions where ciena has yet to obtain customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the terms of acceptance are satisfied 
revenue for installation services is recognized as the services are performed unless the terms of the supply contract combine product acceptance with installation  in which case revenues for installation services are recognized when the terms of acceptance are satisfied and installation is completed 
revenues from installation service fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs for each contract 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
for transactions involving the sale of software  revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition  including deferral of revenue recognition in instances where vendor specific objective evidence for undelivered elements is not determinable 
for distributor sales where risks of ownership have not transferred  ciena recognizes revenue when the product is shipped through to the end user 
allowances for doubtful accounts ciena maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of ciena s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of october   our accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million  was million  which included three customers who accounted for   and of the net trade accounts receivable  respectively 
warranties ciena provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
ciena engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers and third party contractors 
ciena s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from ciena s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
reserve for inventory for obsolescence ciena writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
as a result of the further decline in capital spending by our customers and a further decline in forecasted revenues of existing products  we recorded provisions for inventory  including purchase commitments  of million during fiscal if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
restructuring as part of its restructuring costs  ciena provides for the estimated cost of the net lease expense for facilities that are no longer being utilized 
the cost is based on the future minimum lease payments under contractual obligations offset by estimated future sublease payments 
as of the end of fiscal  ciena s accrued restructuring liability related to net lease expense and other related charges was million 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional restructuring costs associated with these facilities may be required 
minority investments ciena holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus 
as of october   million of these investments are included in other long term assets 
ciena records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million from a decline in the fair value of our equity investments that was determined to be other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
impairment of goodwill ciena adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
effective november  and upon adoption ceased to amortize goodwill 
as of october   ciena s assets include million related to goodwill 
sfas no 
requires goodwill amortization to cease and for goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of ciena below its earnings amount 
ciena performed the required annual impairment assessment of goodwill balances in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
during the fourth quarter fiscal which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of ciena below its earnings amount  additional goodwill impairment charges may be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance as of october   ciena has recorded a valuation allowance of million against our gross deferred tax assets of million 
the valuation allowance is calculated in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
positive evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight when  due to our current lack of visibility  there is a greater degree of uncertainty that the level of future profitability needed to record the deferred assets will be achieved 
our results over the most recent three year period were heavily affected by our recent deliberate and planned business restructuring activities 
the company s cumulative loss in the most recent three year period represents sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
results of operations fiscal years ended  and revenue 
we recognized   and million in revenue for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue of  million  or from fiscal to was due primarily to the reduction in demand for optical networking products worldwide 
this decrease in revenue occurred even though we had sales to customers in fiscal as compared to customers in fiscal the increase in revenue of approximately million  or from fiscal to was due primarily to an increase in shipments across all product lines 
ciena s geographic distribution of revenues is as follows in thousands fiscal years domestic international total during fiscal and  we derived the majority of our revenue from sales of long distance optical transport equipment using dwdm 
in  we began selling our coredirector intelligent optical core switch 
during fiscal  our revenues from that product exceeded our revenues from long distance transport equipment 
today we believe we hold an industry leading market share in the important emerging core switching product category 
during fiscal  we also recognized revenue from our metropolitan optical transport products including multiwave metro and the online products that we acquired through our merger with oni and from our multi service metropolitan access and switching platform  metrodirector k ciena s revenues derived from products and services is as follows in thousands fiscal years products services total historically  we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue

during fiscal  sprint and qwest communications each accounted for at least of our revenue and  combined  accounted for 
during fiscal  sprint  qwest communications and gts network ltd 
each accounted for at least of our revenue and  combined  accounted for 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be generated by a limited number of customers 
the loss of any one of these customers or any substantial reduction in orders by any one of these customers could materially adversely affect ciena s financial condition or operating results 
during the following fiscal years  customers who each accounted for at least of our revenues during the respective periods are as follows in thousands fiscal years sprint qwest   n a gts network  n a n a at t n a n a  total denotes of total revenue n a denotes revenues recognized less than for the period

gross margin was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin from fiscal compared to fiscal was largely attributable to increases in inventory obsolescence costs  lower manufacturing volumes resulting in reduced manufacturing efficiencies and changes in product mix resulting in sales of higher proportion of revenue from lower margin installation and tech support services 
the decrease in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in inventory obsolescence costs and price reductions resulting from competitive pressures  which were partially offset by increased sales of higher margin products such as coredirector systems and on center network element and service management software

the amount of purchase price allocated to in process research and development was determined using the discounted cash flow method 
this method consisted of estimating future net cash flows attributable to the in process k technology for a discrete projection period and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
restructuring costs 
during fiscal  we incurred million in restructuring charges associated with our ongoing efforts to align our operations with the current telecommunications industry environment 
the restructuring charge included million associated with work force reductions of approximately  employees  million primarily related to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs and an million write down related to property and equipment consisting primarily of leasehold improvements  production equipment and research test equipment

the charge included million primarily related to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs and also included an million write down related to property and equipment consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and production equipment 
it is possible that we may incur similar charges in the future as a result of our efforts to bring costs in line with revenue expectations 
goodwill impairment 
on adoption of sfas no 
 we determined that ciena s operations represent a single reporting unit 
we completed an impairment review of the goodwill associated with our reporting unit during the three months ended january  we compared the fair value of ciena s reporting unit at november  to the carrying value  including goodwill  for the unit at november   and determined that the carrying value  including goodwill  did not exceed the unit s fair value 
as a result no impairment charge was required on adoption 
in accordance with sfas  which requires annual testing to determine and measure goodwill impairment on a reporting unit basis  and with the assistance from independent valuation experts  we performed an assessment of the fair value of ciena s single reporting unit and its intangible assets as of september  we compared ciena s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill and determined that ciena s carrying value  including goodwill  exceeded fair value 
as a result  we then assessed the fair value of ciena s assets  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities and derived an implied fair value for ciena s goodwill 
since the carrying amount of goodwill was greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss of million was recognized 
we determined the fair value of ciena using the average market price of ciena s common stock over a day period before and after september  and a control premium of 
we determined the estimated fair value of identified intangible assets and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities using discounted cash flows 
the cash flow periods used were eight years  applying annual growth rates of to 
ciena used discount rates of to based of the specific risks and circumstances associated with the identified intangible asset or other non goodwill assets or liability being evaluated 
the assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows for identified intangible assets and other non goodwill assets and liabilities  including the discount rate  reflects management s estimates 
the discount rate was based upon ciena s weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the risks associated with its operations 
as part of our review of financial results for fiscal  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our long lived assets including significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of cyras 
we performed the assessment pursuant to statement financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas because of the significant negative industry and economic trends affecting both ciena s current operations and expected future sales of metrodirector k as well as the general decline of technology valuations 
the conclusion of that assessment was that the decline in market conditions within ciena s industry was significant and other than temporary 
as a result  we recorded a charge of billion to reduce goodwill during the fourth quarter of based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value 
the write down was related to the goodwill associated with the cyras transaction 
fair value was determined based on discounted future cash flows for the operating entity  which had separately identifiable cash flows 
the cash flow periods used were six years  applying annual growth rates ranging from to 
the discount rate used was  and the terminal values were estimated based upon a terminal growth rate of 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows  including the discount rate and estimated terminal values  reflect management s best estimates 
the discount rate was based upon ciena s weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the risks associated with its operations 
pirelli litigation

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report  including the reports we incorporate by reference  you should consider the following factors before investing in our securities 
our business could continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable and uncertain conditions in the communications industry and the economy in general over the last two years  there has been a sharp contraction of the availability of capital to finance communications networks  and many of our customers and potential customers have experienced significant financial distress 
this industry trend has been compounded by the slowing not only of the united states economy but the economies in virtually all of the countries in which we are marketing our products 
these developments have caused a substantial reduction in demand for our products which has adversely affected our revenues and operating results 
in addition  most of our customers have become more conservative and uncertain about their future purchases which has made managing our business difficult 
we expect the factors described above to continue to affect our business for an indeterminate period  in several significant ways our markets will be characterized by reduced capital expenditures by our customers  we will continue to have only limited ability to forecast the volume and product mix of our sales  managing our expenditures will be difficult in light of the uncertainties surrounding our business  increased competition resulting from reduced demand will put substantial downward pressures on the pricing of our products  tending to reduce our profit margins  increased competition will enable customers to insist on more favorable terms and conditions for sales  including extended payment terms or other financing assistance  as a condition of procuring their business  and the bankruptcies or weakened financial condition of some of our customers may require us to write off amounts due us from prior sales 
the result of any one or a combination of these factors could lead to further reduced revenues and increased operating losses 
we face intense competition that could hurt our sales and profitability the market for optical networking equipment is extremely competitive 
competition in the optical networking market is based on varying combinations of price  functionality  software functionality  manufacturing capability  installation  services  scalability and the ability of the system solution to meet customers immediate and future network requirements 
a small number of very large companies  including alcatel  cisco  fujitsu  hitachi  lucent  nec  nortel  siemens and ericsson  have historically dominated the telecommunications equipment industry 
they all have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing and intellectual property resources than ciena 
they also often have existing relationships with our potential customers 
because we sell systems that compete directly with product offerings of these companies  and in some cases displace or replace their equipment  we represent a competitive threat 
the recent decline in the market for optical networking equipment has resulted in even greater competitive pressures 
we expect that the aggressive tactics we have confronted on the part of many of these competitors will continue  and perhaps become more severe 
these tactics include price discounting  particularly when a competitor is selling used equipment or inventory that a competitor has written down or written off  early announcements of competing products and other marketing efforts  one stop shopping options  customer financing assistance  marketing and advertising assistance  and intellectual property disputes 
in addition  several of our largest competitors are experiencing financial difficulties 
in competition with these vendors for the business of customers to which the competitor has been historically a major supplier  we have confronted situations in which the competitor contends that unless the customer awards it the business  the competitor may fail  leaving the customer without support for the competitor s equipment already in the network 
to the extent that such arguments are successful  we may be at a disadvantage in winning new business 
tactics such as those described above can be particularly effective in a highly concentrated customer base like ours 
our customers are under increasing competitive pressure to deliver their services at the lowest possible cost 
this pressure may result in the pricing of optical networking systems becoming a more important factor in customer decisions 
this may favor larger competitors that can spread the effect of price discounts in their optical networking products across a larger array of products and services and across a larger customer base than ours 
if we are unable to offset any reductions in the average sales price for our products by a reduction in the cost of our products  our gross profit margins will be adversely affected 
our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross profit margins would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our customers have indicated that they intend to establish a relationship with at least two vendors for optical networking products 
with respect to customers for whom we are the only supplier of intelligent optical products  we do not know when or if these customers will select a second vendor or what impact the selection might have on purchases from us 
if a second optical networking supplier is chosen  these customers could reduce their purchases from us  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us 
new competitors continue to emerge to compete with our products 
they often base their products on the latest available technology 
they may achieve commercial availability of their products more quickly due to the narrower focus of their efforts 
our inability to compete successfully against these companies would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic conditions may require us to reduce the size of our business further in november  february  march  june in connection with the oni merger and again in september  we undertook significant reductions in force  some of which were accompanied by dispositions of assets  as part of our effort to reduce the size of our operations to better match the reduced sales of our products and services 
weakness in the global economy generally and the telecommunications equipment market in particular continue to affect our business substantially 
we may be required to undertake further reductions in force 
any such steps would likely result in significant charges from write downs or write offs of assets  costs of lease terminations  and expenses resulting from the termination of personnel 
product performance problems could limit our sales prospects the development and production of new products with high technology content  including optical networking products  often involves problems with software  components and manufacturing methods 
if significant reliability  quality or network monitoring problems develop  including those due to defects in software or faulty components  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including costs associated with fixing software defects or reworking our manufacturing processes  high service and warranty expenses  payment of liquidated damages for performance failures  high inventory obsolescence expense  high levels of product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 
although we maintain accruals for product warranties  actual costs could exceed these amounts 
from time to time  there will be interruptions or delays in the activation of our products at a customer s site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from aspects of the installation and activation activities  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that we can not promptly resolve  confidence in our products could be undermined  which could cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business 
our results can fluctuate unpredictably in general  our revenues and operating results in any reporting period may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including fluctuations in demand for our products  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  the timing and size of orders from customers  changes in customers requirements  including changes or cancellations to orders from customers  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changes in the price or availability of components for our products  readiness of customer sites for installation  satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria and related revenue recognition issues  manufacturing and shipment delays and deferrals  increased service  installation  warranty or repair costs  the timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on employee gains on stock options exercised  and changes in general economic conditions as well as those specific to the telecommunications and intelligent optical networking industries 
our intelligent optical networking products require large investments 
we have a limited number of potential customers in each geographic market  and each has unique needs 
our customers are generally technically sophisticated and demanding 
as a result  the sales cycles for our products are long  often as much as a year or two between initial contact with a potential customer and the recognition of revenue from sales to the customer 
our customers purchases tend to be large and sporadic  depending upon their need to build a customer base  their plans for expanding their networks  the availability of financing  and the effects of regulatory and business conditions in the countries in which they operate 
as a result  their purchase decisions can be unpredictable and subject to unanticipated changes 
our results  in turn  tend to fluctuate unpredictably 
this tendency has been amplified by conditions arising from the current uncertain economic environment 
current economic and market conditions have made it more difficult to make reliable estimates of future revenues 
fluctuations in our revenue can lead to even greater fluctuations in our operating profits 
our budgeted expense levels depend in part on our expectations of long term future revenue 
these budgets reflect the substantial investments in financial  engineering  manufacturing and logistics support resources we must make to support large customers  even though we are unsure of the volume  duration or timing of their purchases 
in addition  we continue to make substantial expenditures on the development of new and enhanced products 
any substantial adjustment to expenses to account for lower levels of revenue is difficult and takes time 
consequently  if our revenue does decline  our levels of inventory  operating expenses and general overhead would be high relative to our revenue  reducing our profitability  and perhaps resulting in additional operating losses 
our future success will depend on our ability to acquire new customers and expand our product portfolio historically  a large percentage of our sales have been made to emerging carriers  many of which have recently experienced severe financial difficulties 
consequently  we expect our sales to emerging carriers to be reduced  and our future success will depend on our ability to increase our sales to incumbent carriers  including  in the united states  the regional bell operating companies rbocs  and abroad  the large  traditional telecommunications operators tos  many of which were formerly government owned post  telephone and telegraph enterprises 
these large companies typically require lengthy sales cycles 
many have long standing supplier relationships with other vendors  and our experience in selling to them is limited 
these customers often require extensive testing of products before accepting them  and we are typically unable to recognize revenue until the tests are completed satisfactorily 
the certification process for new telecommunications equipment used in the networks of the rbocs and tos tends to be particularly lengthy and difficult 
complying with these certification requirements may involve unanticipated delays that could adversely affect the timing of our ability to sell our products to these larger carriers 
if we do not succeed in penetrating this segment of the market  our business could suffer 
we sell some of our products to systems integrators and  to a limited extent  directly to large enterprises 
we have limited experience with sales through business partners  and it is uncertain to what extent we will be successful in pursuing them 
in order to make our offerings more attractive both to our existing customers and the new customers we hope to attract  we believe it is important that we expand our portfolio to include more products that operate at the edge of the network and add products that enable sophisticated services beyond transport and switching 
we plan to implement this strategy through a combination of internal development  acquisition of smaller companies  and forming strategic alliances with other vendors 
if we fail to execute this strategy  our addressable market may not be large enough to enable us to reach profitability at our current size 
the success of our strategy depends on our ability to increase our revenue substantially we believe that  as a matter of strategy  we must maintain a size and breadth of product portfolio that enables us to be successful in selling to the largest communications providers 
in order to carry out that strategy  we have deliberately chosen to continue to spend on research and development  sales  and other operating expenses at levels that will not permit us to return to profitability unless we can increase our revenues substantially 
if we fail to do so  we will be required to modify our strategy  which would likely have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we may not be successful in enhancing and upgrading our products the market for optical networking products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  and recurring changes in customer requirements 
to succeed in this market  we must continue to develop new products and new features for existing products 
doing so is difficult and costly and there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful 
in addition  we must be able to identify and gain access to promising new technologies 
failure to keep pace with technological advances would impair the competitiveness of our products and sooner or later do serious harm to our business 
our products are based on complex technology that could result in unanticipated delays in developing  improving  manufacturing or deploying them 
modifying our products to enable customers to integrate them into a new type of network architecture entails similar development risks 
certain enhancements to our products are in the development phase and are not yet ready for commercial manufacturing or deployment 
for example  we expect to offer additional feature enhancement releases of the coredirector product line over the life of the product and we expect to continue to enhance features of our corestream  online  and metrodirector k products over the life of these products 
the maturing process from laboratory prototype to customer trials  and subsequently to general availability  involves a number of steps  including completion of product development  the qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components  including asics  validation of manufacturing methods and processes  extensive quality assurance and reliability testing  and staffing of testing infrastructure  validation of software  and establishment of systems integration and systems test validation requirements 
each of these steps in turn presents serious risks of failure  rework or delay  any one of which could decrease the speed and scope of product introduction and marketplace acceptance of the product 
specialized asics and intensive software testing and validation are key to the timely introduction of enhancements to the coredirector  online  and metrodirector k product lines  and schedule delays are common in the final validation phase  as well as in the manufacture of specialized asics 
in addition  unexpected intellectual property disputes  failure of critical design elements  and a host of other execution risks may delay or even prevent the introduction of these products 
if we do not develop and successfully introduce these products in a timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers industry and economic conditions have weakened the financial position of some of our customers 
to sell to some of these customers we may be required to take risks of uncollectible accounts 
while we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves  it is possible that we may have to write down or write off doubtful accounts 
such write downs or write offs  if large  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our strategy involves pursuing strategic acquisitions and investments that may not be successful our business strategy includes acquiring or making strategic investments in other companies with a view to expanding our portfolio of products and services  acquiring new technologies  and accelerating the development of new or improved products 
to do so  we may issue equity that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership or incur debt or assume indebtedness 
in addition  we may incur significant amortization expenses related to intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter fiscal and fourth quarter fiscal  we incurred a significant write off of goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions 
acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from our core business  potential difficulties in completing projects of the acquired company  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and dependence on unfamiliar or relatively small supply partners 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic investments may involve risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions and of obtaining insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions 
we face risks in reselling the products of other companies we have recently entered into agreements that permit us to distribute the products of quipe and wavesmith 
to the extent we succeed in reselling their products  or products of other vendors with which we may enter into similar arrangements  we may be required by customers to assume warranty and service obligations 
while these suppliers have agreed to support us with respect to those obligations  they are relatively small companies with limited financial resources 
if they should be unable  for any reason  to provide the required support  we may have to expend our own resources on doing so 
this risk is amplified by the fact that the equipment has been designed and manufactured by others  and is thus subject to warranty claims whose magnitude we are currently unable to fully evaluate 
we may not be successful in selling our products through new channels our direct sales force is not designed or equipped to enable us to sell into the enterprise or government markets  or certain geographic markets 
we are accordingly taking steps to develop new sales channels through distributors and systems integrators for sales of those of our products  particularly the online edge  that are suitable for those markets 
we have limited experience in developing and managing such channels  and it is possible that our efforts may not succeed according to plan  which could reduce our revenues and profitability 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers  and for some items we do not have a substitute supplier we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components of our products  as well as for equipment used to manufacture and test our products 
our products include several high performance components for which reliable  high volume suppliers are particularly limited 
furthermore  some key optical and electronic components we use in our optical transport systems are currently available only from sole or limited sources  and in some cases  that source also is a competitor 
any delay in component availability for any of our products could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenues 
these delays could also harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
furthermore  one of our suppliers has recently announced its intention to exit the market for optical components 
this  or similar decisions by other suppliers  could result in reduced competition and higher prices for components we purchase 
in addition  the loss of a source of supply of key components could require us to re engineer products that use those components  which would increase our costs 
on occasion  we have experienced delays in receipt of components and have received components that do not perform according to their specifications 
any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments  which  in turn  could harm our business 
a consolidation among suppliers of these components or adverse developments in their businesses affecting their ability to supply us  could adversely impact the availability of components on which we depend 
delayed deliveries of key components from these sources could adversely affect our business 
any delays in component availability for any of our products or test equipment could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenue from them 
these delays could also harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
we rely on contract manufacturers for our products we rely on a small number of contract manufacturers to perform the majority of the manufacturing operations for our products 
the qualification of these manufacturers is an expensive and time consuming process  and these contract manufacturers build modules for other companies  including our competitors 
in addition  we do not have contracts in place with some of these manufacturers 
we may not be able to effectively manage our relationships with our manufacturers and we cannot be certain that they will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner 
if we underestimate our future product requirements  the contract manufacturers may not have enough product to meet our customer requirements  and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue 
if we cannot effectively manage these manufacturers and forecast future demand  or if they fail to deliver products or components on time  our business may suffer 
some of our suppliers are also competitors some of our component suppliers are both primary sources for components and major competitors in the market for system equipment 
we buy components from alcatel  nec  nortel  and siemens 
each of these companies offers optical communications systems and equipment that compete against our products 
a decline in reliability or other adverse change in these supply relationships could harm our business 
our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or if we infringe on intellectual property rights of others we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we enter into non disclosure and proprietary rights agreements with our employees and consultants  and license agreements with our corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our products  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
we have filed an intellectual property lawsuit to enforce our intellectual property right  and may become involved with additional disputes in the future 
such lawsuits can be costly and may significantly divert the time and attention of our personnel 
we have received  and may receive in the future  notices from holders of patents in the optical technology field that raise issues of possible infringement by our products 
questions of infringement in the optical networking equipment market often involve highly technical and subjective analysis 
we cannot assure you that any of these patent holders or others will not in the future initiate legal proceedings against us  or that we will be successful in defending against these actions 
we are involved in intellectual property disputes regarding the possible infringement of our products 
in the past  we have been forced to take a license from the owner of allegedly infringed intellectual property  or to redesign or stop selling the product that includes the challenged intellectual property 
if we are sued for infringement and are unsuccessful in defending the suit  we could be subject to significant damages  and our business and customer relationships could be adversely affected 
we are a defendant in a lawsuit originally brought by nortel networks against oni accusing oni of patent infringement and theft of trade secrets 
nortel has also recently filed a separate action against us alleging that ciena is infringing several nortel patents 
if nortel were to win either of these lawsuits  there is a possibility that we could be required to pay nortel substantial damages  to negotiate a license agreement that would require us to pay substantial royalties  or both 
we face risks associated with our international operations we market  sell and service our products globally 
we have established offices around the world  including in north america  europe  latin america and in the asia pacific region 
we will continue to expand our international operations and enter new international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop successfully direct and indirect international sales and support channels 
in some countries  our success will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local partners 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements with them for sales of our products 
there is a risk that we may sometimes choose the wrong partner 
for these reasons  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
international operations are subject to inherent risks  and our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors 
these include greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  certification requirements  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  political and economic instability  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  service provider and government spending patterns  and natural disasters 
such factors could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
the market for our long haul product line has substantially diminished our business was originally built on the success of our long haul optical transmission products  sentry and corestream  which allowed multiple optical signals to be combined for transmission from point to point over a single optical fiber 
during the last several years  carriers around the world  both incumbents and challengers  have laid and lit with optical equipment like ours  a substantial amount of long haul optical fiber 
this has created what appears to be an oversupply of new communications bandwidth on many long haul routes 
in addition  since the introduction of these products  technological advances have enabled the transmission of more optical signals over greater distances for less cost 
as a consequence  the market opportunity for long haul optical equipment  including ours  has declined steeply  dramatically reducing our revenues from these products 
we do not know when  if ever  the market for our long haul products will return 
our stock price is volatile our common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past  and is likely to remain volatile in the future 
volatility can arise as a result of divergence between our actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts  and announcements that we  our competitors  or our customers may make 
divergence between our actual results and our anticipated results  analyst estimates and public announcements by us  our competitors  or by customers will occur from time to time in the future  with resulting stock price volatility  irrespective of our overall year to year performance or long term prospects 
as long as we continue to depend on a limited customer base  and particularly when a substantial majority of their purchases consist of newly introduced products  there is substantial chance that our quarterly results will vary widely 
forward looking statements some of the statements contained  or incorporated by reference  in this annual report discuss future expectations  contain projections of results of operations or financial condition or state other forward looking information 
those statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements 
the forward looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions 
in some cases  you can identify these so called forward looking statements by words like may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential or continue or the negative of those words and other comparable words 
you should be aware that those statements only reflect our predictions 
actual events or results may differ substantially 
important factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the forward looking statements are disclosed throughout this report  particularly under the heading risk factors above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term and long term investment portfolio 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at october   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and if our exposure increases  adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically the company s primary exposures have been related to non dollar denominated operating expenses in europe and asia where the company sells primarily in us dollars 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency if this exposure becomes material 
as of october   the assets and liabilities of the company related to non dollar denominated currencies were not material 
therefore we do not expect an increase or decrease of in the foreign exchange rate would have a material impact on the company s financial position
