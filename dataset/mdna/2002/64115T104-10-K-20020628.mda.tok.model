overview netscout systems  inc designs  develops  manufactures  markets  sells and supports a family of integrated products that enable optimization of the performance and cost management of complex  high speed networks  including their ability to efficiently deliver critical business applications and content to end users 
netscout manufactures and markets these products in an integrated hardware and software solution suite that is used by enterprise and service provider businesses worldwide 
we manage our business as a single operating segment 
netscout was incorporated in as a consulting services company 
in  we began to develop and market its first infrastructure performance management products 
our operations have been financed principally through cash provided by operations 
on july   netscout completed its acquisition of nextpoint networks  inc the transaction was valued at approximately million 
critical accounting policies netscout considers accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories and valuation of long lived assets to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results revenue recognition product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue is recorded net of estimated product returns  which is based upon our return policy  sales agreements  management estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue  current economic trends  changes in our customer composition and historical experience 
if our judgments and estimates relating to the product returns prove to be inadequate  our financial results could be materially adversely affected in future periods 
service revenue consists primarily of fees from customer support agreements  consulting and training 
netscout generally provides three months of software support and months of hardware support as part of product sales 
revenue from software support is deferred and recognized ratably over the three month support period 
revenue from hardware support is deferred and recognized ratably over the month support period 
in addition  customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements  typically for month periods 
revenue from these agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue from consulting and training is recognized as the work is performed 
for multi element arrangements  each element of the arrangement is analyzed and a portion of the total fee under the arrangement is allocated to the undelivered elements  primarily support agreements and training  using vendor objective evidence of fair value of the element and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie  generally  hardware products and licensed software products  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element  under the residual method 
vendor objective evidence of fair value is based on the price customers pay when the element is sold separately 
license and royalty revenue consists primarily of royalties under license agreements by original equipment manufacturers who incorporate components of our data collection technology into their own products or who reproduce and sell our software products 
license revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred and when we become contractually entitled to receive license fees  provided that such fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
royalty revenue is recognized based upon product shipment by the license holder 
revenue generated from indirect distribution channels  including original equipment manufacturers  distributors  resellers  system integrators and service providers  represented  and of total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
total revenue generated from cisco systems  inc represented  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
no other customer or indirect channel partner accounted for or more of our total revenue during the fiscal years ended march   and in the past  cisco resold our probes to customers under their private label 
as of july   cisco no longer marketed or sold netscout probes under their private label  however they continued to place their backlog orders with us through december  additionally  cisco continues to incorporate components of our software technology into their products 
we will continue to collaborate with cisco on product development and marketing and to support cisco s continued distribution of our software products 
we have completed the transition of cisco customers to a direct or reseller relationship with netscout 
netscout also sees continued opportunity in our relationship with this computer networking industry leader and intend to continue increasing the sale  visibility and accelerated market acceptance of our products via this relationship worldwide 
revenue from sales outside north america represented  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
sales outside north america are primarily due to indirect channel partners  which are generally responsible for importing products and providing consulting and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
our reported international revenue does not include any revenue from sales to customers outside north america made by any of our north american based indirect channel partners 
these domestic resellers may sell netscout products to international locations  however  netscout still reports these shipments as north america revenue since netscout ships the products to a domestic location 
netscout expects revenue from sales outside north america to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts 
our normal payment terms are net days 
we monitor all payments from our customers and assess any collection issues as they arise 
management believes its credit policies are prudent and reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
at march  and  one customer accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our accounts receivable 
historically  we have not experienced any significant non performance by our customers nor do we anticipate non performance by our customers in the future and  accordingly  do not require collateral from our customers 
we perform full credit checks on all potential new customers prior to acceptance of the order 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for possible losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make their required payments and any losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management estimates of the un collectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and customer concentrations when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates are made when establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if our judgments and estimates relating to the allowance for doubtful accounts prove to be inadequate  our financial results could be materially adversely affected in future periods 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at actual cost 
inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods 
many components that are necessary for the assembly of our probes are obtained from separate sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components 
generally  we do not maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers or large volumes of inventory 
our inability to obtain adequate deliveries or the occurrence of any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of these components would affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis 
this could damage relationships with current and prospective customers  cause shortfalls in expected revenue and could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  thereby adversely effecting our financial condition and results of operations 
inventories are reduced by a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
management regularly monitors our inventories for potential obsolete and excess inventory 
our reserve for obsolete and excess inventory is based upon management s estimated forecasts of unit sales and estimated timing and impact of new product introductions 
management considers historical product demand  current economic trends  expected market acceptance of our products and expected customer buying patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made when establishing the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
if our judgments and estimates relating to obsolete and excess inventory prove to be inadequate  our financial results could be materially adversely affected in future periods 
valuation of long lived assets netscout regularly performs reviews on the carrying value of our long term assets to determine if any impairment is present 
items which could trigger impairment could include but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to historical product demand  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and significant decline in our technological value compared to the market 
management considers historical product demand  current economic trends  customer buying patterns  customer credit worthiness and expected revenue projections when estimating expected future cash flows 
no such impairment has been indicated to date 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made when establishing criteria for future cash flows 
if our judgments and estimates relating to long term assets prove to be inadequate  our financial results could be materially adversely affected in future periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenue of certain line items included in our statements of operations netscout systems  inc

product revenues were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales  which was attributable to the continued slowdown in network management capital spending in many large enterprises as a result of the economic downturn  offset by an increase in the average selling price of attributable to the sale of our higher end probes 
it is unknown what effect the tight capital spending controls in the us and abroad will continue to have on this economic downturn and what impact  if any  it will have on our future product revenue results 
service 
service revenues were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of customer support agreements attributable to new product sales generated in recent reporting periods combined with continued renewals of customer support agreements from our continually expanding installed base 
license and royalty 
license and royalty revenues were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to this decrease corresponded with the continued slowdown in network management capital spending as a result of the economic downturn

cost of revenue and gross margin product 
cost of product revenue consists primarily of components  personnel costs  media duplication  manuals  packaging materials  licensed technology fees and overhead 
cost of product revenue was million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to this decrease corresponds with the decrease in product revenue attributable to the overall current slowdown in network management capital spending in many large enterprises as a result of the economic downturn 
product gross margins were and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin was mainly caused by an increase in fixed manufacturing costs  which was allocated over the decreased number of units during the fiscal year 
service 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of personnel costs  material and consulting costs 
cost of service revenues were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to service gross margins were and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
this increase in cost was primarily due to an increase in our personnel costs  partially offset by a decrease in consulting costs 
while cost of service revenue increased by  service revenue itself increased by  thereby improving our gross margin 
gross margins were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to gross margin percentage was for each of the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in margin dollars was primarily due to the decrease in unit sales attributable to the overall current slowdown in network management spending in many large enterprises as a result of the economic downturn 
gross margin is primarily affected by the mix of product  service  license and royalty revenue and by the proportion of sales through direct versus indirect distribution channels 
we realize significantly higher gross margins on license and royalty revenue relative to product and service revenue 
we typically realize higher gross margins on direct sales relative to indirect distribution channel sales

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  fees for outside consultants and related costs associated with the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
research and development expenses were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to this increase was primarily due to a increase in personnel costs from to  attributable to the acquisition of nextpoint  the impact of a full year of personnel costs related to employees hired during fiscal year and the reclassification of certain job functions 
in addition there was a increase of stock based compensation charges related to the nextpoint acquisition from to we anticipate that we will decrease research and development expenses in absolute dollars in the near future as we continue to maintain tight spending controls during the current economic downturn 
we will continue to monitor the economic situation and will resume growth of our development investment once we again achieve revenue and profit growth 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and costs associated with marketing programs such as trade shows  seminars  advertising and new product launch activities 
sales and marketing expenses were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in marketing programs spending and a decrease in travel expenses by as a result of a concerted expense control program and a decline in recruiting expenses of from to we anticipate that we will commit additional resources to sales and marketing in the future and that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars year over year in our continued effort to promote revenue growth and netscout name recognition

we believe that our current cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if demand for our product were to decrease substantially there could be a material effect on our ability to generate cash flow sufficient for our short term working capital and expenditure needs 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of the goodwill s impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is after june  the provisions of sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will be adopted by the company  as required  in the first quarter of fiscal year on april   netscout reclassified the remaining un amortized assembled workforce intangible asset to goodwill and ceased amortization of goodwill 
netscout does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impairment impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no

certain factors which may affect future results our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
except for the historical information in this report  the matters contained in this report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report 
additional risks that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a reduction in orders from customers of cisco systems  inc 
could materially adversely affect our business 
although cisco continues to incorporate some of our software into their products  as of july   cisco no longer sold our probes to third parties under its private label 
cisco did  however  continue to place their backlog orders with us through december  by selling our probes under their private label  cisco accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we now sell to cisco customers  both directly or through indirect channel partners but if we are unable to continue to sell our products directly or through indirect channel partners to customers of cisco in the future  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
a termination of our strategic relationship with cisco may materially adversely affect our business 
our strategic relationship with cisco provides us with early insight into the development of new technologies 
additionally  cisco incorporates some of our software in their products and provides license and royalty revenue to netscout 
license and royalty revenue and other revenue from software sales to cisco accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
cisco may decide to cease purchasing our software and or to internally develop products that compete with our solutions or partner with our competitors or bundle or sell competitors solutions  possibly at lower prices 
if our strategic relationship with cisco were terminated or further adversely affected for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter  and therefore  this revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our operating results for that quarter 
our quarterly revenue may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including the following current technology spending by actual and potential customers  the market for network management solutions is in an early stage of development and therefore  demand for our solutions may be uneven  the timing and receipt of orders from customers  especially in light of our lengthy sales cycle  the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  distribution channels through which our products are sold could change  the timing of hiring sales personnel and the speed at which such personnel become productive  we may not be able to anticipate or adapt effectively to developing markets and rapidly changing technologies  our prices or the prices of our competitors products may change  and economic slowdowns and the occurrence of unforeseeable events  such as the tragic events of september   which contribute to such slowdowns 
we operate with minimal backlog because our products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent upon orders booked and shipped in that quarter and revenue for any future quarter is not predictable to any degree of certainty 
therefore  any significant deferral of orders for our products would cause a shortfall in revenue for that quarter 
our continued growth depends on our ability to expand our sales force 
we must increase the size of our sales force in order to increase our direct sales and support our indirect sales channels 
because our products are very technical  sales people require a long period of time to become productive  typically three to twelve months 
this lag in productivity  as well as the challenge of attracting qualified candidates  may make it difficult to meet our sales force growth targets 
further  we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from growing our sales force 
if we are unable to successfully expand our sales capability  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our success depends on our ability to manage indirect distribution channels 
sales to our indirect distribution channels accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
while cisco no longer resold our probes as of july   they did continue to place backlog orders with us through december  cisco accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
to increase our sales  in addition to growing our direct sales model  we must develop new and further expand and manage existing indirect distribution channels  including original equipment manufacturers  distributors  resellers  systems integrators and service providers 
our indirect channel partners have no obligation to purchase any products from us 
in addition  they could internally develop products  which compete with our solutions or partner with our competitors or bundle or resell competitors solutions  possibly at lower prices 
the potential inability to develop new relationships and to expand and manage our existing relationships with partners  the potential inability or unwillingness of our partners to effectively market and sell our products or the loss of existing partnerships could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to introduce new products and enhance our existing products to keep up with rapid technological change  demand for our products may decline 
the market for network management solutions is relatively new and is characterized by rapid changes in technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements 
our success is dependent upon our ability to meet our customers needs  which are driven by changes in computer networking technologies and the emergence of new industry standards 
in addition  new technologies may shorten the life cycle for our products or could render our existing or planned products obsolete 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new network and application infrastructure performance management products or enhancements to existing products in a timely and successful manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our reliance on sole source suppliers could adversely affect our business 
many components that are necessary for the assembly of our probes are obtained from separate sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers 
these components include some of our network interface cards  which are produced for us solely by sbs technologies  inc  syskonnect  inc  adaptec  inc  and jni 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components 
we do not generally maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers or large volumes of inventory 
our inability to obtain adequate deliveries or the occurrence of any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of these components would affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis 
this could damage relationships with current and prospective customers  cause shortfalls in expected revenue and could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face significant competition from other technology companies 
the market for network management solutions is intensely competitive 
we believe customers make network management system purchasing decisions based primarily upon the following factors product performance  functionality and price  name and reputation of vendor  distribution strength  and alliances with industry partners 
we compete with providers of network performance management solutions  such as concord communications  inc and providers of portable network traffic analyzers and probes  such as network associates  inc in addition  leading network equipment providers could offer their own or competitors solutions in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  management  marketing  service  support  technical  distribution and other resources than we do 
therefore  they may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
as a result of these and other factors  we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the success of our business depends on the continued growth in the market for and the commercial acceptance of network management solutions 
we derive all of our revenue from the sale of products and services that are designed to allow our customers to manage the performance of computer networks 
the market for network management solutions is in an early stage of development 
therefore  we cannot accurately assess the size of the market and may be unable to predict the appropriate features and prices for products to address the market  the optimal distribution strategy and the competitive environment that will develop 
in order for us to be successful  our potential customers must recognize the value of more sophisticated network management solutions  decide to invest in the management of their networks and  in particular  adopt our management solutions 
any failure of this market to continue to develop would materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
businesses may choose to outsource the management of their networks to service providers 
our business may depend on our ability to develop relationships with these service providers and successfully market our products to them 
failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 
the growth in size and complexity of our business and our customer base has been and will continue to be a challenge to our management and operations 
to manage further growth effectively  we must enhance our financial information and accounting systems and controls  integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  our costs  the quality of our products  the effectiveness of our sales organization  and our ability to retain key personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of anil singhal  our president  chief executive officer and co founder  and narendra popat  our chairman of the board and co founder 
we also depend on the ability of our other executive officers and senior managers to work effectively as a team 
the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must hire and retain skilled personnel 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel  software engineers  and technical support personnel 
we have had difficulty hiring and retaining these highly skilled employees in the past 
if we are unable to attract and retain the highly skilled technical personnel that are integral to our sales  marketing  product development and customer support teams  the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements may be limited 
this inability could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
our business is heavily dependent on our intellectual property 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and non disclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
the reverse engineering  unauthorized copying  or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without compensating us 
legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of uncertainty 
in addition  legal proceedings may divert management s attention from growing our business 
there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information  or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use by third parties and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
further  we also license software from third parties for use as part of our products  and if any of these licenses were to terminate  we may experience delays in product shipment until we develop or license alternative software 
others may claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to claims by others that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights 
these claims  whether or not valid  could require us to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product shipments  reengineer our products or acquire licenses to such third party intellectual property 
we may not be able to secure any required licenses on commercially reasonable terms or secure them at all 
we expect that these claims could become more frequent as more companies enter the market for network and application infrastructure performance management solutions 
any of these claims or resulting events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our products contain errors  they may be costly to correct  revenue may be delayed  we could be sued and our reputation could be harmed 
despite testing by our customers and us  errors may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
if errors are discovered  we may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  we may need to make significant expenditures of capital resources in order to eliminate errors and failures 
errors and failures in our products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation 
if one or more of our products fail  a customer may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
the occurrence or discovery of these types of errors or failures could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to expand and manage our international operations 
sales outside north america accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the twelve months ended march  and we currently expect international revenue to continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenue in the future 
we believe that we must continue to expand our international sales activities in order to be successful 
our international sales growth will be limited if we are unable to expand international indirect distribution channels  hire additional sales personnel  adapt products for local markets  and manage geographically dispersed operations 
the major countries outside of north america  in which we do  or intend to do business  are the united kingdom  germany  japan and china 
our international operations  including our operations in the united kingdom  germany  japan and china  are generally subject to a number of risks  including failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection as the laws in the united states provide against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  dependence on local indirect channel partners  multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and political and economic instability 
the price of our common stock may decrease due to market volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated significantly since the initial public offering of our common stock on august  the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the market prices of securities of technology companies have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
also  broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
recently  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have occasionally instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issues that stock 
if any of our stockholders brought such a lawsuit against us  even if the lawsuit is without merit  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider all highly liquid marketable securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are stated at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
long term marketable securities are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices 
cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments and us treasury bills 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material effect on the value of our cash equivalents 
the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s exposure to interest rates based on outstanding debt has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that although the company currently has a million line of credit with million of letters of credit secured against it  it has no amounts outstanding under the line and no other outstanding interest bearing debt 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on inter company transactions was immaterial for the twelve months ended march  currently  the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
effective january  there is a single currency within certain countries of the european union  known as the euro  and one organization  the european central bank  responsible for setting european monetary policy 
we have reviewed the impact the euro has on our business and whether this gives rise to a need for significant changes in our commercial operations or treasury management functions 
because our transactions are denominated in us dollars  we do not believe that the euro conversion or any other currency exchange will have any material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
