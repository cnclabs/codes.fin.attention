item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide market research  polling and consulting services to a broad range of companies  non profit organizations and governmental agencies 
since  we have provided these services utilizing traditional market research and polling methodologies  such as direct mail  telephone based surveys  mall intercepts  focus groups and in person interviews 
in september  we began developing our internet panel and building the technology infrastructure to provide online market research and polling services 
in november  we introduced our first internet based market research and polling products and services 
we generally perform traditional and internet based custom research services on a fixed fee basis in response to client generated requests 
we sell our multi client research products on a periodic subscription basis  typically annually 
harris interactive service bureau performs research for other market research firms on a project by project basis in response to requests from those firms 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the most significant of these involving difficult or complex judgements in include o revenue recognition  o provision for uncollectible accounts  o valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and other long lived assets  o realizability of deferred tax assets  and o hi points loyalty program 
in each situation  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
revenues under fixed fee arrangements are recognized on a percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
these revenues include amounts billed to our clients to cover subcontractor costs and other direct expenses 
provisions for estimated contract losses  if any  is made in the period such losses are determined 
subscription revenues are recognized upon delivery of the research product 
revisions to estimated costs and differences between actual contract losses and estimated contract losses would effect both the timing of revenue allocated and the results of operations of the company 
we consider all of the revenues from a project to be internet based whenever or more of the surveys used in the completed project were completed by online panelists over the internet 
the company maintains provisions for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company assesses the carrying value of its identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market trends 
in the event that the carrying value of assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the company would record an adjustment to the respective carrying value 
with respect to goodwill  the company will complete its impairment test on an annual basis 
the company evaluates the valuation allowance and the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in the determination of the valuation allowance  the company has considered future taxable income 
should the company determine that it is more likely than not that it will realize certain of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance and increase income 
the company has implemented a loyalty program whereby points are awarded to survey respondents who register for the company s online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join the online panel 
the earned points  which are non transferable  may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio 
the company estimated the redemption rate of the points based on research from other loyalty and retention programs 
an actual redemption rate that differs from this estimated redemption rate may have a material impact on the results of operations of the company 
business combinations on november  the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock  par value 
per share  of total research corporation total research  a delaware corporation  headquartered in princeton  new jersey  pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  dated as of august   among the company  total merger sub inc  a delaware corporation and direct  wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and total research 
pursuant to the merger agreement  total merger sub was merged with and into total research the merger  with total research continuing as the surviving corporation and as a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
harris interactive and total research are engaged in complementary businesses in the market research and polling industry 
the acquisition is expected to create opportunities for revenue growth  cost savings and other synergies including the ability to convert total research traditional based clients to the internet  sell to one another s customers  offer customers more comprehensive and diverse products and services  use a combined worldwide network  and pursue jointly future acquisitions 
consequently  the acquisition is intended to result in increased value for stockholders 
the preliminary results of our first seven months of combined operations lead us to believe that our expectations were correct 
upon consummation of the merger  each outstanding share of total research common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of harris interactive common stock  par value 
per share 
an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock  with an estimated fair value of million  was issued to the stockholders of total research corporation 
the value was determined using the average fair market value of the stock for the range of trading days beginning august  and ending august  additionally  pursuant to the merger agreement  all outstanding options to purchase shares of total research common stock were  upon consummation of the merger  fully vested and converted into an option to purchase shares of harris interactive common stock 
as a result  the former option holders of total research received from harris interactive options to purchase approximately  shares of harris interactive common stock  with an estimated fair value of million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with fas and is included in the company s financial statements commencing on november  the company recorded approximately million in goodwill and intangibles related to the acquisition in accordance with the provisions of sfas see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
in september   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of m a create limited  a privately owned company headquartered in tokyo  japan  in consideration of a combination of cash and shares of harris interactive common stock 
additionally  in august   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of market research solutions limited  a privately owned uk company  headquartered in oxford  england  in consideration of a combination of cash and shares of harris interactive common stock 
restructuring and asset impairment charge during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a restructuring and asset write down charge of million directly related to the operational integration of harris interactive and total research 
management developed a formal plan that included a reduction in harris interactive staff of the full time workforce in rochester  ny  new york  ny  norwalk  ct and a few other outlying locations 
the affected employees were mainly support staff with overlapping functions in the combined company 
other integration actions included the closing of our telephone center located in youngstown  oh and offices in new york  ny and chicago  il which resulted in asset write downs and lease commitments at these locations 
the plan was formally communicated to the affected employees during the second fiscal quarter 
as a result of the restructuring  the company realized approximately million in non cash savings and million in cash savings in fiscal the company estimates non cash savings of approximately million and cash savings of approximately million  in fiscal the following table summarizes activity with respect to the restructuring and asset impairment charge for the period ended june  asset lease severance write downs commitments total in thousands net charge fiscal     asset write downs during   cash payments during   remaining reserve at june    as of june   all actions have been completed  however cash payments for severance and lease commitments will be made on a longer term basis according to the contractually scheduled payments of such commitments 
cash payments on the leases will continue through total number of employees included in the charge was all have been terminated as of june  with the balance of severance to be paid in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated our results of operations expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended june  revenues from services cost of services gross margin internet database development expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses restructuring charges and asset impairment operating loss interest and other income  net net loss before taxes income taxes net loss fiscal as compared to fiscal revenues from services 
revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the revenue growth was mainly due to the acquisitions of total research in november of fiscal  the yankelovich custom research group in february of fiscal  market research solutions limited and m a create limited in august of fiscal in fiscal  the company also increased internet based revenues to million  from million in fiscal acquiring new internet based revenue as well as converting existing  traditional work to the internet drove this increase 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal  from in fiscal the margins declined mainly because a large majority of the acquired revenue was generated from traditional research 
internet database development 
internet database development costs declined million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due to a number of factors o the primary building of the us database was completed last year  o the price to acquire double opt in names for database replenishment dropped precipitously this year  and o we terminated our panel recruitment agreement with excite home 
in addition  the prior year expense included costs associated with the planet project global poll conducted in november sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million for fiscal  or of revenue  compared with million  or of revenue for fiscal the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses resulting from the acquisition of total research and an increase in sales commission expense 
the improvement as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the company s continuing efforts to reduce overall costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue in fiscal  compared with million  or of revenue in fiscal similar to sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses have increased in absolute dollars due to increased personnel and related costs  including rent and depreciation expense  resulting from the acquisition of total research 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue is directly attributable to continuing cost reduction efforts 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income totaled million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a lower average marketable securities balance for fiscal as compared to the prior year 
fiscal as compared to fiscal revenues from services 
aggregate revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the incremental revenue generated from the yankelovich custom research group acquired effective february   supplemented by increased usage of our internet based market research products and services  which contributed million to total revenue in fiscal  a increase over the prior year 
additionally  total revenues were negatively impacted by the economic slowdown that year 
internet revenue constituted of total revenues in fiscal as compared to of total revenues in fiscal this increase was dampened by the impact of the revenue mix acquired from yankelovich which  prior to its acquisition by us  conducted virtually all of its research using traditional methodologies 
however  as a percent of total revenue  internet revenue for yankelovich totaled during the fourth quarter of fiscal  its first full quarter since being acquired 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  primarily due to the continuing expansion of internet related business relative to overall revenue growth 
internet database development 
database development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase over fiscal was primarily due to the planet project global poll initiative  a four day  worldwide poll conducted in november  across all continents in eight languages 
this survey was the largest of its type ever conducted  greatly increased our knowledge and expertise related to global research  and added modestly to the number of cooperative online respondents worldwide 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly to million  or of revenue in fiscal compared to million  or of revenue  in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in marketing expenses  with a focus on specific products  as well as the company wide initiative to reduce overall spending 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenue in fiscal from million  or of revenue in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased staffing and occupancy expenses associated with new hires  and higher costs associated with our development of new products  services and technologies for the internet 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a higher average marketable securities balance during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years we have financed our operations primarily through the million of net proceeds generated from our december initial public offering 
consequently  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were million at june   million at june   and million at june  the company maintains a line of credit with a commercial bank providing borrowings up to million in fiscal and fiscal at prime 
the prime rate in effect at june  was 
borrowings under this arrangement are due upon demand 
there were no borrowings under this agreement at june  and june  the line of credit is collateralized by the assets of the company 
as of june   the company had short term and long term borrowings of million and million  respectively  limited to operations in the united kingdom and japan 
interest rates related to the borrowings range from to with maturity dates extending to there are no restrictive covenants associated with these borrowings 
net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal net cash used in operating activities in each of these periods was primarily the result of net losses 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal during fiscal  net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of million were partially offset by the million cash outflow for transaction related costs to acquire total research in november during fiscal  net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of million were partially offset by the million cash outflow to purchase the custom research division of yankelovichpartners  inc in february fiscal and capital expenditures of million and million  respectively  primarily supported the development of our internet infrastructure 
during fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was attributable to the purchase of investment securities with the proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock  pending the use of these proceeds for working capital  expansion of our internet panel  and development of new technologies  products  and services 
additionally  capital expenditures associated with our internet infrastructure development and facilities expansion were million 
net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily related to the paydown of long term debt and the repurchase of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  resulting from issuances of common stock and stock options  offset by the repurchase of common stock 
during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million 
in fiscal  our financing activities primarily consisted of the issuance of common stock in connection with the initial public offering completed in december  with net proceeds of million  as well as a private placement of our class b preferred stock with net proceeds of million 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products and services  the resources we allocate to the continuing development of our internet infrastructure and internet panel  marketing and selling of our services  our promotional activities and other factors 
management anticipates continuing expenditures for property  plant and equipment and working capital requirements throughout fiscal at levels consistent with fiscal based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we cannot be certain  however  that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be accurate 
if our operating results were to fail to meet our expectations or if accounts receivable or other assets were to require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financing or other arrangements 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements sfas in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets to be held and used  to be disposed of other than by sale and to be disposed of by sale 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years  and will thus be adopted by the company  as required  on july  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when it is incurred and measured initially at fair value 
this new guidance will impact the timing of recognition and the initial measurement of the amount of liabilities the company recognizes in connection with exit or disposal activities initiated after december   the effective date of sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
risk factors if the marketplace does not continue to convert to internet based market research and polling  our growth will be adversely affected 
the continued success of our business will depend on our ability to continue to develop and market internet based products and services that achieve broad market acceptance 
clients must continue to accept the internet as an attractive replacement for traditional market research methodologies  such as direct mail  telephone based surveys  mall intercepts  focus groups and in person interviews 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have expended million and significant management resources in the development and growth of our internet based market research and polling business 
we have experienced resistance from some of our clients regarding our internet based market research and polling methodologies 
these clients have expressed concern that internet users do not yet accurately reflect their applicable population  and any resulting information will be inherently biased toward the views  experiences and attitudes of an unrepresentative group 
if our current and potential clients do not accept our internet based methodologies as reliable and unbiased  our revenues may not meet expectations or may decline  and our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer 
we must continue to attract and retain highly skilled employees 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  sales and client support personnel 
competition for these personnel exists  and we may be unable to attract  integrate or retain the proper numbers of sufficiently qualified personnel that our business plan assumes 
we have experienced in the past  and we may experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications 
our past difficulties in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees have resulted in additional costs for recruitment  compensation and relocation or the provision of remote access to our facilities 
to the extent that we are unable to hire and retain skilled employees in the future  our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer 
we have incurred losses in recent years 
since the beginning of fiscal through year end fiscal  we have expended approximately million to develop and maintain our internet capabilities  comprising of approximately million to develop our internet panel and approximately million to develop and maintain our technology infrastructure 
consequently  we incurred net losses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we base current and future expense levels on our operating plans and our estimates of future revenues 
while we were profitable in the fourth quarter of fiscal  if our revenues grow at a slower rate than we anticipate  or if our spending levels exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted to reflect slower revenue growth  we may not be able to maintain profitability 
even if we are profitable in the future  we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
variations in our operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have in the past  and may in the future  fluctuate significantly 
our future results of operations may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
factors that are outside of our control  and that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past or that may affect us in the future  include o a general decline in the demand for market research and polling products and services  o seasonal decreases in demand for market research and polling services during the summer and year end vacation and holiday periods  o development of parity or superior products and services by our competitors  o technical difficulties that cause general and long term failure of the internet  and o declines in general economic conditions or the budgets of our clients 
factors that are within our control  and that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past or that may affect us in the future  include o our relative mix of internet based and traditional market research and polling businesses  o technical difficulties that negatively affect our operations  o our ability to maintain the proper critical mass and scope of our internet panel necessary to develop and sell new products and services and generate expected revenues  o our ability to recruit respondents into our sub panels  such as our it decision makers  to conduct high value research for our clients  and o development of new  marketable products and services the factors listed above may affect both our quarter to quarter operating results as well as our long term success 
you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance or any trend in our performance 
if we are unable to maintain adequate size and demographic composition of our internet panel  or if we are required to spend substantial funds to do so  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our success is highly dependent on our ability to obtain and retain an adequate number of panelists in our internet panel and its sub panels 
our ability to maintain an adequate online panel or increase internet revenues may be harmed if o a significant number of our current online panelists decide that they are no longer willing to participate in our surveys  o we lose a large number of online panelists from over use  and then must rely on a limited number of online panelists for ongoing research  and o we are unable to attract an adequate number of replacement panelists and subpanelists 
if the number of our survey respondents significantly decreases  or the demographic composition of our internet panel narrows  our ability to provide our clients with accurate and statistically projectable information would likely suffer 
this risk is likely to increase as our business expands 
for example  our internet panel is surveyed for our own studies as well as for studies conducted for other market research firms by our harris interactive service bureau 
our business cannot grow and will suffer if we have an insufficient number of panelists to respond to our surveys  or if our panel becomes unreliable due to reduced size  or because it is not representative of the general population 
our online panelists are not obligated to participate in our surveys and polls and there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so 
we believe our hi points and hi stakes programs currently appear to provide adequate incentives to encourage participation in our surveys and to maintain the size of our internet panel 
these programs may lose their effectiveness in the future  resulting in the reduction in size of the panel 
we may not be able to compete successfully 
the markets for our products and services are highly competitive 
our current competitors also offer internet based and traditional market research and polling services 
we expect to face future competition from other organizations that develop internet related products and services 
these companies may  either alone or in alliances with other firms  penetrate the internet based market research and polling market 
we do not believe that there are currently any dominant competitors in the internet based market research and polling market 
however  many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial and marketing resources 
these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their services  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential employees  strategic partners and customers 
further  our competitors and potential competitors may develop technologies that are superior to ours  or that achieve greater market acceptance than our own 
the above factors  either alone or in combination  would likely result in a loss of market share and reduced levels of revenue and profitability 
potential acquisitions of  or investments in  other companies may not be available and or have a negative impact on our business 
as part of our continued strategy to expand our internet panel  our technology infrastructure and our products and services  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  services  products or technologies if appropriate opportunities arise 
however  we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms 
the material risks involved with acquisitions are o the difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired business  o the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  o the availability of favorable acquisition financing  and o the potential loss of key employees and or customers of any acquired business 
acquisitions may require the use of significant amounts of cash  resulting in the inability to use those funds for other business purposes 
acquisitions using our capital stock could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our capital stock  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
amortization of intangible assets would reduce our earnings  which in turn could negatively influence the price of our common stock 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could disrupt our operations and result in loss of revenues 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key technical and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of any of these persons could seriously harm our business 
although some of our key employees have signed non competitive agreements  none of our officers  other than albert a 
angrisani  or key employees is bound by an employment agreement  and our relationships with our officers and key employees are at will 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees other than gordon s 
black 
we are growing rapidly  and may not be able to effectively manage and support that growth 
we have grown rapidly and will need to continue to grow in all areas of our operations to execute our business strategy 
managing and sustaining our growth will place significant demands on management as well as on our administrative  operational  technical and financial systems and controls 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may have to divert resources away from the continued growth of our business and the implementation of our business strategy 
if we do not continue to keep pace with rapid technological change and the intense competition of the market research and polling industry  we will not be able to successfully implement our business plan 
the market research and polling industry is characterized by intense competition  frequent new products and service introductions and evolving methodologies 
the continued growth of the internet amplifies these market characteristics 
to succeed  we will need to develop and integrate effectively the various software programs  technologies and methodologies required to enhance and improve our market research product and service offerings and manage our business 
any enhancements or new services or products must meet the requirements of our current and potential clients and achieve significant market acceptance 
our success also will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of our products and services 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new products and services 
we could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure to adapt to these changes 
any failure in the performance of our internet based technology infrastructure could harm our business and our reputation 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure  that causes an interruption in our ability to communicate with our internet panel or in our ability to collect research data could result in reduced revenue  and could impair our reputation 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  earthquake  flooding  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins and similar events 
verio co location  a secure  off site web hosting facility  currently maintains approximately one third of our servers at its facility in rochester  new york 
we depend upon them to protect our systems and operations from the events described above 
we have experienced technical difficulties with downtime of individual components of our computer system in the past and believe that technical difficulties and downtime may continue to occur from time to time in the future 
to date  technical difficulties and downtime have had minimal impact on our operations and have usually been corrected within several hours to forty eight hours 
their impact may be more severe in the future 
we have no formal disaster recovery plan and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to failures in our systems 
in addition  our servers and software must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic 
any increase in demands on our servers beyond that which we currently anticipate  will require us to fund the expansion and modification of our network infrastructure 
if we were unable to add additional software and hardware to accommodate increased demand  unanticipated system disruptions and slower data collection would likely result 
moreover  our internet panel members communicate with us using various internet service providers 
these providers have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties unrelated to our systems in the future 
while the impact of these outages in the past has been minimal  any future system delays or failures of service providers to our internet panel could adversely affect our access to our online panelists  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure or inability to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business 
our success and ability to compete substantially depend on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
we have trademark registrations for a number of our trademarks  including harris interactive and the harris poll 
if we were prevented from using the harris poll name  our brand recognition and business would likely suffer 
we would have to make substantial financial commitments to promote and rebuild our brand identity and loyalty with our clients and members of our internet panel and re implement our website 
currently  we have pending trademark applications for a number of our products and services 
we also have patent applications currently pending for our conceptloc encryption system and our system and method for conducting product configuration research over a computer based network 
in addition  we may apply for additional trademarks or patents in the future 
our patent or trademark applications may not be approved  or if approved  our patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
if our patent or trademark applications are not approved because third parties own these patents or trademarks  our use of these patents or trademarks would be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with the third party owners  which might not be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we generally enter confidentiality or license agreements with parties with whom we do business  and generally control access to  and distribution of  our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our technologies 
the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we also rely on off the shelf technologies that we license from third parties 
off the shelf technology refers to generally commercially available software that is not customized for a particular user 
these third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the inability to use licensed technology important to our business could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost 
in the future  we may seek to license additional technology to enhance our current technology infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that any such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of any of these technology licenses could result in delays in providing our products and services until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
possible intellectual property infringement claims by third parties could be costly 
we cannot guarantee that infringement or other claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future  whether resulting from our internally developed intellectual property or licenses or content from third parties 
any future assertions or prosecutions could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to pay money damages  introduce new trademarks  develop non infringing technology  or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
any of those events could substantially increase our operating expenses and potentially reduce our expected revenues 
these royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
our ability to execute our business strategy will suffer if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we are unable to introduce new trademarks  develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis 
moreover  our general liability insurance may not cover  or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred  in defense of potential trademark infringement claims  or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any difficulty in accessing additional capital may prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund the expansion of our internet panel and the marketing of our products and services  or to acquire complementary businesses  technologies or services 
any required additional financing may be unavailable on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  current stockholders will experience dilution  which may be significant  to their ownership interest  and such securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if additional financing is not available when required  or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund the development and expansion of our business  promote our brand name successfully  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is largely dependent on the continued development and worldwide growth of the internet 
the internet may not grow  or if it does grow  may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this growth 
if worldwide internet usage does not continue to grow  we may be unable to attract international online panelists to our internet panel or clients for our internet based market research and polling products and services 
if internet usage does continue to grow  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
varying factors could inhibit future growth or the ability of the internet infrastructure to adequately support the growth in internet usage  including o inadequate network infrastructure  o security concerns  o inconsistent quality of service  and o unavailability of cost effective  high speed service 
our internet panel depends on internet service providers  online service providers and other website operators for access to the internet and our websites 
many websites have experienced interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
nua ltd  of dublin  ireland  a company that specializes in measuring global online populations  reported that the total number of worldwide users who had access to the internet during the month of may but did not necessarily log on  was approximately million or about of the world population  an increase of almost from one year ago million and an increase of over from two years ago million 
if worldwide internet usage declines  or grows at a significantly slower rate than projected  our ability to maintain our current internet panel  expand our global internet panel and gather research data and information around the world will decrease  which would likely harm our business financial condition and results of operations 
changes in government regulation or industry practices could limit our internet activities or result in additional costs of doing business on the internet 
the internet tax freedom act prohibits states or political subdivisions from imposing taxes on internet access  unless imposed and enforced prior to october   and multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce during the period beginning october  the internet tax freedom act also created the advisory commission on electronic commerce to examine tax laws that impact electronic commerce 
any new laws pertaining to the imposition of taxes on internet access and electronic commerce could adversely affect our business 
in february  the federal communications commission issued a declaratory ruling interpreting the telecommunications act of to allow local exchange carriers to receive reciprocal compensation for traffic delivered to information service providers  particularly internet service providers  on the basis that traffic bound for internet service providers is largely interstate 
as a result of this ruling  the costs of transmitting data over the internet may increase and our business could suffer 
there are currently few laws or regulations that specifically regulate communications on the internet 
however  we expect more stringent laws and regulations to be enacted both in the united states and on a global basis  due to the increasing popularity and worldwide use of the internet 
any new legislation or regulations or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet could limit our effectiveness in conducting internet based market research and polling  and increase our operating expenses 
in addition  the application of existing laws to the internet could expose us to substantial liability for which we might not be indemnified by content providers or other third parties 
existing laws and regulations currently address  and new laws and regulations and industry self regulatory initiatives are likely to address  a variety of issues  including the following o email distribution  o user privacy and expression  o the rights and safety of children  o intellectual property  o information security  o anti competitive practices  o the convergence of traditional channels with internet commerce  o taxation and pricing  and o the characteristics and quality of products and services 
those laws that do reference the internet have limited interpretation by the courts and their applicability and scope are not well defined  particularly on an international basis 
any new laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect our business 
industry standards related to the internet are still evolving 
moreover  some private entities have proposed their own standards for communications with  and use of information related to  individuals who use the internet 
internet service providers also have the ability to disrupt our communications with our panel 
although we believe that we maintain the highest standards for the recruitment of members into our database  communications with our panelists and use of information provided by our respondents  some service providers and or self appointed industry regulators may not agree 
as a result  our communications with our panelists may be disrupted from time to time 
internet security concerns could hinder internet communications and our ability to obtain sufficient and reliable responses from our online panelists 
historically  the capability to securely transmit confidential information has been a significant barrier to communications over the internet 
internet security concerns could cause some online panelists to reduce their participation levels  provide inaccurate responses or end their membership in our internet panel 
this could harm our credibility with our current clients 
if our clients become dissatisfied  they may stop using our products and services 
in addition  dissatisfied and lost clients could damage our reputation 
a loss of online panelists or a loss of clients would hurt our efforts to generate increased revenues 
we are susceptible to breaches of database security 
a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate the personal information of our online panelists 
as a result  we may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
liability arising from the use of the personal information of our internet panel could be costly 
we could be subject to liability claims by our online panelists for any misuse of personal information 
these claims could result in costly litigation 
in addition  the federal trade commission and other domestic and international agencies have been investigating various internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
we could incur additional costs and expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if our privacy practices are investigated 
if we are unable to achieve the anticipated global growth of our internet panel  or if we are unable to overcome other risks associated with global operations  we will be unable to conduct business on a global level 
key components of our strategy are extension of our internet based market research and polling products and services to clients globally  expansion of our internet panel to include global online panelists and development of strategic alliances globally 
the following risks are inherent in doing business on a global level o export controls relating to encryption technology  o more restrictive privacy laws  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o lower penetration of internet use globally  which may effect our ability to obtain international panel members  o currency exchange fluctuations  o problems in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  o potentially adverse tax consequences  o political instability  o internet access restrictions  o terrorist activity against american interests abroad  and o ability to attract a critical mass of panel members in key countries and regions 
we have little or no control over these risks 
we have encountered more restrictive privacy laws in connection with our business operations in europe  which have inhibited our ability to develop our european internet panel 
we have also experienced currency exchange fluctuations  the impact of which has not been material 
as we increase our global operations in the future  we may experience some or all of these risks  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to liability for publishing or distributing content over the internet 
we may be subject to claims relating to content that is published on or downloaded from our websites 
we also could be subject to liability for content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type  such as defamation or trademark infringement  or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
in addition  any claims of this type  with or without merit  would result in the diversion of our financial resources and management personnel 
the price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile and these securities may be overvalued 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations 
if financial operating results do not improve or improve at a slower rate than we anticipate  or if operating or capital expenditures exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly  or if some other event adversely affects us  the market price of our common stock would decline 
in addition  if the market for internet related stocks or the stock market in general experiences an additional loss in investor confidence or declines further  the market price of our common stock could fall for reasons unrelated to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
investors might be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the purchase price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were to become the subject of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
anti takeover provisions in our charter could delay or prevent an acquisition of the company 
our restated certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our board of directors into three classes and provides our board of directors with the power to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
this preferred stock could have voting rights  including voting rights that could be superior to that of our common stock  and the board of directors has the power to determine these voting rights 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law contains provisions that impose restrictions on stockholder action to acquire our company 
the effect of these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law provisions could discourage or prevent third parties from seeking to obtain control of us  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might receive a premium for their shares over prevailing market prices 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the carrying values of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable and accounts payable  approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
we have historically had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
therefore we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk 
while the united kingdom now contributes significantly to our revenues  we continue to believe our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risk is low 
as we continue to expand globally  the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may increase 
therefore  in the future  we may consider utilizing derivative instruments to mitigate such risks
