the product has been tested and certified for lab trials by of these service providers and oem labs as of june  during fiscal  we discontinued our golong product  which was to double the distance that asymmetric digital subscriber line  or adsl  can be delivered over copper telephone lines 
market acceptance of golong proved elusive and we no longer offer the product for sale 
our global services division provides a wide portfolio of professional services and support products for sync  timing and broadband access customers 
in july  the global services quality program was audited by stat a matrix  a member of the sam group  an international quality firm  and was certified compliant to telcordia gr core 
this enabled us to obtain approval to perform installations at regional bell operating company customers 
in january  the division introduced new customer relationship management  or crm  software enabling a global view of customer service requests  contracts and dispatch scheduling for on site support services 
in march  we launched our first international spare parts warehouse 
the warehouse is based in the united kingdom and services customers in european union member countries 
this new program was created in response to the growing demand for spare parts support in europe 
during fiscal  global services was selected by several us carriers to handle sync and timing installations for their international network build outs 
our customers include worldwide public network providers  incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  post telephone and telegraph companies  or ptts  competitive local exchange carriers  or clecs  other telephone companies  wireless service providers  cable television operators  internet service providers  or isps  and original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
symmetricom was incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in we have six reportable business segments synchronization products  wireless products  broadband access products  transmission products  contract manufacturing  and global services 
information as to net sales and gross profit margin attributable to each of our six segments for each year in the three year period ended june   is contained in note j of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
industry background the past months has been a time of great challenge and change in the telecommunications industry 
telecommunications carriers and service providers are faced with rapidly changing business models  high customer turnover  an evolving technological landscape  increasing service demands and the potential for accelerated change in the regulatory environment 
efficient transmission of high quality voice  data  or video over the network  whether copper  fiber or wireless  is now critical to meet business needs for increased bandwidth 
telecommunications companies are confronted with the task of maximizing the value of the existing copper wire infrastructure  their single biggest network asset  in order to deliver business class broadband services 
the telecommunications industry is currently comprised of several different markets  including wireline infrastructure  wireless and broadband 
wireline infrastructure market the wireline infrastructure market includes local  long distance  and international telecommunications service providers 
customers in this market include worldwide public network providers  ilecs  ptts  clecs  and other telephone companies 
demand from this sector has substantially declined as network service providers have decreased capital spending 
government deregulation uncertainties also slowed deployments in the united states 
however  some sectors continue to grow  including the broadband and circuit to packet convergence areas 
we believe that the critical need for synchronization in all wireline networks and the need to maximize the efficiency of the networks will lead to renewed demand for our timing devices when this market begins to turnaround 
implementation rates of new generations of wireless technology by service providers may be slow in the current market 

table of contents wireless market wireless telecommunications networks consist of numerous cells located throughout a service area  each with its own base station connected to the wireline network through a network switch 
in a wireless network  calls are segmented  transmitted over a wider spectrum of bandwidth  and reassembled by a receiver within the network 
without proper synchronization  signal degradation resulting from this process of segmentation and reassembly may result in dropped calls and loss of data  thereby decreasing network efficiency and capacity 
in order to minimize the problems that result from poor synchronization  cellular operators and cellular base station manufacturers require precise timing equipment 
as g and g data applications over wireless networks become increasingly prevalent  precise timing devices will be essential for acceptable performance 
broadband access market we believe that the ilecs largest and most valuable assets are their last mile copper loops 
unlike wireless  optical and cable  the copper loop extends to every business in the united states  and almost every business internationally 
under government regulations  these copper loops are available to all service providers 
the demand for bandwidth from businesses continues to grow steadily while the options available for accessing the bandwidth remain limited 
the current options  either t e access at speeds of mbps or t e fiber access at mbps  leave businesses facing the broadband gap  or the void where high speed capacity is unavailable  too expensive  or unable to meet the bandwidth need 
telecommunications providers are  accordingly  searching for economical methods to deliver voice and data at greater speeds using copper 
g 
shdsl  an internationally approved next generation standard that delivers higher bandwidth over greater distances  offers an alternate methodology to utilize copper loops for broadband services delivery 
products we address the needs of the world s telecommunications service providers by providing innovative synchronization  timing  frequency  access and broadband products  as well as professional services 
our synchronization and timing products optimize bandwidth utilization and deliver a high quality transmission of voice  data and video over most networks 
networks increasingly are required to transmit large volumes of data and video for the purpose of communicating information  conducting business  and delivering entertainment 
in order to transfer voice  data or video traffic from one line or network to another  both segments of the network must operate at the same frequency within a very narrow tolerance 
the failure to synchronize digital network equipment results in the loss of information  requiring re transmission and thus decreasing network efficiency and increasing network operating costs 
the following discussion includes products from each of our six segments synchronization products  wireless products  broadband access products  transmission products  contract manufacturing and global services 
synchronization products the public switched telecommunications network  or pstn  consists of a series of interconnected switching equipment and other components  or nodes  that route voice  video and data traffic throughout the network 
for these networks to function efficiently it is essential that each network be synchronized and individual nodes within the network operate within very precise tolerances 
precision synchronization equipment throughout these networks provides a frequency reference to enable digital switching and transmission systems to operate at a common  or synchronized  clock rate  therefore minimizing signal degradation and reducing errors in the transmission of data throughout a network 
synchronization products comprised of our consolidated revenue in fiscal  of consolidated revenue in fiscal and in fiscal high quality synchronization is an essential requirement for modern telecommunications service providers as they move to high capacity  high speed digital transmission technologies such as dense wavelength division multiplexing  synchronous optical network  or sonet  and synchronous digital hierarchy  or sdh  networks

we also prepaid million for product royalty obligations on future sales 
the purchase price of the transaction consisted of  warrants for symmetricom common stock with a fair value of million  cash payments of million and acquisition costs of million 
the fair value of the warrants issued was calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets based on their fair values at the time of the acquisition million was allocated to purchased technology and million to equipment and inventory 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
symmetricom considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for warranty  inventory valuation  capitalized acquisition costs  accounting for income taxes  valuation of investments and valuation of intangible assets and goodwill to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our standard arrangement for the majority of our domestic and international customers includes a signed purchase order  in which we offer payment terms of days  and no right of return of delivered products 
we assess collectibility based on the credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we recognize the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
we commonly have transactions that involve sales of both product and services to our customers 
product revenue is generated from the sale of synchronization and timing equipment with embedded software that is essential to 
table of contents product functionality 
we account for these transactions in accordance with the rules applicable to software revenue recognition 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed provided collection of the related receivable is probable 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances 
accordingly  we defer a percentage of revenue to distributors based on an historical average of distributor returns 
we record commissions expense when orders are booked  at which time the commission is both earned and payable 
warranty reserve the standard warranty on our products ranges from one to five years in length 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
our warranty reserve is based on a historical analysis of the volume of product returned to symmetricom under the warranty program and the associated repair costs 
we use the historical data to forecast our anticipated future warranty obligations 
this analysis is updated on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  we record a specific allowance based on the amount that we believe will be collected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  we will record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a monthly basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand  and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
during fiscal  we charged million to cost of goods sold in order to write down excess and obsolete inventory 
capitalized acquisition costs as of june   we had capitalized approximately million and million in acquisition related costs for datum and truetime  respectively 
if we fail to complete these transactions  the capitalized costs will be expensed during fiscal accounting for income taxes the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations outside the united states  primarily in puerto rico 
net earnings of our puerto rico subsidiary are taxed under internal revenue code section  which exempts qualified puerto rico earnings from federal income tax 
section limits the amount of qualified puerto rico earnings and expires in fiscal year the change in tax law may affect our future tax rate 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which is made up primarily of tax deductions and net operating loss carryforwards  assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these deductions 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not 
table of contents that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
all of our tax credits  which are related to stock options  have valuation allowances because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
if these tax credits are realized  the benefit will be credited to common stock 
valuation of investments our investments in publicly held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value  and such a decline is not considered temporary 
during fiscal  we concluded that the decline in value of our investment in the common stock of parthus technologies plc parthus had become other than temporary 
accordingly  million was written off as an impairment loss on investments  based on the quoted fair value of parthus common stock on the date the impairment loss was recorded 
our investment in parthus may become further impaired in fiscal  particularly in view of the difficulties many technology companies have had in the current economic climate 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets include goodwill  purchased technology  trademarks  and other 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value  and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge is recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the fiscal year 
no impairment losses were recorded during fiscal based on these evaluations 
further decline in the telecommunications industry could precipitate a write down of intangible assets and goodwill 
results of operations the following table presents the percentage of total revenue for the respective line items in  symmetricom inc s consolidated statement of operations 
year ended june  net sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative operating income loss gain on sale of equity investments interest income interest expense gain from discontinued operations  net of tax net earnings loss 
table of contents fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales consist primarily of product and services sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales in fiscal included million in net sales from our sync products segment  million from our wireless products segment and million from our contract manufacturing segment 
the decrease in net sales was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures by our major customers during fiscal  a weakening demand for telecommunications equipment and a general downturn in the telecommunications industry 
net sales in our sync products segment decreased in fiscal from fiscal net sales of wireless products decreased in fiscal from fiscal net sales in our contract manufacturing segment decreased in fiscal from fiscal and net sales in our global services decreased in fiscal from fiscal we anticipate that  on a comparative basis  our net sales will continue to remain at low levels until the telecommunications market begins to recover and our customers resume capital spending at more robust levels 
gross profit gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a combination of lower sales and manufacturing levels  resulting in relatively higher overhead costs allocated to cost of goods sold 
during fiscal  our gross profit was also impacted by a million non recurring charge to cost of goods sold for severance costs incurred in connection with the termination of employees within our manufacturing department 
operating expense research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  prototype expenses  and fees paid to outside consultants 
research and development expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the dollar decrease in research and development expenses is primarily due to a reduction in discretionary expenditures throughout symmetricom and management s decision to provide a more concentrated focus on specific research and development projects 
we expect to continue to support research and development efforts in order to enhance existing products and design and develop new technologies and products 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  sales commissions and travel related expenses for our sales and services  finance  human resources  information technology and facilities departments 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in headcount across all departments as well as a reduction in discretionary expenditures 
in fiscal  we had a total of employees in our selling  general and administrative departments  compared to employees in fiscal amortization of goodwill and intangibles the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets relates to certain assets and products that were acquired from the hewlett packard company s communications synchronization business and telmax communications corporation 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily because we ceased amortizing goodwill during fiscal during fiscal  
table of contents symmetricom adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this accounting standard requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be separately disclosed from other intangible assets in the statement of operations  and no longer be amortized but tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
in accordance with sfas no 
 during fiscal we discontinued amortizing million in goodwill 
see also recent accounting pronouncements below 
non recurring loss gain during fiscal  we recorded a non recurring operating expense of million for costs related to a reduction in workforce and a million charge to cost of goods sold for expenses related to the termination of certain manufacturing employees 
the charges were primarily comprised of severance costs for terminated employees 
all expenses related to the termination of the employees were paid out during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a non recurring gain of million 
this gain was the result of a million gain in connection with the sale of our antenna business  offset by a charge related to severance costs incurred for a reduction in workforce during fiscal gain on sale of equity investments during fiscal  we recorded a non recurring gain of million from the sale of our investment in brocade  inc common stock 
during fiscal  we also concluded that the decline in value of our investment in the common stock of parthus technologies plc parthus had become other than temporary 
to determine that the decline in the value of our investment was other than temporary  we considered both the duration of the decline and the extent to which the market value of parthus common stock was below our recorded cost basis in the common stock 
market value is determined based on the share prices as quoted on the nasdaq national market 
accordingly  million was written off as an impairment loss on investments 
our remaining investment in parthus may become further impaired in fiscal  particularly in view of the difficulties many technology companies have had in the current economic climate 
during fiscal  we recorded a non recurring gain on the sale of equity investments of million 
the gain was comprised of a million gain from the sale of stock in parthus and a million gain from the sale of stock of brocade  inc interest income interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our short term investments as well as lower average interest rates during fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense interest expense consists primarily of interest on our capital lease for our headquarters building in san jose  california 
interest expense remained constant at million in both fiscal and we do not expect a significant change in interest expense during fiscal income tax provision benefit our income tax benefit was million effective tax rate of in fiscal compared to an income tax provision of million effective tax rate of in fiscal the effective tax rate has fluctuated as a result of the impact of nonrecurring gains and losses  the acquisition and disposition of business lines and changes in the valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate is also affected by the percentage of qualified puerto rico earnings compared to total earnings as most of our puerto rico earnings are taxed under section of the us internal revenue code  which exempts qualified puerto rico earnings from federal income taxes 
this exemption is subject to wage based limitations and expires at the end of fiscal in addition  this exemption will be subject to an additional limitation related to a prior year s earnings in fiscal through fiscal 
table of contents certain deferred tax assets are subject to a valuation allowance  attributable to stock option transactions 
when these stock option related deferred tax assets are realized  the benefit will be credited to common stock 
gain from discontinued operations  net of tax during fiscal  we recognized a million gain  or per share  net of taxes  for the release of funds from an escrow account established in connection with the sale during fiscal of our linfinity microelectronics  inc linfinity semiconductor subsidiary 
under the terms of the agreement  a portion of the total consideration was to be held in escrow until certain conditions of the agreement were satisfied 
the linfinity business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation  and  accordingly  its results of operations have been excluded from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for all periods presented 
during fiscal  we recognized a million gain  or per share  net of taxes  for discontinued operations related to linfinity 
net earnings loss as a result of the factors above  we incurred a net loss of million or per share in fiscal compared to net earnings of million or per share diluted in fiscal fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales increased  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this million increase in net sales in fiscal is primarily comprised of an increase in the sales of our wireless and synchronization products which includes the following million from existing customers who were expanding their operations and million from all other sources 
net sales of wireless products increased to million  in fiscal from million in fiscal  while net sales of synchronization products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit gross profit margin increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal in fiscal  the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower material costs resulting from favorable prices on higher volume component purchases as well as a favorable mix due to increased sales of higher margin products  such as our ste clocks and our timesource  and products 
operating expenses research and development expense decreased by to million in fiscal when compared to million in fiscal the decrease in research and development expense during fiscal is due to a reduction in employee headcount in research and development  management s decision to provide a more concentrated focus on specific research and development projects  and the sale of the gps division in the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal we had planned to increase our research and development efforts in our broadband access division  which includes our golong and gowide products 
selling  general and administrative expense  including amortization of goodwill and intangibles  increased by million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in the aggregate dollars expensed during fiscal is the result of an increase in selling expenses  which is consistent with the increase in sales volume for the fiscal year 
also  during fiscal we opened a new sales office in hong kong and hired additional employees in order to meet increased product demand

certain deferred tax assets remain subject to a valuation allowance that was substantially reduced in fiscal the remaining valuation allowance is attributable to stock option transactions and will be credited to common stock when the related deferred assets are realized 
in recent years  the effective tax rate has fluctuated as a result of the impact of nonrecurring gains and losses  the acquisition and disposition of business lines and changes to the valuation allowance 
gain from discontinued operations during our fiscal year ended june   we recognized a gain of million or per share diluted  net of taxes  on the sale of discontinued operations related to the linfinity business 
the gain represents an adjustment to the estimate for selling related expenses incurred during the disposition of the business 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net earnings were million or per share diluted in fiscal compared to million or per share diluted in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of june   working capital was million compared to million as of june  and million as of june  cash and cash equivalents as of june  increased million to million from million as of june  this increase was primarily the result of maturities of short term investments of million  million cash provided by operations  million in cash related to the release of an escrow for discontinued operations and million from the proceeds from the sale of equity investments

we base our expense levels in part on our expectation of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient  to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we require additional capital resources to grow our business or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses in the future  we may seek to sell additional private or public equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources

factors that may affect results our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future  which could cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to our investors we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of its future performance 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the continuation of recent adverse economic conditions  particularly within the telecommunications equipment industry  which may result in further revenue shortfalls  the effects of terrorist activity and armed conflict which may disrupt general economic activity and result in revenue shortfalls  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components at commercially reasonable prices  changes in our products or mix of sales to customers  our ability to manage fluctuations in manufacturing yields  our ability to manage the level and value of its inventories  our ability to accurately anticipate the volume and timing of customer orders or customer cancellations  the gain or loss of significant customers  our ability to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis  customer delays in qualification of new products  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products and our competitors products  our ability to manage increased competition and competitive pricing pressures  our ability to manage fluctuations  especially declines  in the average selling prices of our products  our ability to manage the long sales cycle associated with our products  our ability to manage cyclical conditions in the telecommunications industry  and reduced rates of growth of telecommunications services and high bandwidth applications 
a significant portion of our operating and manufacturing expenses are relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders 
if we are unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected future sales shortfall  our operating results will be negatively impacted 
our operations entail a high level of fixed costs and require an adequate volume of production and sales to achieve and maintain reasonable gross profit margins and net earnings 
significant decreases in demand for our products or reduction in our average selling prices  or any material delay in customer orders may negatively harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future results depend in large part on growth in the markets for our products 
the growth in each of these markets may depend on changes in general economic conditions  conditions related to the markets in which we compete  changes in regulatory conditions  legislation  export rules or conditions  interest rates and fluctuations in the business cycle for any particular market segment 
if our quarterly or annual operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 

table of contents we experienced net operating losses in the past and may experience net operating losses again in the future we had a net loss of million for the fiscal year ending june  we can not assure you that we will regularly be able to achieve operating profitability 
if we are unable to achieve operating profitability or if we incur future losses and negative cash flow  our stock price will likely decline 
if we continue to incur net operating losses  a valuation allowance may be necessary for some or all of our deferred tax assets  which would harm our operating results if we continue to sustain operating losses  we may be unable to utilize our deferred tax assets 
in addition  our ability to realize a tax benefit with regard to future losses may be limited which may require an additional valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance would increase future tax expenses and be harmful to our future operating results 
the economic downturn in the telecommunications industry has negatively impacted the demand for our products and may impair our customers ability to pay us the telecommunications industry  from which we derive most of our revenue  is experiencing a general economic downturn 
we do not know when or if the telecommunications markets will recover 
this downturn has negatively affected many of our customers and has significantly weakened the financial condition of others 
some customers have filed for bankruptcy protection and others may do so as well 
a customer s seeking bankruptcy protection can result in our not receiving payment for products delivered  the cancellation of one or more contracts and the loss of a customer 
in addition  the continued decline of demand in the telecommunications industry could delay decisions by some of our customers to renew their agreements or relationships with us or could delay decisions by prospective customers to make initial evaluations of our products 
reductions or delays in expenditures for our products  nonpayment for products delivered and the cancellation of contracts and the loss of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have entered into a merger agreement with datum we have entered into a merger agreement with datum  pursuant to which datum would become our wholly owned subsidiary 
under that merger agreement  and subject to its terms and conditions  each share of datum common stock outstanding will be exchanged for shares of symmetricom common stock subject to adjustments to reflect the effect of any stock split  stock dividend  reorganization or similar change in symmetricom or datum common stock  and subject to possible downward adjustment in association with transaction costs 
the merger with datum is subject to a number of conditions  and there can be no assurance that it will occur or  if it does  of what effect it will have on the stock price  results of operations or financial condition of symmetricom or the combined company 
we expect to complete our merger with truetime before we complete the datum merger 
if we fail to complete the datum merger our stock price could decline 
we have entered into a merger agreement with truetime we have entered into a merger with truetime pursuant to which we would pay an estimated million in cash and issue approximately million shares of symmetricom common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of truetime  and truetime would become our wholly owned subsidiary 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the truetime merger agreement  each share of truetime common stock outstanding will be exchanged for 
of a share of symmetricom common stock and an amount in cash anticipated to be subject to adjustments to reflect the effect of any stock split  stock dividend  reorganization or similar change in symmetricom or truetime common stock  and the cash amount per share is subject to possible downward adjustment depending on truetime s merger transaction costs 
the merger with truetime is subject to a number of conditions  and we cannot assure you that it will occur or  if it does  of what effect it will have on 
table of contents the stock price  results of operations or financial condition of symmetricom or the combined company 
we expect to complete our merger with truetime before we complete the datum merger 
if we fail to complete the truetime merger our stock price could decline 
we purchase certain key components of our synchronization and timing equipment from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these sources fail to fulfill our needs although we primarily use standard products which are generally available from multiple sources  we have limited suppliers for our rubidium and quartz oscillators  which are key components of our synchronization and timing equipment 
the inability to obtain sufficient key components could result in untimely product shipments and lost sales which could harm our business and operating results 
we have relied and continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales  and our revenue could decline due to the delay of customer orders or cancellation of existing orders a relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales 
two customers  verizon and acterna worldwide  each accounted for of our net sales during fiscal in fiscal  acterna worldwide and samsung accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales 
we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
the timing and level of sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
for example  our sales to verizon were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal sales to samsung were million is fiscal  compared million in fiscal sales to acterna were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal we cannot be sure as to the timing or level of future sales to our customers 
the loss of one or more of our significant customers  or a significant reduction or delay in sales to any customer  may harm our business and operating results 
if we are unable to develop new products  or we are delayed in production startup  sales of our products could decline  which could reduce our revenue the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements  and frequent new product introductions 
technological advancements could render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
our success will depend on our ability to respond to changing technologies and customer requirements and our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products  in a cost effective and timely manner 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development  introduction or marketing of our new products and enhancements 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we manage a smooth transition from older products to new products 
in the future  we expect to attempt to develop certain new products that we may not successfully develop 
delays in new product development or delays in production startup could reduce sales of our products  which would negatively impact our revenue 

table of contents our products are complex and may contain errors or design flaws which could be costly to correct our products are complex and often use state of the art components  processes and techniques 
when we release new products  or new versions of existing products  they may contain undetected or unresolved errors or defects 
despite testing  errors or defects may be found in new products or upgrades after the commencement of commercial shipments 
undetected errors and design flaws have occurred in the past and could occur in the future 
these errors could result in delays  loss of market acceptance and sales  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  legal action by our customers  failure to attract new customers  and increased service and warranty costs 
the occurrence of any of these factors could cause our net sales to decline 
the telecommunications market is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete successfully in our markets  our revenue could decline competition in the telecommunications industry in general  and in the markets we serve  is intense and likely to increase substantially 
we face competition in all of our markets 
competitors in our synchronization products segment include datum  inc  frequency electronics  inc  larus  inc  and oscilloquartz sa 
competitors in our wireless segment include trimble navigation  ltd 
and datum  inc  and our primary competitor in our broadband access segment is adtran  inc in addition  the telecommunications act of permits ilecs to manufacture telecommunications equipment  which may result in increased competition 
our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend on many factors including the cost effectiveness  quality  price  service and market acceptance of our products  our response to the entry of new competitors into our markets or the introduction of new products by our competitors  the average selling prices received for our products  our ability to keep pace with changing technology and customer requirements  our continued improvement of existing products  the timely development or acquisition of new or enhanced products  the timing of new product introductions by our competitors or us  and changes in worldwide market and economic conditions 
many of our competitors or potential competitors are more established than we are and have greater financial  manufacturing  technical and marketing resources 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products  or to deliver competitive products at lower prices 
we expect to continue to experience pricing pressures from our competitors in all of its markets and continued price erosion in several of our product lines 
if we are unable to compete by delivering new products or by delivering competitive products at lower prices  we could lose market share and our revenue could decline 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our competitive position could be weakened and our revenues may decline we believe our success will depend in a large part on our ability to protect trade secrets  obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the rights of others 
we rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and patent registration  contractual restrictions and internal security to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
these measures may not provide sufficient protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
we have united states and international patents and patent applications pending that cover certain technology used by our operations 
however  while we believe that our patents have value  we rely primarily on innovation  technological expertise and marketing competence to maintain our competitive position 
while we intend to continue our efforts to obtain patents whenever possible  there can be no assurance that patents will be 
table of contents issued  or that new  or existing patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted will provide us with any commercial benefit 
third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims which would be difficult to defend  costly and may result in our loss of significant rights the telecommunications industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
we are subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
although we are currently not a party to any intellectual property litigation  from time to time we have received claims asserting that we have infringed the proprietary rights of others 
we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future  or that any such claims will not result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license for such intellectual property rights regardless of the merit of such claims 
no assurance can be given that any necessary licenses will be available or that  if available  such licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
if we acquire other companies and are unable to smoothly integrate the businesses we acquire  our operations and financial results could be harmed as part of our business strategy we have engaged in acquisitions in the past  recently announced the proposed acquisitions of truetime and datum  and continue to evaluate other acquisition opportunities that could provide additional product or service offerings  technologies or additional industry expertise 
our pending acquisitions of datum and truetime  and our future acquisitions  involve risks which include the following we may be exposed to unknown liabilities of the acquired business  we may incur significant one time write offs  we may experience problems in combining the acquired operations  technologies or products  we may overestimate the revenue and profits that we expect the acquired businesses to generate  we may overestimate the cost savings to be obtained from combining the acquired operations with ours  we may experience regulatory difficulties and unbudgeted expenses in attempting to complete an acquisition  we may encounter unanticipated acquisition or integration costs that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate  our management s attention may be diverted from our core business  our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers may be impaired  we may encounter difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  we may be unable to retain key employees of the purchased organizations  our stockholders may be diluted if we pay for the acquisition with equity securities  and we have capitalized certain direct costs related to our proposed business combinations with truetime and datum  if we fail to complete either of these transactions  the capitalized direct costs will be expensed during fiscal we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any business  products  technologies or personnel from any pending  recent or future acquisitions 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions or to achieve any anticipated benefits of an acquisition  our operations and business could be harmed 
additionally  we may experience difficulty integrating and managing the acquired business operations 
for these reasons  we cannot be certain what effect pending or future acquisitions may have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to environmental regulations that could result in costly environmental liability that could exceed our resources our operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
while we have not experienced any significant effects on our operations from environmental regulations  changes in these regulations may require additional capital expenditures or restrict our ability to expand our operations 
failure to comply with such regulations could result in suspension or cessation of our operations or could subject us to significant liabilities 
although we periodically review our facilities and internal operations for compliance with applicable environmental regulations  these reviews are necessarily limited in scope and frequency and may not reveal all potential instances of noncompliance  possible injury or possible contamination 
the liabilities arising from any noncompliance with environmental regulations  or liability resulting from accidental contamination or injury from toxic or hazardous chemicals could result in liability that exceeds our resources 
the risk of liabilities increases as we acquire other companies  such as datum  which use  or have used  hazardous substances at various current or former facilities 
our customers may be subject to governmental regulations  which  if changed  could negatively impact our business results federal and state regulatory agencies  including the federal communications commission and the various state public utility commissions and public service commissions  regulate most of our domestic telecommunications customers 
similar government oversight also exists in the international market 
while we are not directly affected by this legislation  such regulation of our customers may negatively impact our business 
for instance  the sale of our products may be affected by the imposition upon certain of our customers of common carrier tariffs and the taxation of telecommunications services 
these regulations are continuously reviewed and changed by the various governmental agencies 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the united states or elsewhere  could negatively impact our business results 
sales of a significant portion of our products to customers outside of the united states subjects us to business  economic and political risks our export sales  which are primarily to western europe  latin america  the far east and canada  accounted for of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales of fiscal and of net sales of fiscal we anticipate that sales to customers located outside of the united states will continue to be a significant part of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
because significant portions of our sales are to customers outside of the united states we are subject to risks  including foreign currency fluctuations  export restrictions  longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or tariffs  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition  dependence on local vendors  and reduced or limited protection of intellectual property rights and political and economic instability 
to date  very few of our international revenue and cost obligations have been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive  and thus  less competitive in foreign markets 
a portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  including the euro  which will subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in these foreign currencies 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities or derivative arrangements  but may do so in the future to the extent that such obligations become more significant 

table of contents if we have significant inventories that become obsolete or cannot be sold at acceptable prices  our results may be negatively impacted although we believe that we currently have made adequate adjustments for inventory that has declined in value  become obsolete  or is in excess of anticipated demand  there can be no assurance that such adjustments will be adequate 
if significant inventories of our products become obsolete  or are otherwise not able to be sold at favorable prices  our business could be materially affected 
increases in our effective tax rate will negatively impact our cash flow our effective tax rate is affected by the percentage of qualified puerto rican earnings compared to our total earnings 
most of our puerto rican earnings are taxed under section of the united states internal revenue code  which exempts qualified puerto rican earnings from federal taxes when calculating our effective tax rate 
historically  using this exemption has reduced our effective tax rate 
our overall effective tax rate could increase during fiscal years through  as the exemption will become subject to additional limitations before it expires at the end of fiscal any increase in our effective tax rate will increase our federal income taxes and negatively impact our cash flow 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure as of june   we had short term investments of million 
our investment portfolio as of june  consists of equity securities  which are classified as available for sale 
we also maintain investments in corporate debt securities 
as of june   our entire million investment in corporate debt securities was classified as cash equivalents  as the maturity dates of the securities were less than three months 
our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our corporate debt securities  which are subject to interest rate risk inasmuch as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing at june   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
additionally  a decrease in the market interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of the portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce these risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than nine months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
in addition  we believe that we currently have the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore  believe that reductions in the value of these securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially harm our business 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balance with our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
although we transact business with various countries  settlement amounts are usually based on united states currency 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past and we do not presently engage in hedging activity on sterling or other currencies 
based on the intercompany balance of million at june   a hypothetical adverse change in sterling against united states dollars would not result in a material foreign exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that reductions in the value of such intercompany balances or of other accounts denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our business 

table of contents notwithstanding the foregoing analysis of the direct effects of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  the indirect effects of such fluctuations could have a materially harmful effect on our business 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the united states  foreign and global economies which could materially harm our business
