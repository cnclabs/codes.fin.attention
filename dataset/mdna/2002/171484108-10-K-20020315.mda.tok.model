you should read this discussion together with the financial statements and other financial information included in the report 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
general information about our business we conduct pari mutuel wagering on live thoroughbred  quarter horse and standardbred horse racing and simulcast signals of races 
additionally  we offer racing services through our other interests 
we own and operate the churchill downs racetrack in louisville  kentucky  which has conducted thoroughbred racing since and is internationally known as the home of the kentucky derby 
we also own and operate hollywood park  a thoroughbred racing operation in inglewood  california  arlington park  a pari mutuel horse racing operation in arlington heights  illinois  calder race course  a thoroughbred racing operation in miami  florida  and ellis park  a thoroughbred racetrack in henderson  kentucky 
additionally  we are the majority owner and operator of hoosier park in anderson  indiana  which conducts thoroughbred  quarter horse and standardbred horse racing 
we conduct simulcast wagering on horse racing at nine simulcast wagering facilities in kentucky  indiana and illinois  as well as at our six racetracks 
because of the seasonal nature of our business and recent acquisitions and merger activity  revenues and operating results for any interim quarter are likely not indicative of the revenues and operating results for the year and are not necessarily comparable with results for the corresponding period of the previous year 
we normally earn a substantial portion of our net earnings in the second and third quarters of each year during which all our operations are open for some or all of this period and the kentucky derby and the kentucky oaks are run 
information regarding racing dates at our facilities for and is included in item e  licenses and live racing dates of this form k 
our revenues are generated from commissions on pari mutuel wagering at our racetracks and off track betting facilities  plus simulcast fees  indiana riverboat admissions subsidy revenue  admissions  concessions revenue  sponsorship revenues  licensing rights and broadcast fees  lease income and other sources 
in pari mutuel wagering  all wagers are placed in a common pool 
the pari mutuel operator retains as revenue a pre determined percentage of the total amount wagered  and the balance is distributed to the winning patrons 
the percentages retained on live racing at our various locations range from to 
in general  the commissions earned from simulcasting are contractually determined and range from to 
all commissions earned from pari mutuel wagering are shared with horsemen based on local contracts and average approximately 
to compensate for the adverse impact of riverboat competition  the horse industry in indiana presently receives per admission to riverboats in the state 
during  the indiana horse racing commission ihrc required of any revenue received from the subsidy to be used for purse expenses  breed development and reimbursement of approved marketing costs 
the balance  with a ceiling of million  was received by hoosier park 
at the start of  the ihrc lifted the million ceiling and now requires an allocation of of any subsidy revenue to purse expenses and breed development 
the remaining will be split evenly between operating racetracks in indiana  as long as the racetracks have at least days of approved standardbred and thoroughbred live racing during the year 
in  the ihrc approved an application for a second racetrack  scheduled to open in december of to the extent that the second racetrack runs both breeds and the required minimum number of days in  hoosier park s share of the subsidy would be reduced 
under this scenario  it is likely hoosier park would re evaluate the racing schedule for the future 
legislation allowing pari mutuel pull tabs at approved racetracks and two marion county otbs which also eliminates the requirement that riverboat casinos cruise while gaming is conducted failed to move out of conference committee on the final day of the regular session of the indiana general assembly 
however  the legislation could be introduced again later this year if lawmakers meet in a special session to deal with the state s budget deficit 
while this legislation would help hoosier park in competing with increased riverboat competition  it could have an adverse impact on our kentucky operations if passed 
in kentucky  two pieces of legislation significant to our operations were passed in the session of the kentucky general assembly 
first  an excise tax credit for racetracks was included in the kentucky state budget 
the measure results in an ultimate credit of nearly million in new revenue  of which million was received in  and is earmarked for horsemen s incentives and necessary capital improvements at churchill downs over the next year 
we are seeking to preserve the excise tax credit in the kentucky state budget 
the kentucky general assembly also enacted legislation that eliminates the excise tax on breeders cup championship day wagering at any kentucky track that hosts the event 
this legislation is aimed at attracting the breeders cup to kentucky  and churchill downs  on a more frequent basis 
on track wagering for the breeders cup day at churchill downs totaled million and generated excise taxes of approximately  this tax exemption went into effect on january   and therefore did not apply to the breeders cup at churchill downs 
the exemption will continue if the breeders cup returns to kentucky within three years of the previously held event 
our business can be impacted positively and negatively by such legislative changes and competition 
significant negative changes resulting from these activities could result in a significant impairment of our property and equipment and or our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with generallly accepted accounting standards described above 
for the insurance renewal effective march   we assumed more risk than in the prior year  as a result of higher retentions  higher maximum losses for stop loss insurance  etc  for certain coverage 
in addition  property coverage for acts of terrorism has been limited 
based on our historical loss experience  management does not anticipate that this increased risk assumption will materially impact our results of operations 
additional information regarding how our facilities could be impacted by competition and legislative changes are included in item f and g  respectively  in this form k

while testing is not yet complete  management does not expect any loss as a result of the impairment tests 
the impact of the adoption of fas on the company s results of operations for all periods beginning on or after january  will be to eliminate amortization of goodwill 
management of the company estimates a reduction of million in amortization expense for related to the adoption of fas in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes statement of financial accounting standards no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our revolving loan facility  which bears interest at libor based variable rates 
we are exposed to market risk on variable rate debt due to potential adverse changes in the libor rate 
assuming the outstanding balance on the revolving loan facility remains constant  a one percentage point increase in the libor rate would reduce annual pre tax earnings  recorded fair value and cash flows by million 
in order to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with our variable rate debt  we have entered into interest rate swap contracts with major financial institutions 
under terms of these separate contracts we receive a libor based variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate of and on notional amounts of million each which mature in march and may  respectively 
we have also entered into a contract in which we pay a fixed interest rate of on a notional amount of million which matures in november assuming the december   notional amounts under the interest rate swap contracts remain constant  a one percentage point increase in the libor rate would increase annual pre tax earnings  recorded fair value and cash flows by million
