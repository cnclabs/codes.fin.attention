item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
kodak recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
for the sale of multiple element arrangements whereby equipment is combined with services  including maintenance and training  and other elements  including software and products  the company allocates to and recognizes revenue from the various elements based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value if software is incidental to the transaction or kodak specific objective evidence of fair value if software is other than incidental to the sales transaction as a whole 
revisions to these determinants of fair value would affect the timing of revenue allocated to the various elements in the arrangement and would impact the results of operations of the company 
for full service solutions sales  which consist of the sale of equipment and software which may or may not require significant production  modification or customization  there are two acceptable methods of accounting percentage of completion accounting and completed contract accounting 
for certain of the company s full service solutions  the completed contract method of accounting is being followed by the company 
this is due to the company s lack of historical experience resulting in the inability to provide reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to the various stages of such contracts as would be necessary under the percentage of completion methodology 
furthermore  the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts  price protection  promotional and advertising allowances and volume discounts 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to expand these customer offerings which may result in incremental reductions to revenue 
kodak assesses the carrying value of its identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in the event that the carrying value of assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the company would record an adjustment to the respective carrying value 
kodak maintains provisions for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
kodak provides estimated inventory allowances for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these reserves are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
kodak holds minority interests in certain publicly traded and privately held companies having operations or technology within its strategic area of focus 
the company s policy is to record an impairment charge on these investments when they experience declines in value which are considered to be other than temporary 
poor operating results of the investees or adverse changes in market conditions in the future may cause losses or an inability of the company to recover its carrying value in these underlying investments 
kodak evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
in the determination of the valuation allowance  the company has considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
should the company determine that it is more likely than not that it will realize certain of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance and increase income 
on the contrary  if the company determined that it would not be able to realize its recorded net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to the results of operations in the period such conclusion was made 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although management believes that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the results of operations of the company 
management estimates expected product failure rates  material usage and service costs in the development of its warranty obligations 
in the event that the actual results of these items differ from the estimates  an adjustment to the warranty obligation would be recorded 
pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the estimated market related value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  discount rates and other assumptions inherent in these valuations 
the company annually reviews the assumptions underlying the actuarial calculations and makes changes to these assumptions  based on current market conditions  as necessary 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension income expense ultimately recognized 
the other postretirement benefits liability is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in healthcare costs 
changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs will affect the recorded amount of other postretirement benefits expense 
environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures 
the liabilities include accruals for sites owned by kodak  sites formerly owned by kodak  and other third party sites where kodak was designated as a potentially responsible party prp 
the amounts accrued for such sites are based on these estimates  which may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of remediation 
to the extent that the current work plans are not effective in achieving targeted results  the proposals to regulatory agencies for desired methods and outcomes of remediation are not acceptable  or additional exposures are identified  kodak s estimate of its environmental liabilities may change

the company will continue to take actions to minimize the financial impact of this slowdown

the company will also complete the implementation of the restructuring programs announced in to make its operations more cost competitive and improve margins  particularly in its health imaging and consumer digital camera businesses 
during  the company completed an ongoing program of real estate divestitures and portfolio rationalization that contributed to other income charges reaching an annual average of million over the past three years

the euro the treaty on european union provided that an economic and monetary union emu be established in europe whereby a single european currency  the euro  replaces the currencies of participating member states 
the euro was introduced on january   at which time the value of participating member state currencies was irrevocably fixed against the euro and the european currency unit ecu was replaced at the rate of one euro to one ecu 
for the three year transitional period ending december   the national currencies of member states continued to circulate  but as sub units of the euro 
new public debt was issued in euros and existing debt was redenominated into euros 
at the end of the transitional period  euro banknotes and coins were issued  and the national currencies of the member states will cease to be legal tender no later than june  the countries that adopted the euro on january  were austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal  and spain 
greece was part of the transition 
the company has operations in all of these countries 
as a result of the euro conversion  it is possible that selling prices of the company s products and services will experience downward pressure  as current price variations among countries are reduced due to easy comparability of euro prices across countries 
prices will tend to harmonize  although value added taxes and transportation costs will still justify price differentials 
adoption of the euro will probably accelerate existing market and pricing trends including pan european buying and general price erosion 
on the other hand  currency exchange and hedging costs will be reduced  lower prices and pan european buying will benefit the company in its purchasing endeavors  the number of banks and suppliers needed will be reduced  there will be less variation in payment terms  and it will be easier for the company to expand into new marketing channels such as mail order and internet marketing 
the company made changes in areas such as marketing and pricing  purchasing  contracts  payroll  taxes  cash management and treasury operations 
under the no compulsion no prohibition rules  billing systems were modified so that the company is able to show total gross  value added tax  and net in euros on national currency invoices 
this enables customers to pay in the new euro currency if they wish to do so 
countries that have installed erp sap software in connection with the company s enterprise resource planning project are able to invoice and receive payments in euros as well as in other currencies 
systems for pricing  payroll and expense reimbursements continued to use national currencies until year end the functional currencies in the affected countries were the national currencies until may except germany and austria october  when they changed to the euro 
systems changes for countries not on sap finland and greece were implemented in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in was  million  as net earnings of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  and restructuring costs  asset impairments and other charges provided  million of operating cash 
also contributing to operating cash was a decrease in receivables of million and a decrease in inventories of million 
this was partially offset by decreases in liabilities  excluding borrowings  of million related primarily to severance payments for restructuring programs and reductions in accounts payable and accrued benefit costs 
net cash used in investing activities of  million in was utilized primarily for capital expenditures of million and business acquisitions of million 
net cash used in financing activities of million in was primarily the result of stock repurchases and dividend payments as discussed below 
the company declared cash dividends per share of 
in each of the first three quarters and 
in the fourth quarter of total cash dividends of million were paid in in october  the company s board of directors approved a change in dividend policy from quarterly dividend payments to semi annual dividend payments 
dividends  when declared  will be paid on the th business day of july and december to shareholders of record on the first business day of the preceding month 
these payment dates serve to better align the dividend disbursements with the seasonal cash flow pattern of the business  which is more concentrated in the second half of the year 
this action resulted in the company making five dividend payments in net working capital  excluding short term borrowings  decreased to million from  million at year end this decrease is mainly attributable to lower receivable and inventory balances  as discussed above 
capital additions  excluding equipment purchased for lease  were million in  with the majority of the spending supporting new products  manufacturing productivity and quality improvements  infrastructure improvements  ongoing environmental and safety initiatives  and renovations due to relocations associated with restructuring actions taken in in  the company expects to reduce its capital spending  excluding acquisitions and equipment purchased for lease  to a range of million to million 
capital additions by segment are included in note under the billion stock repurchase program announced on april   the company repurchased million of its shares in as of march   the company suspended the stock repurchase program in a move designed to accelerate debt reduction and increase financial flexibility 
at the time of the suspension of the program  the company had repurchased approximately billion of its shares under this program 
the company anticipates the net cash cost of the restructuring charge recorded in to be approximately million after tax  which will be recovered through cost savings in less than two years 
a majority of the severance related actions associated with this charge are expected to be completed in the early part of the company currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements  dividend payments and liquidity needs from cash generated from operations 
cash balances and financing arrangements will be used to bridge timing differences between expenditures and cash generated from operations 
the company has billion in revolving credit facilities established in  which are available to support the company s commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes 
the credit agreements are comprised of a day commitment at billion expiring in july and a year commitment at billion expiring in july if unused  they have a commitment fee of million per year  at the company s current credit rating 
interest on amounts borrowed under these facilities is calculated at rates based on spreads above certain reference rates and the company s credit rating 
at december   the company had billion in commercial paper outstanding  with a weighted average interest rate of 
in addition  the company had short term borrowings  excluding the current portion of long term debt  of million with a weighted average interest rate of during the second quarter of  the company increased its medium term note program from billion to billion for issuance of debt securities due nine months or more from date of issue 
at december   the company had debt securities outstanding of million under this medium term note program  with million of this balance due within one year 
the company has billion available under its medium term note program for the issuance of new notes 
total long term debt at december   including these amounts was as follows description and interest maturity dates rates of borrowings of borrowings notes debentures other during the fourth quarter of  the company s credit ratings were lowered by standard poor s and moody s to a and a for long term debt and a and p for short term debt  respectively 
these actions were due to lower earnings as a result of the economic slowdown  industry factors and other world events 
the lower credit ratings caused the company to experience slightly higher interest rates  although the relative cost of borrowing was very low on a comparative basis 
the company is in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in its credit agreements or indentures 
further  the company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its debt  with the exception of a million note due in that can be accelerated if the company s rating falls below bbb 
however  further downgrades in the company s credit rating or disruptions in the capital markets could adversely impact borrowing costs and the nature of its funding alternatives 
the company has access to billion in bank revolving credit facilities to meet unanticipated funding needs should it be necessary 
the company guarantees debt and other obligations under agreements with certain affiliated companies and customers 
at december   these guarantees totaled approximately million 
within the total amount of million  the company is guaranteeing debt in the amount of million for kodak polychrome graphics  an unconsolidated affiliate in which the company has a ownership interest 
the balance of the amount is principally comprised of other loan guarantees and guarantees of customer amounts due to banks in connection with various banks financing of customers purchase of equipment and products from kodak 
these guarantees would require payment from kodak only in the event of default on payment by the respective debtor 
management believes the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these guarantees 
in connection with the formation of the sk display corporation with sanyo electric co  ltd  the company will contribute approximately million  comprised of million in cash and million in loan guarantees during and qualex  a wholly owned subsidiary of kodak  has a ownership interest in express stop financing esf  which is a joint venture partnership between qualex and dana credit corporation dcc  a wholly owned subsidiary of dana corporation 
qualex accounts for its investment in esf under the equity method of accounting 
esf provides a long term financing solution to qualex s photofinishing customers in connection with qualex s leasing of photofinishing equipment to third parties  as opposed to qualex extending long term credit 
as part of the operations of its photofinishing business  qualex sells equipment under a sales type lease arrangement and records a long term receivable 
these long term receivables are subsequently sold to esf without recourse to qualex 
esf incurs long term debt to finance a portion of the purchase of the receivables from qualex 
this debt is collateralized solely by the long term receivables purchased from qualex and  in part  by a million guarantee from dcc 
qualex provides no guarantee or collateral to esf s creditors in connection with the debt  and esf s debt is non recourse to qualex 
qualex s only continued involvement in connection with the sale of the long term receivables is the servicing of the related equipment under the leases 
qualex has continued revenue streams in connection with this equipment through future sales of photofinishing consumables  including paper and chemicals  and maintenance 
qualex has risk with respect to the esf arrangement as it relates to its continued ability to procure spare parts from the primary photofinishing equipment vendor to fulfill its servicing obligations under the leases 
the primary photofinishing equipment vendor is currently experiencing financial difficulty  which raises concern about qualex s ability to procure the required service parts 
although the lessees requirement to pay esf under the lease agreements is not contingent upon qualex s fulfillment of its servicing obligations under the leases  under the agreement with esf  qualex would be responsible for any deficiency in the amount of rent not paid to esf as a result of any lessee s claim regarding maintenance or supply services not provided by qualex 
such lease payments would be made in accordance with the original lease terms  which generally extend over to years 
esf s outstanding lease receivable amount was approximately million at december  to mitigate the risk of not being able to fulfill its service obligations  qualex has built up its inventory of these spare parts and has begun refurbishing used parts 
additionally  qualex has entered into spare parts escrow agreements under which bills of materials  parts drawings  intellectual property and other information necessary to manufacture the parts were put into escrow arrangements 
in the event that the primary photofinishing equipment vendor were unable to supply the necessary parts to qualex  qualex would gain access to the information in the escrow arrangements to either manufacture or have manufactured the parts necessary to fulfill its servicing obligations 
management is currently negotiating alternatives with the photofinishing equipment vendor to further mitigate the above risks 
in december  standard poor s downgraded the credit ratings of dana corporation to bb for long term debt and b for short term debt  which are below investment grade 
this action created a guarantor termination event under the receivables purchase agreement rpa that esf has with its banks under the rpa 
to cure the guarantor termination event  in january  esf posted million of additional collateral in the form of cash and long term lease receivables 
at that time  if dana corporation were downgraded to below bb by standard poor s or below ba by moody s  that action would constitute a termination event under the rpa and esf would be forced to renegotiate its debt arrangements with the banks 
on february   moody s downgraded dana corporation to a ba credit rating  thus creating a termination event 
under the termination event  the banks can require esf to put up an additional collateral against the debt on a debt balance of approximately million at the time of filing the annual report  the additional collateral would be approximately million  the interest rate on the debt could be increased percentage points and qualex could be precluded from selling any new receivables to esf until the termination event has been waived by the banks 
esf does not currently have the ability to put up the additional collateral and  therefore  esf would require additional capital infusions by dcc and qualex 
if dcc and or qualex do not provide the additional capital funding to esf  the banks could accelerate the debt and force esf to liquidate its long term lease receivables to service the debt 
management believes that it is unlikely that the banks would accelerate the debt  and force esf to sell the receivables to a third party to generate cash to satisfy the debt  due to the high quality nature of the underlying long term receivable portfolio 
furthermore  under this scenario  the banks would not have any recourse against qualex  rather  the impact on qualex would be limited to the need to find an alternative source of financing for future photofinishing equipment placements 
additionally  under this scenario  it is not expected that the operations of the customers who are leasing the equipment under these long term lease arrangements would be affected such that qualex s revenue stream for future sales of photofinishing consumables would be jeopardized 
esf is beginning negotiations with the banks to resolve the termination event 
the current rpa arrangement expires on july   at which time the rpa can be extended or terminated 
if the rpa is terminated  qualex will no longer be able to sell its lease receivables to esf and will need to find an alternative financing solution for future sales of its photofinishing equipment 
under the partnership agreement between qualex and dcc  subject to certain conditions  esf has exclusivity rights to purchase qualex s long term lease receivables 
the term of the partnership agreement continues through october  in light of the termination event referred to above and the timing of the partnership termination  qualex is currently considering alternative financing solutions for prospective leasing activity with its customers 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and surety bonds in the amount of million to ensure the completion of environmental remediations and payment of possible casualty and workers compensation claims

other cash expenditures for pollution prevention and waste treatment for the company s current manufacturing facilities were as follows in millions recurring costs for pollution prevention and waste treatment capital expenditures for pollution prevention and waste treatment site remediation costs total at december  and  the company s undiscounted accrued liabilities for environmental remediation costs amounted to million and million  respectively 
these amounts are reported in other long term liabilities 
the company is currently implementing a corrective action program required by the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at the kodak park site in rochester  ny 
as part of this program  the company has completed the rcra facility assessment rfa  a broad based environmental investigation of the site 
the company is currently in the process of completing  and in some cases has completed  rcra facility investigations rfis and corrective measures studies cms for areas at the site 
at december   estimated future remediation costs of million are accrued on an undiscounted basis by the company and are included in the environmental accruals reported in other long term liabilities 
additionally  the company has retained certain obligations for environmental remediation and superfund matters related to certain sites associated with the non imaging health businesses sold in in addition  the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp in connection with the non imaging health businesses in five active superfund sites 
at december   estimated future remediation costs of million are accrued on an undiscounted basis by the company and are included in the environmental accruals reported in other long term liabilities 
the company recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter of for additional environmental reserves 
this amount has been included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
approximately million has been provided for two former manufacturing sites located outside the united states 
investigations were completed by an external environmental consultant in the fourth quarter of  which facilitated the completion of cost estimates for the future remediation and monitoring of these sites 
in addition  the accrual incorporates the company s estimate of its cost to repurchase one of the sites and demolish the buildings in preparation for its possible conversion to a public park 
the establishment of these accruals is consistent with kodak s policy to record accruals for environmental remediation obligations generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies 
the additional million recorded during the fourth quarter represents the estimated increased costs associated with the site remediation of the non imaging health businesses sold in discussed above million and increases in estimated costs million associated with the remediation of other facilities which are not material to the company s financial position  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position 
these aforementioned environmental accruals have been established on an undiscounted basis 
cash expenditures for the aforementioned remediation and monitoring activities are expected to be incurred over the next thirty years for each site 
the accrual reflects the company s cost estimate of the amount it will incur under the agreed upon or proposed work plans 
the company s cost estimate is based upon existing technology and has not been reduced by possible recoveries from third parties 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for remediation and long term monitoring of the sites 
a consent decree was signed in in settlement of a civil complaint brought by the us environmental protection agency and the us department of justice under which the company is subject to a compliance schedule by which the company improved its waste characterization procedures  upgraded one of its incinerators  and is evaluating and upgrading its industrial sewer system 
the total expenditures required to complete this program are currently estimated to be approximately million over the next nine years 
these expenditures are primarily capital in nature and  therefore  are not included in the environmental accrual at december  the company is presently designated as a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended the superfund law  or under similar state laws  for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the company s alleged arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances at six active superfund sites 
with respect to each of these sites  the company s actual or potential allocated share of responsibility is small 
furthermore  numerous other prps have also been designated at these sites and  although the law imposes joint and several liability on prps  the company s historical experience demonstrates that these costs are shared with other prps 
settlements and costs paid by the company in superfund matters to date have not been material 
future costs are also not expected to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
the clean air act amendments were enacted in expenditures to comply with the clean air act implementing regulations issued to date have not been material and have been primarily capital in nature 
in addition  future expenditures for existing regulations  which are primarily capital in nature  are not expected to be material 
many of the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to this act have not been issued 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
a finite estimate of cost does not normally become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability and the company continually updates its cost estimates 
it is reasonably possible that the company s recorded estimates of its liabilities may change and there is no assurance that additional costs greater than the amounts accrued will not be incurred or that changes in environmental laws or their interpretation will not require that additional amounts be spent 
factors which cause uncertainties for the company include  but are not limited to  the effectiveness of the current work plans in achieving targeted results and proposals of regulatory agencies for desired methods and outcomes 
it is possible that financial position  results of operations  cash flows or competitive positions could be affected by the impact of the ultimate resolution of these matters 
risk factors the following cautionary statements address a number of important factors that could cause the actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements contained in this document 
unanticipated delays in implementing certain product strategies including category expansion  digitization  oled displays and digital products would affect kodak s revenues 
the process for each product strategy is complex 
kodak s ability to successfully transition products and deploy new products requires that kodak make accurate predictions of the product development schedule as well as volumes  product mix  and customer demand 
the company may anticipate demand and perceived market acceptance that differs from the products realizable customer demand and revenue stream 
in addition  if the pricing element of each strategy is not sufficiently competitive with those of current and future competing products  kodak may lose market share  adversely affecting the company s revenues and prospects 
kodak s ability to implement its intellectual property licensing strategies could also affect the company s revenue and earnings 
kodak has invested millions of dollars in technologies and needs to protect its intellectual property 
the establishment and enforcement of licensing agreements provides a revenue stream that protects kodak s ability to further innovate and help the marketplace grow 
kodak s failure to properly manage the development of its intellectual property could adversely affect the future of these patents and the market opportunities that could result from the use of this property 
kodak s failure to manage the costs associated with the pursuit of these licenses could adversely affect the profitability of these operations 
in the event kodak were unable to align its e commerce strategies with the trend toward industry standards and services  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the availability of software and standards related to e commerce strategies is of an emerging nature 
kodak s ability to successfully align with the industry standards and services and ensure timely solutions  requires the company to make accurate predictions of the future accepted standards and services 
kodak s completion of planned information systems upgrades  including sap  if delayed  could adversely affect its business 
as kodak continues to expand the planned information services  the company must continue to balance the investment of the planned deployment with the need to upgrade the vendor software 
kodak s failure to successfully upgrade to the vendor supported version could result in risks to system availability  which could adversely affect the business 
kodak intends to complete various portfolio actions required to strengthen its digital imaging portfolio  consolidate the photofinishing operations worldwide and expand its services business 
in the event that kodak fails to effectively manage the highly profitable portfolio of its more traditional businesses simultaneously with the integration of these acquisitions and should kodak fail to streamline and simplify the business  kodak could lose market opportunities that result in an adverse impact on its revenue 
in  kodak continues to focus on reduction of inventories  improvement in receivable performance  reduction in capital expenditures  and improvement in manufacturing productivity 
unanticipated delays in continued inventory reduction could adversely impact kodak s cash outlook 
planned inventory reductions could be compromised by slower sales that could result from continued weak global economic conditions 
purchasers uncertainty about the extent of the global economic downturn could result in lower demand for products and services 
the competitive environment and the transition to digital products and services could also place pressures on kodak s sales and market share 
in the event kodak was unable to successfully manage these issues in a timely manner  they could adversely impact the planned inventory reductions 
unanticipated delays in the improvement plan for accounts receivable could also adversely impact kodak s cash outlook 
a continued weak economy could slow customer payment patterns 
competitive pressures in major segments may drive erosion in the financial condition of kodak s customers 
these same pressures may adversely affect efforts to shorten customer payment terms 
kodak s ability to manage customer risk while maintaining competitive share may adversely affect intended accounts receivable improvement in in addition  a delay in kodak s planned reduction in capital spending could adversely impact the company s cash outlook 
an increase in capital spending may occur if more projects than planned were found to generate significant positive returns in the future 
further  if the company deems it necessary to spend more on regulatory requirements or there are unanticipated general maintenance obligations requiring more capital spending than planned  the additional monies required would create an adverse impact on kodak s cash flow 
delays in kodak s planned improvement in manufacturing productivity could negatively impact the gross margins of the company 
again a continued weak economy could result in lower volumes in the factory than planned which would negatively impact gross margins 
kodak s failure to successfully manage operational performance factors could delay or curtail planned improvements in manufacturing productivity 
if kodak is unable to successfully negotiate raw material costs with its suppliers  or incurs adverse pricing on certain of its commodity based raw materials  reduction in the gross margins could occur 
kodak s planned improvement in supply chain efficiency  if delayed  could adversely affect its business by impacting the shipments of certain products in their desired quantities and in a timely manner 
the planned efficiencies could be compromised if kodak expands into new markets with new applications that are not fully understood or if the portfolio broadens beyond that anticipated when the plans were initiated 
the unforeseen changes in manufacturing capacity could compromise the supply chain efficiencies 
the risk of doing business in developing markets like china  india  brazil  argentina  mexico  russia and other economically volatile areas could adversely affect kodak s operations and earnings 
such risks include the financial instability among customers in these regions  the political instability and potential conflicts among developing nations and other non economic factors such as irregular trade flows that need to be managed successfully with the help of the local governments 
kodak has typically experienced longer accounts receivable cycles in emerging markets  in particular the latin american markets and the emerging markets of europe 
kodak s failure to successfully manage economic  political and other risks relating to doing business in developing countries and economically and politically volatile areas could adversely affect its business 
in early  the united states dollar was eliminated as argentina s monetary benchmark  resulting in significant currency devaluation 
the company engages in hedging programs aimed at limiting in part the impact of currency fluctuations and does not expect that the devaluation event in argentina will result in a future material charge 
however  there can be no guarantee that economic circumstances in argentina or elsewhere will not worsen  which could result in future effects on earnings should such events occur 
the company s failure to successfully manage economic  political and other risks relating to doing business in developing countries could adversely affect its business 
the company  as a result of its global operating and financing activities  is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
competition remains intense in the imaging sector in the consumer  commercial and health segments 
on the consumer side increased price competition has been driven somewhat by consumers conservative spending behaviors during times of economic weakness 
consumers have passed over branded products to private label products 
on the health and commercial side  aggressive pricing tactics intensified in the contract negotiations as competitors were vying for customers and market share domestically 
continued economic weakness could also adversely impact kodak s revenues and growth rate 
failure to successfully manage the consumers return to branded products if and when the economic conditions improve could adversely impact kodak s revenue and growth rate 
if the pricing and programs are not sufficiently competitive with those offered by kodak s current and future competitors  kodak may lose market share  adversely affecting its revenue and gross margins 
the company s strategy to balance the consumer shift from analog to digital  and the nature and pace of technology substitution could impact kodak s revenues  earnings and growth rate 
competition remains intense in the digital industry with a large number of competitors vying for customers and market share domestically and internationally 
kodak intends to continue new program introductions and competitive pricing to drive demands in the marketplace 
the process of developing new products and services is complex and often uncertain due to the frequent introduction of new products that offer improved performance and pricing 
kodak s ability to successfully transition products and deploy new products requires that kodak make accurate predictions of the product development schedule as well as volumes  product mix  customer demand and configuration 
kodak may anticipate demand and perceived market acceptance that differs from the product s realizable customer demand and revenue stream 
further  in the face of intense industry competition  any delay in the development  production or marketing of a new product could decrease any advantage kodak may have to be the first or among the first to market 
kodak s failure to carry out a product rollout in the time frame anticipated and in the quantities appropriate to customer demand could adversely affect the future demand for its products and services and have an adverse effect on its business 
the impact of continuing customer consolidation and buying power could have an adverse impact on kodak s revenue  gross margins  and earnings 
in the competitive consumer retail environment there is a movement from small individually owned retailers to larger and commonly known mass merchants 
in the commercial environment  there is a continuing consolidation of various group purchasing organizations 
the resellers and distributors may elect to use suppliers other than kodak 
kodak s challenge is to successfully negotiate contracts that provide the most favorable conditions to the company in the face of price and program aggressive competitors 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm the company s business and revenues 
the disruption of the company s business as a result of the terrorist attacks of september  on the united states  including transportation and supply chain disruptions and deferrals of customer purchasing decisions  had an immediate adverse impact on its business 
the long term effects of the september  attacks on the company s business and revenues are unknown 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect the company s business and revenues in the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
continued weak global economic conditions could adversely impact the company s revenues and growth rate 
continued softness in the company s markets and purchasers uncertainty about the extent of the global economic downturn could result in lower demand for products and services 
while worsening economic conditions have had a negative impact on results of operations  revenues  gross margins and earnings could further deteriorate as a result of economic conditions 
furthermore  there can be no assurances as to the timing of an economic upturn

summary of operating data a summary of operating data for and for the four years prior is shown on page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financing activities  is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and interest rates  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company may enter into derivative contracts 
see also note foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  especially those of the company s international treasury center  as well as forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany sales 
silver forward contracts are used to mitigate the company s risk to fluctuating silver prices 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates results from its investing and borrowing activities used to meet its liquidity needs 
long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments  while short term debt is used to meet working capital requirements 
an interest rate swap agreement was used to convert some floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
a sensitivity analysis indicates that if foreign currency exchange rates at december  and increased  the company would incur losses of million and million on foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  and  respectively 
such losses would be substantially offset by gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions hedged 
a sensitivity analysis indicates that  based on broker quoted termination values  if the price of silver decreased from spot rates at december  and  the fair value of silver forward contracts would be reduced by million and million  respectively 
such losses in fair value  if realized  would be offset by lower costs of manufacturing silver containing products 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities and  to a lesser extent  through investments in marketable securities 
the company utilizes us dollar denominated and foreign currency denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of short term and long term borrowings are in fixed rate instruments 
there is inherent roll over risk for debt and marketable securities as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
using a yield to maturity analysis  if december  interest rates increased about basis points with the current period s level of debt  there would be decreases in fair value of short term and long term borrowings of million and million  respectively 
if december  interest rates increased about basis points with the december  level of debt  there would be decreases in fair value of short term and long term borrowings of million and million  respectively 
the company s financial instrument counterparties are high quality investment or commercial banks with significant experience with such instruments 
the company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by requiring specific minimum credit standards and diversification of counterparties 
the company has procedures to monitor the credit exposure amounts 
the maximum credit exposure at december  was not significant to the company
