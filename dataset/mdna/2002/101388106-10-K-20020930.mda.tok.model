as a result  our solutions can be deployed quickly and efficiently 
to help our customers receive the maximum value and meet their own particular needs  we also provide professional services for installation  training  consulting and product enhancement  as well as related equipment and supplies 
during fiscal year  in order to expand our product offerings  we acquired nettransact  an electronic bill presentment and payment software product from the northern trust company 
we also acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from integrated cash management  inc  whose bankquest software offers powerful cash management tools and internet access to advanced banking applications 
in addition  we acquired all the outstanding shares of olc software  inc  whose smartcash product improves the efficiency of accounts receivable transactions 
during fiscal year  we acquired two companies  uk based checkpoint holdings  ltd 
now doing business as bottomline europe and flashpoint  inc flashpoint  a professional software development company 
in acquiring bottomline europe  we have opened a new distribution channel  expanded our international reach and increased our capacity to support our global customers and channel partners 
during fiscal year  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of evelocity corporation evelocity  a company that provides an electronic billing service for corporate legal departments 
on july   our board of directors authorized our repurchase of up to an additional million of our outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
our goal is to be the leading provider of software solutions that enable businesses and financial institutions to create an automated e business infrastructure to initiate  implement and manage the movements of cash 
our customer base  at over  companies  is in industries such as financial services  health care  technology  communications  education  media  manufacturing and government includes over half of the fortune companies and over of the ftse financial times companies 
our revenues are primarily derived from the following three sources software license fees 
we derive software license revenues from our software applications  which are generally based on the number of software applications and user licenses purchased  including paybase  nettransact  webseries  webseries electronic banking and ipoint 
fees from the sale of paybase and ipoint software licenses are generally recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer 
certain software arrangements  primarily nettransact  webseries and webseries electronic banking software fees  are often recognized on a percentage of completion basis due to the fact that they require significant customization and modification and extended implementation periods 
service and maintenance fees 
we derive service and maintenance revenues from a consulting  design  project management and training fees  which are fixed on a project to project basis  b customer support and maintenance fees  c customer specific customization of our products and d transactional service fees from our webseries legal e billing product and our transactional based product offerings 
revenues relating to custom consulting  design and service fees are recognized at the time services are rendered 
software maintenance fees are established as a percentage  typically  of the list price for the software license  and are prepaid annually 
support and maintenance agreements generally have a term of months and are renewable annually 
we recognize revenues related to customer support and maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period 
certain service contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis due to extensive customization and lengthy implementation 
revenues relating to our webseries legal e billing transactional services and our other transactional based product offerings are recognized at the time transactions are processed 
equipment and supplies revenues 
we derive equipment and supplies revenues from the sale of printers  check paper and magnetic ink character recognition toners 
these revenues are generally recognized at the time of delivery 
we record software development costs  upon the establishment of technological feasibility  in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
in the development of our new products and enhancements to existing products  the technological feasibility of the software is not established until substantially all product development is complete  including the development of a working model 
we have not had any software development costs that were capitalized during the last fiscal year and do not currently have any software development costs that are being capitalized  since all costs were incurred prior to attaining technological feasibility 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards  among other things  eliminated the pooling of interests method of accounting for acquisitions and required that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis 
sfas no 
was effective for all business combinations completed after june  sfas no 
must be adopted for fiscal years beginning after december  fiscal for us 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 intangible assets with finite useful lives will be amortized to their estimable residual values over those estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits consumed 
such intangible assets are subject to the impairment provisions of sfas no 
discussed below 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired  in lieu of being amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july  will continue to be amortized until adoption of sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no  we are required to perform a transitional impairment test on all indefinite lived intangible assets 
while the transition impairment test and related calculations have not been finalized  preliminary indications are that we will be subject to an impairment charge upon our adoption of sfas no 
on july  and that this charge could have a material impact on our financial statements 
to the extent that an impairment charge is required as a result of transitioning to the requirements of sfas no 
 it will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we expect to have this analysis completed during the first quarter of fiscal year additionally  under sfas  amounts that were previously capitalized and treated as the separate intangible asset assembled workforce will be reclassified to goodwill  since amounts paid relative to assembled workforce no longer meet the requirements of an intangible asset that can be separately stated 
effective july   we ceased the amortization of goodwill and any amounts reclassified to goodwill 
our amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce in the fiscal year ended june  was approximately million 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and provides a single accounting model for the disposal of long lived assets 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning after december  fiscal year and do not believe it will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf published its consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  which requires that all shipping and handling amounts billed to a customer be classified as revenue 
we adopted eitf effective april  prior to adoption  we had recorded such amounts as a reduction to cost of sales 
financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes have been reclassified to comply with the classification guidelines of eitf in april  the emerging issues task force published its consensus on eitf  vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  whereby consideration from a vendor to a reseller of the vendor s products is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue by the vendor 
as a result of our adoption of eitf effective april   we reclassified certain amounts paid to customers of our nettransact software from cost of revenues and sales and marketing expense to a reduction of revenue 
all prior period financial information has been reclassified to reflect the effects of the pronouncement on a comparative basis 
the effect on prior periods also includes the reclassification  for the year ended june   of  from sales and marketing expense expense associated with warrants issued to a reduction of revenues 
this amount represents the cumulative  customer specific revenues from the customers to whom we issued the warrants 
the excess of the warrant value over the cumulative  customer specific revenues remains characterized as an expense  as permitted by eitf other than the aforementioned reclassification of amounts previously expensed in connection with warrants issued by us  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force published its consensus on eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which requires that all out of pocket expenses billed to a customer be classified as revenue with the offsetting cost recorded as cost of revenue 
our out of pocket expenses generally include  but are not limited to  employee travel related expenses 
we had previously treated customer reimbursement for such expenses as a reduction to cost of revenue  and have reclassified amounts billed to customers as service and maintenance revenue upon our adoption of the pronouncement on january  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes have been reclassified to comply with the classification guidelines of eitf no 
reclassifications certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation as more fully described in notes and of our consolidated financial statements 
recent developments on july   our board of directors authorized our repurchase of up to an additional million of our outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  revenues software licenses service and maintenance equipment and supplies total revenues cost of revenues software licenses service and maintenance equipment and supplies total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expense associated with warrants issued product development and engineering product development and engineering in process research and development stock compensation expense general and administrative general and administrative amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net loss before income taxes income taxes n a n a n a net loss critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance 
we refer to such policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate  and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used 
these critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition  intangible assets and our equity investments 
these critical policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are discussed below 
in addition  refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of all of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from the sale of licenses  services and maintenance  and equipment and supplies 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
we consider a non cancelable purchase order or agreement to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to have occurred upon transfer of title to the customer  or completion of services rendered 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment  or if we have not granted extended payment terms to the customer our normal payment terms do not exceed days 
we consider collection to be probable if our internal credit analysis indicates that the customer will be able to pay amounts as they become due under the arrangement 
our sales arrangements may contain multiple revenue elements  such as software products  services  hardware and post contract customer support 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate element treatment is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
revenue is recognized for each element when the aforementioned revenue recognition criteria have been met 
certain of our software development arrangements require significant customization and modification and extended implementation periods 
such arrangements do not qualify for separate element revenue recognition treatment  as described above  and must be accounted for under contract accounting 
under contract accounting  companies must select from two generally accepted methods of accounting the completed contract method and the percentage of completion method 
the completed contract method recognizes revenue only upon contract completion  and all project costs and revenues are reported as deferred items in the balance sheet until that time 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue on a contract as the work progresses  as a percentage of cumulative costs incurred compared to the total estimated project costs 
we have historically used the percentage of completion method of accounting for our long term and custom contracts  since we believe that we can make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion and total contract costs 
accordingly  the revenue we record in any reporting period for sales arrangements accounted for on a percentage of completion basis is dependent upon our estimates of the remaining costs that will be incurred in completing our contractual obligations 
our estimates of total contract costs at the end of any reporting period could be materially different from actual contract costs  as determined only at subsequent stages of project completion 
we solicit the input of our project professional staff at the end of each reporting period  for purposes of evaluating estimates toward completion  so that our estimates are based on the most recent project projections 
goodwill and intangible assets we periodically review our goodwill and intangible assets for indicators of impairment 
impairment indicators include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that affects the value of an asset  and a significant adverse change in current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historic or projected continuing losses associated with an asset 
if indicators of impairment are present  an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate must be made to ensure that the carrying value of the asset can be recovered 
the undiscounted cash flow estimates used for purposes of determining whether asset impairment exists include the cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
there are numerous variables that we must consider when estimating an asset s future cash flows 
significant judgment  and inherent uncertainty  is involved in the formulation of these estimates  which are only verifiable over time 
such estimates include  but are not limited to our overall revenue growth and mix of revenue  our gross margin estimates which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue  our planned level of operating expenses  and our effective tax rate 
whenever  as a result of these estimates  the carrying value of an asset is determined to be in excess of its future undiscounted cash flows  the asset is written down to its fair value 
at june   the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets  million  was expected to be recovered through future  undiscounted cash flows 
equity investments we hold certain equity investments in non publicly traded companies in which we do not exercise significant influence 
these investments are included in other assets and are accounted for on a cost basis 
under the cost method of accounting  investments in non publicly traded companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in their fair values 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of these investments for purposes of determining recoverability 
this evaluation consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors by us  including a review of the investee s financial condition  results of operations  operating trends and financial ratios and the investee s forecasts and projections 
we also consider the investee s access to capital ie  equity capital or other financing alternatives 
should our analysis of these factors prove to be incorrect  our results of operations could be misstated 
during the fiscal years ended june  and  we recorded a charge of  and  respectively  related to impairment that we judged to be other than temporary in certain of our investments 
the remaining carrying value of all such investments at june  was  fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues total revenues decreased by million to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of 
software licenses 
software license fees decreased by million to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of 
software license fees represented of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in software license fees in dollars and as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the current economic conditions and reduced capital spending by our customers and potential customers  offset by a full year of revenue contribution from bottomline europe 
in addition  our strong service and maintenance revenues further reduced software licenses as a percentage of total revenues 
based on current plans  we anticipate that fiscal year software license fees will increase slightly over fiscal year levels 
service and maintenance 
service and maintenance fees increased by million to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june   an increase of 
service and maintenance fees represented of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  the increase in service and maintenance fees as a percentage of revenues was due to a full year of revenue contribution from bottomline europe  two months of service revenues contributed by our evelocity acquisition  strong recurring maintenance revenues from our existing installed customer base  as well as lower software license fees in fiscal year based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year service and maintenance fees will increase slightly over fiscal year levels as a result of a full year of revenues contributed by evelocity 
equipment and supplies 
equipment and supplies sales decreased by approximately  to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june   relatively unchanged year over year 
equipment and supplies sales represented of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year equipment and supplies sales will approximate fiscal year levels 
cost of revenues software licenses 
software license costs consist of expenses incurred by us to manufacture  package and distribute our software products and related documentation  costs of licensing third party software incorporated into our products  and royalties to northern trust on revenues from our nettransact product 
software license costs decreased by approximately  to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of 
software license costs decreased to of software license fees in the fiscal year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in software license costs was due primarily to the associated decrease in software license revenues 
the decrease of software license costs as a percentage of software license revenues was due primarily to a write down  in the fiscal year ended june   of third party software acquired for resale and held in inventory  partially offset by a full year contribution from bottomline europe 
based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year software license costs  as a percentage of revenues  will approximate fiscal year levels 
service and maintenance 
service and maintenance costs include salary expense and other related costs for our customer service  maintenance and help desk support staffs  as well as third party contractor expenses used to complement our professional services team 
service and maintenance costs increased by approximately  to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june   an increase of 
service and maintenance costs were of service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to of service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended june  the increase in service and maintenance costs was due primarily to a higher number of percentage of completion revenue projects during the year 
these percentage of completion revenue projects generally require additional resources from our development team  which then become part of service and maintenance cost of sales 
the decrease in service and maintenance costs as a percentage of service and maintenance revenues is primarily the result of cost reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year service and maintenance costs  as a percentage of revenues  will approximate fiscal levels 
equipment and supplies 
equipment and supplies costs remained unchanged at million in the fiscal years ended june  and june  equipment and supplies costs were of equipment and supplies sales in the fiscal years ended june  and based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year equipment and supplies costs  as a percentage of revenues  will approximate fiscal year levels

sales and marketing expenses were of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year ended june  the dollar decrease in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to cost reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by a full year of sales and marketing expenses from our bottomline europe and flashpoint acquisitions 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will decrease  as a percentage of total revenues  in fiscal year product development and engineering product development and engineering 
product development and engineering expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development 
our product development and engineering organization consisted of persons as of june  we primarily focus on one significant development project at any given time  in addition to providing technical support of our current products

product development and engineering expenses increased by approximately  to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june   an increase of 
before the stock compensation expense described below  product development and engineering expenses were of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year ended june  the dollar increase was due primarily to a full year of flashpoint and bottomline europe product development and engineering expenses  as well as additional development personnel expenses from our evelocity acquisition 
due to cost reductions implemented in the first quarter of fiscal  we anticipate that product development and engineering expenses will decrease  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal year stock compensation expense 
in connection with our acquisition of flashpoint  we assumed all of the outstanding common stock options of flashpoint  which were exchanged for options to purchase our common stock  and recorded deferred compensation of million relating to the intrinsic value of the unvested options 
the deferred compensation is being amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period of the options and resulted in  and  of stock compensation expense for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
we expect stock compensation expense to remain consistent in fiscal year general and administrative general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations  finance  information technologies  legal and accounting services and general corporate overhead

we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal year amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased by million to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  the increase in current year amortization is due to a full year of amortization expense associated with the acquisitions of bottomline europe and flashpoint 
upon adoption of sfas on july   we ceased amortization of goodwill and any amounts reclassified to goodwill 
we anticipate that our amortization of intangible assets will decrease by approximately million with the adoption of this accounting change

net intangible assets and goodwill of million at june  were of total assets and of stockholders equity 
other income expense  net interest income

interest expense 
interest expense was  in the fiscal year ended june  compared to million in the fiscal year ended june  the interest expense in the fiscal year ended june  was due to interest expense on promissory notes issued in connection with our acquisition of bottomline europe  which  as more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements  were retired in exchange for our common stock in the quarter ended june  other expense  net

the valuation allowance increased by million in the fiscal year ended june  net loss 
net loss decreased by million to a million loss in the fiscal year ended june  from a million loss in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in net loss was due primarily to cost reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal year along with the reduction in interest expense offset by a decrease in revenue generally  and software revenue specifically  which carries higher gross margins than our other revenue streams

net loss 
net loss increased by million to a million loss in the fiscal year ended june  from a million loss in the fiscal year ended june  the increase in net loss was due primarily to acquisition related charges and the increased operating costs associated with our acquisitions

the valuation allowance increased by million in the fiscal year ended june  on march   there was a change in the us federal tax law to allow companies to carryback  for an additional three year period  net operating losses for the tax years ending and as a result of this change  we recorded approximately  in federal tax refunds

we believe that the cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we also may receive additional investments from  and make investments in  customers or other companies 
certain factors that may affect future results investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision involving our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could fall  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
the slowdown in the economy has affected the market for information technology solutions  including our products and services  and if this slowdown continues our future financial results could be materially adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending by our customers and potential customers  demand for our products and services has been adversely affected 
this has resulted in decreased revenues and a decline in our growth rate 
our future results will be materially and adversely affected if this slowdown continues and our revenues continue to be adversely impacted 
in connection with the economic slowdown  we previously implemented several cost reduction initiatives in order to improve our profitability 
if current economic conditions continue or worsen  these cost reductions may prove to be inadequate and we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our common stock has experienced and may continue to undergo extreme market price and volume fluctuations stock markets in general  and the nasdaq stock market in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  especially in recent years 
broad market fluctuations of this type may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that often have been unrelated to their operating performance 
the market price of our common stock has experienced  and may continue to undergo extreme fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including general and industry specific business  economic and market conditions  actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  including as a result of any impairment of goodwill related to our past acquisitions  changes in or our failure to meet  analysts or investors estimates or expectations  public announcements concerning us  including announcements of litigation  our competitors or our industry  introductions of new products or services or announcements of significant contracts by us or our competitors  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  or capital commitments by us or our competitors  adverse developments in patent or other proprietary rights  and announcements of technological innovations by our competitors 
our fixed costs may lead to operating results below external expectations if our revenues are below anticipated levels  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock a significant percentage of our expenses  particularly personnel and facilities costs  are relatively fixed and based in part on anticipated revenue levels 
we have undergone  and are currently experiencing  slowing revenue growth rates due to the economic slowdown 
a decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expense growth could negatively affect our business 
significant revenue shortfalls in any quarter may cause significant declines in operating results since we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner 
quarterly operating results that are below the expectations of public market analysts could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the following economic conditions which may affect our customers and potential customers budgets for information technology expenditures  the timing of orders and longer sales cycles  particularly due to the increased average sales price of our software solutions  the timing of product implementations  which are highly dependent on customers resources and discretion  the incurrence of costs relating to the integration of software products and operations in connection with acquisitions of technologies or businesses  the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by either us or our competitors  and delivery interruptions relating to equipment and supplies purchased from third party vendors 
because of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
as a result of our acquisitions  we could be subject to significant future write offs with respect to intangible assets that may adversely affect our future operating results as of june   we had unamortized goodwill and intangible assets of million from prior acquisitions 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
upon adoption of sfas no  we are required to perform a transitional impairment test on all indefinite lived intangible assets 
while the transition impairment test and related calculations have not been finalized  preliminary indications are that we will be subject to an impairment charge upon our adoption of sfas no 
on july  and that this charge could have a material impact on our financial statements 
we face risks associated with our international operations that could harm our financial condition and results of operations in recent periods  a significant percentage of our revenues has been generated by our international operations  and our future growth rates and success are in part dependent on continued growth and success in international markets 
as is the case with most international operations  the success and profitability of our international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that include  in addition to the risks our business as a whole faces  the following difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  differing regulatory and industry standards and certification requirements  the complexities of foreign tax jurisdictions  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and import or export licensing requirements 
a significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from our payment management offerings and our performance will depend on continued market acceptance of these solutions a significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from the license and maintenance of our payment management offerings and sales of associated products and services 
any significant reduction in demand for our payment management offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future performance could depend on the following factors continued market acceptance of our payment management offerings as a payment management solution  prospective customers dependence upon enterprises seeking to enhance their payment functions to integrate electronic payment capabilities  our ability to introduce enhancements to meet the market s evolving needs for secure payments and cash management solutions  and continued acceptance of desktop and enterprise software and laser check printing solutions 
our future financial results will depend upon the acceptance of electronic invoice presentment product offerings in an emerging market our electronic invoice presentment business model is in the early stages of market adoption  even though the product has been generally available from us and our competitors for some time 
the market for this product may not be ready to adopt our electronic invoice presentment business model  or may be slower to adopt the model than we  or the public market analysts  anticipate 
if this emerging market does not adopt our business model or does not respond as quickly as we expect  our future results could be materially and adversely affected 
our mix of products and services could have a significant effect on our financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our stock our products and services have considerably varied gross margins 
software margins in general yield significantly higher gross margins than do our service  maintenance  equipment and supplies revenue streams 
in the past year we have experienced a decrease in software license fees 
if software license fees continue to decline or if the mix of our products and services in any given period does not match our expectations  our results of operations and the market price of our stock could be significantly impacted 
our success depends on the widespread adoption of the internet as a medium for electronic business our future success will in large part depend upon the willingness of businesses and financial institutions to adopt the internet as a medium of e business 
these entities will probably accept this medium only if the internet provides substantially greater efficiency and enhances their competitiveness 
there are critical issues involved in the commercial use of the internet that are not yet fully resolved  including concerns regarding the internet s security  reliability  ease of access and quality of service 
to the extent that any of these issues inhibit or limit the adoption of the internet as a medium of e commerce  our business prospects could be adversely affected 
if electronic business does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected  demand for our products and services may be reduced 
we face significant competition in our targeted markets  including competition from companies with significantly greater resources in recent years we have encountered increasing competition in our targeted markets 
we compete with a wide range of companies  ranging from small start up enterprises with limited resources  which compete principally on the basis of technology features or specific customer relationships  to large companies  which can leverage significant customer bases and financial resources 
given the size and nature of our targeted markets  the implementation of our growth strategy and our success in competing for market share generally may be dependent on our ability to grow our sales and marketing capabilities and maintain a critical level of financial resources 
if we are unable to do so  we could lose market share to competitors 
integration of acquisitions or strategic investments could interrupt our business and our financial condition could be harmed we have made several acquisitions of companies in the past and may  in the future  acquire or make investments in other businesses  products or technologies 
any acquisitions or strategic investments we have made in the past or may make in the future may entail numerous risks that include the following difficulties integrating acquired operations  personnel  technologies or products  diversion of management s focus from our core business concerns  write offs related to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience or knowledge  exposure to litigation from stockholders or creditors of  or other parties affiliated with  the target company or companies  dilution to existing stockholders and earnings per share  and incurrence of substantial debt 
any such difficulties encountered as a result of any mergers  acquisitions or strategic investments could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on key employees who are skilled in e commerce  payment  cash management and invoice presentment methodology and internet and other technologies our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and key technical employees who are skilled in e commerce  payment methodology and regulation  and internet  database and network technologies 
the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we currently do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our employees 
while some of our executive officers have employment agreements with us  the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must attract and retain highly skilled personnel with knowledge in e commerce  payment  cash management and invoice presentment methodology and internet and other technologies we are dependent upon the ability to attract  hire  train and retain highly skilled technical  sales and marketing  and support personnel  particularly with expertise in e commerce  payment  cash management and invoice methodology and internet and other technologies 
competition for qualified personnel is intense 
as a result we may experience increased compensation costs that may not be offset through either improved productivity or higher sales prices 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in attracting  recruiting or in retaining existing personnel 
based on our experience  it takes an average of nine months for a salesperson to become fully productive 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in increasing the productivity of our sales personnel  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
an increasing number of large and more complex customer contracts may impact the timing of our revenue recognition and affect our operating results  financial condition and the market price of our stock due to an increasing number of large and more complex customer contracts  we have experienced  and will continue to experience  delays in the timing of our revenue recognition 
these large and complex customer contracts generally require significant implementation work  product customization and modification resulting in the recognition of revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
delays in revenue recognition on these contracts could affect our operating results  financial condition and the market price of our stock 
increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our product solutions the payments and electronic invoice presentment software markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
some competitors in our targeted markets have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  and marketing resources  greater brand recognition and a larger installed customer base than we do 
we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the markets for payment and electronic invoice presentment software solutions 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to expand their product offerings and to offer more comprehensive solutions 
this growing competition may result in price reductions of our products and services  reduced revenues and gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced software  services and related products the payments and electronic invoice presentment software markets in which we compete are subject to rapid technological change and our success is dependent on our ability to develop new and enhanced software  services and related products that meet evolving market needs 
trends that could have a critical impact on us include rapidly changing technology  which could cause our software to become suddenly outdated or could require us to make our products compatible with new database or network systems  evolving industry standards  mandates and laws  such as those mandated by the national automated clearing house association and the association for payment clearing services  and developments and changes relating to the internet that we must address as we maintain existing products and introduce any new products 
there can be no assurance that technological advances will not cause our technology to become obsolete or uneconomical 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products  or enhancements to existing products  in a timely and successful manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
any unanticipated performance problems or bugs in our product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results if the products that we offer do not continue to achieve market acceptance  our future financial results will be adversely affected 
since some of our software solutions are still in early stages of adoption  any unanticipated performance problems or bugs that we have not been able to detect could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  negative publicity regarding us and our products  harm to our customer relationships and exposure to potential liability claims 
in addition  if these products do not enjoy wide commercial success  our long term business strategy will be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and could be subject to litigation regarding our intellectual property rights  causing serious harm to our business we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws and non disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we cannot assure you that our patents  pending applications for patents that may be issued in the future  or other intellectual property will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology or any commercial advantage to us  or that the patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
we enter into agreements with our employees and customers that seek to limit and protect the distribution of proprietary information 
despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that such rights will remain protected or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we may be a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights or as a result of an alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
these claims could require us to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product installments  develop non infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claim 
these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may incur significant costs from class action litigation as a result of expected volatility in our common stock in the past  companies that have experienced market price volatility of their stock have been the targets of securities class action litigation 
in august  we were named as a party in one of the so called laddering securities class action suits relating to the underwriting of our initial public offering 
we could incur substantial costs and experience a diversion of our management s attention and resources in connection with such litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future financial results could depend on our ability to manage growth effectively in the past  rapid growth has strained our managerial and other resources 
while we have not experienced rapid growth in the past fiscal year  if we are able to achieve growth in the future  our ability to manage such growth will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our operating  financial and management information systems 
we cannot assure you that our personnel  systems and controls will be adequate to support any future growth 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  should it occur  the quality of our services  our ability to retain key personnel and our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to financial risk  including changes in interest rates  relates primarily to cash and cash equivalents 
these investments bear interest at a variable interest rate  which is subject to market changes 
we have not entered into any interest rate swap agreements  or other instruments to minimize our exposure to interest rate increases 
we have not had any derivative instruments in the past and do not presently plan to in the future 
for purposes of specific risk analysis we use sensitivity analysis to determine the impacts that market risk exposure may have on the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
to perform the sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on market sensitive instruments 
we compare the market values for interest risk based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in the rates 
we selected discount rates for the present value computations based on market interest rates in effect at june  we compared the market values resulting from these computations with the market values of these financial instruments at june  the differences in the comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
our investment portfolio consists of demand deposit accounts  money market mutual funds and investment accounts 
due to the short term average maturity of the investment portfolio  a sudden sharp change in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the value of the portfolio 
based on our investment portfolio and interest rates  a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively  in our results from operations and cash flows 
a portion of our operations is located in the united kingdom  where the local currency is british pound sterling the pound 
although the pound has not historically experienced significant fluctuations over short periods of time  our financial results could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
a increase or decrease in the average exchange rate between the pound and the dollar would result in an increase or decrease to revenue and net income loss  for the fiscal year ended june   of approximately  and  respectively 
a increase or decrease in the average exchange rate between the pound and the dollar  for the fiscal year ended june   would result in an increase or decrease to revenue and net income loss of approximately  and  respectively 
we did not have operations located in the united kingdom in the fiscal year ended june
