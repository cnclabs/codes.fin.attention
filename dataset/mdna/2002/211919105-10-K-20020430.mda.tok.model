convera was established through the combination of the former excalibur technologies corporation and intel corporation s interactive media services division 
on december   excalibur and intel consummated a business combination transaction pursuant to an agreement and plan of contribution and merger  dated as of april   as amended  by and among excalibur  intel  the company and excalibur transitory  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
at the completion of the combination  excalibur became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  each outstanding share of excalibur common stock was converted into one share of class a common stock of the company  and intel contributed to the company its ims division  intellectual property assets and other assets used by that division  as well as  in cash at closing  in exchange for  shares of class a common stock of the company and  shares of class b non voting common stock of the company 
the combination was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price for the ims division was determined to be approximately million  which included approximately million in transaction costs  less approximately  in costs to register and issue the shares 
the shares issued to intel as consideration for the contributed assets were valued based on the existing market price when the combination was announced 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date 
in connection with the combination  the company recorded approximately million in goodwill and recorded a charge for acquired in process research and development iprd of approximately  in the fiscal year ended january  the purchased iprd represented the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology  which  at december   had not yet reached technological feasibility 
the cash flow projections for revenues were based on estimates of market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of product introduction and the estimated life of the underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses and income taxes were deducted from estimated revenue projections to arrive at estimated after tax cash flows 
projected operating expenses include cost of sales  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
the other intangible assets acquired from intel included certain developed technology and an existing workforce as well as certain existing and in process customer contracts 
the ims division had contracts in process at the time of the combination  which were being accounted for using the completed contract method  and accordingly  revenue was deferred until all remaining costs  obligations and potential risks were insignificant and the contract deliverables were agreed to and accepted by the customer 
convera continued to account for the existing contributed contracts using the completed contract method of accounting 
for purposes of determining the value of these contributed contracts at the date of acquisition  management considered the total amounts to be received under each contract 
as these contracts were completed by convera  revenue and the related costs  including profit on work performed by convera subsequent to the acquisition  were recognized 
during fiscal year  the company completed all obligations under the in process contract assigned by the ims division  and accordingly recognized revenue during the year of about million related to these contracts 
the associated costs recorded during fiscal year related to these contracts was approximately million 
existing contracts that were completed prior to january  resulted in aggregate revenue recognition of approximately million recorded as services revenues and approximately million recorded as software revenues 
the associated costs recognized related to these contracts were approximately million included in cost of services revenues and approximately million included in cost of software revenues 
in september  intel and the nba entered into a master services agreement  which intel contributed to convera on december   for the distribution of personalized highlights  archival material  television broadcast enhancements and real time distribution of nba games over broadband networks 
in addition to the services agreement  convera entered into a contribution agreement with the nba  under which the nba contributed certain intangible assets such as all of the nba know how related to the creation  development  distribution  marketing and deployment  over the internet and broadband networks  of products using sports and entertainment content  a database of customer profiles of nba fans  the right to use certain nba personnel and a non exclusive license to the nba trademark 
in exchange for the contribution of these assets  convera issued  shares of class a common stock  representing of the total outstanding stock of the company on that date 
on september   the company announced that it had terminated its agreement with the nba to provide interactive content services 
on october   the company announced a restructuring plan to consolidate all operations around the development  marketing  sales and support of its enterprise class information infrastructure software products  retrievalware and screening room 
the company also announced that it was eliminating operations supporting the development of the company s digital content security technology and interactive services offerings and closing offices in hillsboro  oregon and lafayette  colorado 
following the termination of the nba contract and the company s change in focus  the company evaluated the recoverability of the intangible and other long lived assets including goodwill associated with the combination and associated with the nba agreement 
the intangible assets acquired in the combination  including developed technology  customer contracts and assembled workforce  were primarily related to the interactive media services offerings 
as a result of the evaluation  the company recorded a charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal year for reduction of goodwill and other long lived assets 
on december   the company reported that it purchased the  shares of convera common stock owned by the nba for million in a privately negotiated transaction 
on january   the company reported that it purchased  shares of convera s voting class a common stock and  shares of convera s non voting class b common stock from intel for a total of million in a privately negotiated transaction 
the company also reported a simultaneous transaction between allen holding inc and intel corporation  whereby allen holding inc purchased the remaining  shares of convera class a common stock owned by intel  resulting in allen holding inc beneficially owning of the outstanding shares of convera class a common stock 
as a result of these transactions  intel and the nba hold no ownership interest in convera as of january  all references in this form k to financial results for the company for the period prior to december  reflect the historical financial results of excalibur and its subsidiaries 
critical accounting policies convera s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for a comprehensive discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
convera does not have any material ownership interest in any entities that are not wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries of the company 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases those estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring costs  income taxes and litigation  on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
convera believes the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition convera s recognition of revenues requires judgment  particularly in the areas of collectibility and whether the fee is fixed and determinable at the time the sales are made 
the company bases its judgment on a variety of factors including the payment and other terms of the individual customer contracts  credit history of the customer  prior dealings with specific customers  and certain other factors 
if the company determines that the price under the contract is fixed and determinable  and that collectibility is assured  then the company recognized revenue related to the software license at the time of sale 
to the extent the company determines that the price of a sales agreement is not fixed  the company delays revenue recognition until payments under the contract become due 
alternatively  to the extent the company determines that the collection of payments under the contracts is not assured  the company delays revenue recognition until the payments under the contract are received 
the revenue associated with other elements of the contract are deferred and recognized as those elements are delivered 
thus the assessment as to whether the fee is fixed and determinable at the time of sale and that the fees are collectible is critical in determining the extent the revenue recognized in a given period 
customization work is sometimes required to ensure that the company s software functionality meets the requirements of its customers 
in those instances where the company s revenues are generated from fixed price contracts related to this customization work  then revenue is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of actual costs incurred to total costs estimated over the duration of the contract 
these estimates regarding costs underlie the company s determinations as to overall contract profitability and the timing of revenue recognition 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then actual results may differ from projected results and losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause the company s operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
provision for doubtful accounts convera maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of individual accounts receivable balances  including the credit worthiness of each customer and the period in which customers financial condition deteriorate and they are no longer able to pay the balances owed to convera 
to the extent convera does not recognize deterioration in its customers financial condition in the period it occurs  or to the extent convera underestimates its customers ability to pay  the amount of bad debt expense recognized in a given reporting resulting will be impacted 
goodwill and other intangible assets convera s acquisitions of other companies typically result in the acquisition of certain intangible assets and goodwill 
these assets are subject to impairment to the extent the company s operations experience significant negative results 
these negative results can be the result of convera s individual operations or negative trends in the convera customer s industry or in the general economy  which impact convera 
to the extent convera s intangible assets or goodwill are determined to be impaired  then these balances are written down to their estimated fair value on the date of the impairment 
determining when an impairment has occurred involves a significant amount of judgment 
management bases its judgment on a number of factors including viability of the businesses acquired  their integration into convera s operations  the market in which those businesses operate and their projected future results  cash flows projections  and numerous other factors 
the results reported in any given period are impacted by management s determination as to when an impairment has occurred 
during the year ended january  convera determined that the goodwill and certain intangible assets recorded by the company in the prior year were impaired and convera recorded a charge of million related to that impairment 
deferred taxes convera records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of projected future taxable income 
if the estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation against its deferred tax assets  resulting in a benefit or a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
as of january   the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended january   total revenues were million  a decline of over total revenues of million in fiscal year the net loss for fiscal year was million  or per common share  compared to a net loss of million  or per common share in the prior year 
for the fiscal year ended january   total revenues increased over total revenues of million in fiscal year the net loss for fiscal year was million  or 
per common share 
the company uses ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and certain other charges as an additional measure of performance 
ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or as an indicator of convera s operating performance 
the company believes that ebitda is widely used by analysts  investors and other interested parties as a financial measure 
ebitda is not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies 
for the fiscal year ended january   on an ebitda basis and excluding other charges of approximately million see below  the loss was million  or per common share  compared to an ebitda loss of million  or per common share in fiscal year for fiscal year  ebitda was a positive million  or per common share 
the following charts summarize the components of revenues and the categories of expenses  including the amounts expressed as a percentage of total revenues  and ebitda for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended january  dollars in thousands

the increase in software revenues in fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased sales of the company s software products to larger corporations and government organizations building intranets  sales to online service providers and e commerce businesses and sales to the original equipment manufacturer oem market 
during the year ended january   the company recognized approximately million from an oem agreement with ncr  which provided ncr with the rights to integrate the company s products in the ncr tor solution 
under this arrangement  ncr also had the right to resell the company s full product line 
ncr will pay the company royalties when they resell the company s products to end users 
no value was assigned to the reseller arrangement since ncr was not obligated to resell the company s products 
thus  all of the consideration received in connection with this contract was assigned to the integration services 
revenues derived from the ncr agreement were approximately million for the year ended january  and million for the year ended january  the company also generated approximately million in fiscal year from an oem arrangement with storagetek 
maintenance revenues were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the slight decrease in maintenance revenues in fiscal year is attributable to the decline in license revenues this fiscal year as well as the conclusion  at the end of the second quarter this year  of a specific long term maintenance agreement that had yielded approximately million in quarterly maintenance revenues 
the fiscal year increase in maintenance revenues as a percentage of license related revenues is attributable to an increase in maintenance pricing implemented at the end of fiscal year and an overall improvement in the pursuit of maintenance renewals for existing customers 
the increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal year was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of retrievalware customers generated during fiscal year and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year revenues from interactive services in fiscal year were approximately million compared to million in fiscal year in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company announced that it was eliminating operations supporting its interactive services offerings 
the services revenue recorded in fiscal year represented the completion of one of the contracts assigned in the combination accounted for under the completed contract method of accounting 
revenues from international operations are provided primarily by software licenses with various european commercial and government customers and a well established european reseller network

cost of software revenues increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year fiscal year cost of software revenues increased from million in fiscal year the increase in cost of software revenues in fiscal year is primarily attributable to an increase in the amortization of prepaid third party royalty licensing costs  which have been incurred to add new features and functionality to the company s products  as well as an increase in the cost of professional services resulting from the increase in the number of employees in the company s professional services group 
the increase in fiscal year was related primarily to the sales volume increase and greater royalty expense associated with new features included in the company s products that were derived from other third party software products 
cost of maintenance increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year in fiscal year  cost of maintenance decreased from million in fiscal year as a percentage of maintenance revenues  cost of maintenance was  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of maintenance in fiscal year is attributable to an increase in personnel and related expenses in the customer support organization  while the decrease in cost of maintenance in fiscal year was due to changes implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal year that streamlined the customer support organization  thus reducing overall costs of maintenance 
cost of services represents the personnel and other direct costs incurred in connection with performing on the company s interactive service related contracts 
for the year ended january   the cost of services was approximately compared to million in fiscal year operating expenses sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  representing and of total revenues  respectively 
in fiscal year  sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses were of total revenues in fiscal year the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal year was due to growth in sales and marketing personnel and increased spending on marketing programs  as well as an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts

research and product development costs increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  representing and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal year  research and product development costs increased from million in fiscal year research and product development costs were of revenues in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year is largely due to the addition of a significant number of engineering personnel in connection with the business combination with the ims division of intel  as well as the company s continued investment to enhance the retrievalware and screening room products 
the number of engineering personnel was reduced in the restructuring actions taken in the second and third quarters of fiscal year  resulting in a total of people employed in research and product development activities at january  the fiscal year expense increase was due to growth in the text and video product engineering staffs and the addition of engineering personnel in connection with the merger with intel s ims division

at january   the number of general and administrative personnel was  compared to at january  the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal year was due to growth in personnel required to support the company s expanding operations 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately million for the year ended january  and million for the year ended january  the majority of these amounts relate to amortization of goodwill and intangible assets related to the company s business combination with intel s ims division  which was accounted for using the purchase method 
the amounts also include amortization of the intangible assets acquired from the nba pursuant to the contribution agreement 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the combination was stopped effective october   when the company determined that such assets were impaired and wrote down the remaining unamortized balance to zero see further explanation below 
the amount of amortization recorded for the year ended january  primarily represented amortization associated with the combination from the december  closing date to the end of the fiscal year 
amortization expense of  for the year ended january  related to goodwill from an acquisition made in the second quarter of fiscal year incentive bonus payments due to employees were approximately million for the year ended january  specified former intel employees who became convera employees and remain employed through september  will receive a payment for the excess  if any  of the calculated aggregate gain they would have realized on forfeited intel stock options  based on the fair value of intel shares at a fixed date prior to the closing of the merger  that would have vested between and over the calculated aggregate gain on convera stock options as of september  the maximum aggregate amount that convera could be required to pay  assuming no aggregate gain on the convera stock options at september   is approximately million 
the company is amortizing this amount over the period leading up to september  and  as such  has recorded bonus expense of approximately million as of january  additionally  in may  the company paid approximately million in bonuses to specified former employees of intel that remained employed by convera as of april  these bonus payments were funded through an additional capital contribution from intel 
the bonus amounts were contingent upon the former intel employees continued employment at convera  and the company recorded this bonus in operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company implemented a restructuring plan in response to the downturn in the economy and in conjunction with the integration of the ims division s operations following the combination with intel 
this restructuring resulted in a reduction of convera s total workforce by employees  including individuals from the company s engineering group and five individuals from the business development group 
as part of this restructuring  the company also reduced the number of independent contractors that were working on behalf of the company by approximately contractors and reduced the amount of space to be used in certain of the company s leased facilities 
on october   the company announced an additional restructuring plan to consolidate all operations around the development  marketing  sales and support of its enterprise class information infrastructure software products  retrievalware and screening room 
the company also announced that it was eliminating operations supporting the development of the company s digital content security technology and interactive services offerings and closing offices in hillsboro  oregon and lafayette  colorado 
as a result of this restructuring  convera s total workforce was reduced by an additional employees  including employees of the engineering group  from the professional services and training groups  seven from the g a group and two from the marketing group 
as a result of the restructuring plans  the company recorded restructuring charges in the second and third fiscal quarters of fiscal year of million and million  respectively  for a total of million in restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges include approximately million in costs incurred under contractual obligations with no future economic benefit to the company  accruals of approximately million for employee termination costs and approximately million related to future facility losses for the offices closed in hillsboro  oregon and lafayette  colorado 
the company paid a total of million through january  against the restructuring accruals recorded in the current fiscal year

remaining expenditures relating to employee severance costs will be substantially paid during the first quarter of fiscal year amounts related to contractual obligations will be paid within one year 
the company expects to settle charges associated with facility closings over the remaining term of the related facility leases  which is through february the company recorded a charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal year for reduction of goodwill and other long lived assets 
on september   the company announced that it had terminated its agreement with the nba to provide interactive content services 
the termination of this agreement led to the company s decision to exit the interactive media services market and focus on its enterprise information infrastructure software products 
following the termination of the nba contract and the company s change in focus  the company evaluated the recoverability of the intangible and other long lived assets including goodwill associated with the combination and associated with the nba agreement 
the intangible assets acquired in the combination  including developed technology  customer contracts and assembled workforce  were primarily related to the interactive media services offerings 
the assessment of recoverability was performed pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
additional guidance related to goodwill impairment was provided by apb  intangible assets 
the unamortized balance of intangible assets associated with the nba agreement was approximately million 
having no future economic benefit to the company  this unamortized balance was written down to zero 
as a result of the company s shift in focus  there were no future cash flows expected to be generated from the intangible assets acquired in the combination  thus  the unamortized balance of approximately million related to these intangible assets was also written down to zero 
since the assets acquired from intel were never integrated into the company s overall operations  the goodwill associated with the combination was evaluated for impairment along with the other intangible assets acquired from intel 
as a result  the unamortized goodwill balance of million was written down to zero 
in addition  there was an impairment charge of approximately million to reflect the fair value of certain computer equipment and furniture to be disposed of in connection with the closing of the facilities described above 
total expenses for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the change in the net loss per share  from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  was largely due to the reduction in goodwill and other long lived assets charge of million and the increase in amortization expense between the two fiscal years 
the change in the net loss per share  from per common share in fiscal year to per common share in fiscal year  was primarily due to the significant increase in amortization expense in fiscal year the total number of employees decreased to at january  from at january  the company had employees at january  other income  net other income increased to million for fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year other income was million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal years and was due to a higher level of invested funds resulting from the combination 
income tax benefit the income tax benefit of million for the year ended january  represents the reversal of the net deferred tax liability established as of january   primarily as a result of the combination with intel and the nba contract 
the company has net deferred tax assets of  as of january  given the company s inability to predict sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits of its net deferred tax asset as of january   the company provided a full valuation allowance against such deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources the company s combined balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at january  as compared to january  is summarized below in thousands 
january  january  change cash and cash equivalents    investments    total    as of january   the company s balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
the company believes that its current balance of cash  cash equivalents and its funds generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to fund the company s current projected cash needs for the foreseeable future 
prior to fiscal year  the company had primarily used cash provided by sales of its common stock to finance its operations 
if the actions taken by management are not effective in achieving profitable operating results  the company may be required to pursue additional external sources of financing in the future to support its operations and capital requirements 
there can be no assurances that external sources of financing will be available if required  or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
the company has the following contractual obligations associated with its lease commitments and other contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands and contractual obligations total beyond operating leases      other contractual obligations the number of days sales outstanding dso increased to days at january  from days at january  management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at january  is adequate

factors that may affect future results forward looking information the company s business environment is characterized by intense competition  rapid technological changes  changes in customer requirements and emerging new market segments 
consequently  to compete effectively  the company must make frequent new product introductions and enhancements while protecting its intellectual property  retain its key personnel and deploy sales and marketing resources to take advantage of new business opportunities 
future operating results will be affected by the ability of the company to maintain and grow demand for the company s products and services under uncertain domestic and international economic conditions  expand its product distribution channels and to manage the expected growth of the company 
future results may also be impacted by the effectiveness of the company in executing future acquisitions and integrating the operations of acquired companies with those of the company 
failure to meet any of these challenges could adversely affect future operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
in particular  the company s period to period operating results are significantly dependent upon the timing of the closing of license agreements 
in this regard  the purchase of the company s products can require a significant investment from a potential customer which the customer generally views as a discretionary cost that can be deferred or canceled due to budgetary or other business reasons and can involve long sales cycles of six months or more 
estimating future revenues is also difficult because the company ships its products soon after an order is received and  as such does not have a significant backlog 
thus  quarterly license fee revenues are heavily dependent upon a limited number of orders for large licenses received and shipped within the same quarter 
moreover  the company has generally recorded a significant portion of its total quarterly license fee revenues in the third month of a quarter  with a concentration of these revenues occurring in the last half of that third month 
this concentration of revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter 
the company expects these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future 
despite the uncertainties in its revenue patterns  the company s operating expenses are based upon anticipated revenue levels and such expenses are incurred on an approximately ratable basis throughout a quarter 
as a result  if expected revenues are deferred or otherwise not realized in a quarter for any reason  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected
