piccadilly is the dominant cafeteria chain in the southeastern and mid atlantic regions with cafeterias 
we serve a diverse and loyal customer base consisting of families  groups of friends and co workers  senior citizens  couples and students 
our patrons enjoy a wide selection of convenient  healthy  freshly prepared home cooked meals at value oriented prices for lunch and dinner 
we categorize our operating expenses into three major categories cost of sales  other operating expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
cost of sales consists of labor and food costs 
other operating expenses consist primarily of advertising  building and security costs  meal discounts  insurance  payroll taxes  repairs  supplies  utilities  cafeteria level performance incentives  depreciation  rent  and other cafeteria level expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of executive and regional manager salaries and related benefits and taxes  travel expenses  legal and professional fees  depreciation  amortization  and various other costs related to administrative functions 
forward looking statements statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be forward looking statements 
generally  forward looking statements contain terms such as expect  forecast  will  may  or believe 
forward looking statements regarding our present plans or expectations for credit facilities  cash flows  liquidity  pension accounting assumptions  capital expenditures  sales building and cost saving strategies  advertising expenditures  determinations of impairments of long lived assets  and the disposition of closed cafeterias and surplus properties involve risks and uncertainties relative to return expectations and related allocation of resources  and changing economic or competitive conditions  which could cause actual results to differ from present plans or expectations  and such differences could be material 
similarly  forward looking statements regarding our present expectations for operating results involve risks and uncertainties relative to these and other factors  such as the effectiveness of advertising  new product development  and the ability to achieve cost reductions  which also would cause actual results to differ from present plans 
such differences could be material 
we do not expect to update such forward looking statements continually as conditions change  and readers should consider that such statements speak only as the date hereof 
critical accounting policies and judgments we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the consolidated financial statements are based on the application of certain accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
certain of these policies require estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant  and equipment are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the following useful lives buildings and leasehold improvements lesser of lease life or years  furniture  fixtures and equipment four to ten years 
lease renewal option periods are included in determining leasehold improvement useful lives when  in our opinion  it is likely that we will exercise such renewal options 
our accounting policies regarding land  buildings  and equipment include judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets  the estimated residual values to which the assets are depreciated  and the determination as to what constitutes increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense that would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact the need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
in addition  the actual life of the asset and residual value may be different from the estimates used to prepare financial statements in prior periods 
impairment of long lived assets 
we determine impairment write downs as being necessary for cafeteria locations when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the total carrying value of that location s assets may not be recoverable 
recovery is measured by comparing the carrying value of the location s assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows that we expect such assets to generate 
assets are considered impaired to the extent that the asset carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow associated with such asset 
an impairment charge is recorded at an amount that is usually equal to the difference between the asset carrying value and the estimated present value of future net cash flows 
some of the assumptions that are used to estimate future net cash flow include guest traffic  average meal price  specific lease provisions such as rent escalation clauses  costs associated with the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  other operating expenses  and disposal value  if any 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
if material adverse changes in these factors occur  or if our assumptions used to estimate future net cash flow are materially incorrect  impairment charges may become necessary in the future  and such charges could be material 
goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective for fiscal sfas no 
requires that we analyze goodwill for impairment issues within the first six months of adopting sfas no we completed that evaluation and determined that no impairment charges were required 
as of july   goodwill is million or of total assets and of stockholders equity 
all of our goodwill resulted from the acquisition of morrison restaurants  inc in the morrison acquisition 
goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level  as required 
we consider individual cafeterias to be our reporting units 
all of the goodwill remaining at july   relates to seven cafeterias 
in assessing the recoverability of recorded goodwill we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill 
liabilities of ongoing obligations related to closed cafeterias 
we periodically review the historical operating cash flow and forecasts of future operating cash flow for each cafeteria 
forecasted cafeteria level cash flow is a primary determinant in whether the cafeteria will continue to operate or be closed 
for cafeterias which we decide to close prior to the expiration of its lease  we record charges in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity eitf 
eitf requires that such charges be recorded in the period in which we approve an exit plan that will result in the incurrence of costs that have no future economic benefit 
these charges typically relate to rent and other occupancy costs to be incurred after closing a cafeteria 
we then reduce these charges by our estimates of recoveries from subleasing activity  including an allowance for uncollected sublease income  or our estimates of reductions from negotiations with the landlord  if any 
the primary factors we consider when evaluating whether to include expected recoveries from subleasing activity are whether a sublease is under contract or if not  whether sufficient time remains under the lease contract for the property to be marketable 
we require a minimum of five years remaining under the lease contract to consider recoveries from potential subleasing activities in determining the net charge reflected in the financial statements 
if the actual results of our efforts to mitigate the ongoing obligations related to closed cafeterias are different from our estimates  a material adjustment to record additional liabilities or reduce recorded liabilities may be required 
at july   we have closed cafeteria locations with remaining lease obligations 
the estimated remaining obligations relating to these leases were million at july  we have entered sublease arrangements with respect to of these locations that offset of our remaining obligations and we have estimated that two leases without subtenants may be subleased in the future and further offset our remaining obligations by another million 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we periodically review the valuation allowance and adjust its amount  if necessary 
the factors used to assess whether such an adjustment is appropriate are our forecasts of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
at july   we have a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset 
liabilities for workers compensation and general liability claims 
we are subject to workers compensation and general liability claims and lawsuits 
to mitigate a portion of these risks  we maintain insurance for individual claims exceeding  an unrelated third party claims administrator using historical claims data  demographic factors  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions estimates losses relating to the self insured retention portion of known claims 
in addition  we estimate losses for unreported claims and the further development of known claims based on historical claims data 
the estimated losses could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claims trends 
while we monitor current claims closely and consider outcomes when estimating our insurance liabilities  the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes can affect our ability to make timely adjustments to the assumptions used in the estimates 
adjustments to these estimates could be material 
pension accounting 
we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
as of december   accrual of additional team member benefits under these plans was frozen 
the plans generally provide pension benefits that are based on an average of the team member s earnings and years of credited service 
our funding policy for the plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of  plus any additional amounts that we may determine appropriate 
we account for the defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a minimum liability is required to be established on the consolidated balance sheet to the extent of any unfunded accrued pension cost  which is the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets 
when it is necessary to establish a minimum pension liability  an equal amount  plus the carrying value of any related prepaid pension asset  is recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  in the consolidated balance sheet 
to determine whether a minimum pension liability is required under statement no 
 we must make certain assumptions 
first  we use a discount rate to calculate the present value of the accumulated benefit obligation 
in determining the discount rate  we consider rates of return on high quality fixed income investments 
at july   we determined this rate to be percent compared to percent used for fiscal second  we establish an assumption for the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets that is used to measure the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic pension cost for the upcoming year 
at july   we determined the rate for measuring fiscal net periodic pension cost to be percent  which is consistent with fiscal and fiscal if we experience a difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return  then the amount of that difference is deferred and is amortized into periodic pension expense income 
at july   our net balance sheet liability for accrued pension cost was million 
we did not contribute to the pension plans during fiscal and do not expect to contribute during fiscal for fiscal  we recognized pension expense of million  an increase from million in fiscal we currently expect pension expense for fiscal to be approximately million 
results of operations fiscal year end reporting period change effective april   we adopted a week fiscal reporting period effective for our fiscal year  resulting in a fiscal year end date of july   rather than june  prospectively  quarterly reporting will include week periods except for a week year in which the fourth quarter of that fiscal year will include weeks 
the change from a monthly reporting period to a week reporting period is consistent with our industry 
the inclusion of the two additional days for july   in the fiscal year just ended resulted in additional sales and net income for the fiscal year of approximately million and million  respectively 
we refer to the fiscal year ended july  as fiscal we refer to the fiscal years ended june  and as fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
total net sales for the fiscal  were million  a reduction from fiscal net sales of million 
fiscal sales include two additional days sales resulting from our adopting a week fiscal year reporting period see fiscal year end reporting period change above 
sales for these days were million 
cafeteria closings since july   accounted for million of the total decline in net sales 
the remaining decline of million is attributable to lower same store net sales 
the following table reconciles total cafeteria net sales to same store cafeteria net sales for the comparative fiscal years 
same store cafeterias are cafeterias that were open for twelve full periods in both fiscal years 
fiscal fiscal sales cafeterias sales cafeterias sales change dollars in thousands total cafeteria net sales less net sales for july  less net sales relating to cafeterias closed in fiscal cafeterias closed in fiscal net same store cafeteria sales the net decrease of reflects a decline in same store guest traffic of  which was partially offset by a check average increase of 
the check average increase is primarily due to a price increase implemented during the last week of december and various meal promotions during fiscal that were designed to enhance check average 
we have experienced sustained declines in same store guest traffic since we believe that the declines are due to various factors including intense competition and market saturation within the restaurant industry 
comparative same store sales by quarter for fiscal were    and  respectively for the first through fourth quarters 
after september   we experienced a steeper decline in our net same store sales 
we believe the steeper decline was attributable to lower traffic in regional shopping malls 
approximately one half of our cafeterias are located in regional shopping malls 
in november  we began a two month marketing and advertising campaign designed to increase guest traffic 
we believe the campaign was partially responsible for improving guest traffic trends to pre september levels by mid december 
in march we began a four month advertising campaign that included television and or radio advertising in markets covering approximately one half of our cafeterias 
all of our cafeteria markets were included in a related direct mail promotion 
comparative same store sales for april were down  while comparative same store sales for may and june were up and  respectively 
we believe that the most recent advertising campaign was partially responsible for improving the year over year sales comparisons for the fourth quarter  particularly for the last two months of the quarter 
the following table illustrates cost of sales  other operating expenses  general and administrative expenses  and other expenses income as a percent of net sales for the comparative fiscal years 
cafeteria level income 
cafeteria level income net sales less cost of sales and other operating expenses as a percent of net sales was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the reasons for this improvement in our margins are discussed below 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased 
that decline is a combination of a decrease in food costs as a percent of net sales and a decrease in labor costs as a percent of net sales 
the decrease in food costs  as a percent of net sales  is primarily due to the december price increase 
the improvement in labor costs  as a percent of net sales  is due primarily to savings realized from reduced labor hours combined with the december price increase 
on average  labor hours  primarily in the kitchen production area  are approximately hours per day per cafeteria lower than a year ago 
this reduction in labor hours is due to lower sales level  staff reductions  and scheduling efficiencies 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased as a percent of net sales 
rent expense increased as a percent of net sales primarily from the sale leaseback transactions completed in march and july team member benefits costs increased as a percent of net sales due to an increase in health claims costs and an increase in pension expense in the first six months of the fiscal year 
advertising expenses increased as a percent of net sales reflecting the sales building advertising campaigns introduced during fiscal these increases as a percent of sales were partially offset with savings from restructuring our team member health insurance program and freezing our defined benefit pension plan effective january  the team members that were formerly eligible for benefits under the defined benefit pension plan are now eligible for benefits in our k plan 
guest meal discounts declined after various sales promotions were eliminated 
utility costs decreased as a percent of net sales 
the impact of the two additional days in the current fiscal year improved other operating expenses as a percent of net sales by approximately million  or as a percent of net sales 
provision for cafeteria impairments and closings 
we recorded cafeteria impairment charges of million in fiscal we recorded a million charge related to closing a bradenton  florida cafeteria  where we exercised our right to exit the operating lease 
we recorded a million charge related to closing our durham  north carolina cafeteria  where the landlord exercised his right to terminate our lease 
in fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million related to the impairment of long lived assets and million for exit costs related to cafeterias that were scheduled to close see note for further information 
amortization and write off of goodwill 
of the cafeterias included in last year s impairment charges  were acquired in the morrison acquisition 
consequently  we recorded a million impairment charge against goodwill 
also during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million to write off goodwill associated with four morrison cafeterias closed in fiscal see note for further information 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses declined million and as a percent of net sales decreased 
in may  we initiated and completed a management reorganization plan that eliminated executive and district operations management positions 
included in fiscal general and administrative expense is million for severance costs 
substantially all of the million of severance costs was paid by june   with the remainder paid during the first quarter of fiscal excluding the effects of the million charge  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales for fiscal was  compared to for fiscal the decline is attributable to the ongoing benefits of the reorganization plan 
interest expense 
interest expense was down million compared to fiscal because debt levels are lower 
amortization of financing costs and original issue discount  included in interest expense  was lower in the fiscal by million 
other expense income 
other expense income includes interest income related to an irs refund discussed in note in the amount of million 
fiscal includes a gain on a sale of a piece of land in shawnee mission  kansas in the amount of million 
provision for income taxes 
on march   the job creation and worker assistance act of was enacted 
a provision of that act allows a five year carryback period for net operating losses for the tax year 
in march we filed a refund claim with the irs to carry back net operating losses to that resulted in a refund claim of million 
we subsequently received the refund in april because a valuation allowance had previously been established for these net operating losses  this refund resulted in an adjustment to the valuation allowance  which resulted in a tax benefit of million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
total net sales for fiscal were million  a reduction from fiscal net sales of million 
the million decline in cafeteria net sales was due to a million decrease relating to fewer cafeterias in operation and a decline of million in same store sales 
the following table reconciles total cafeteria sales to same store cafeteria sales cafeterias that were open for full months in both periods for fiscal and fiscal fiscal sales change sales cafeterias sales cafeterias dollars in thousands total cafeteria net sales less net sales relating to cafeterias opened in fiscal cafeterias closed in fiscal cafeterias closed in fiscal net same store cafeteria sales the decrease in same store net sales of million  or  reflects a decline in same store guest traffic of  which was partially offset by a check average increase of 
the check average increase resulted from a price increase implemented during the last week of december we have experienced sustained declines in same store guest traffic since we believe that the declining trend is due to various factors including intense competition and market saturation within the restaurant industry 
we implemented several sales building initiatives during fiscal to attract and retain new guests and increase sales to existing guests 
these sales building initiatives included neighborhood marketing  sponsorship of team member contests  and simplified menu pricing 
the neighborhood marketing strategies included various guest coupons and discounted meal alternatives to attract new guests 
while initial results did show improved sales trends  these results were not sustained and we terminated all sales building initiatives before the end of fiscal the following table illustrates cost of sales  other operating expenses  general and administrative expenses  and other expenses as a percent of net sales for the comparative periods fiscal fiscal change cost of sales other operating expenses general and administrative expenses other expenses income cafeteria level income 
cafeteria level income net sales less cost of sales and other operating expenses was million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percent of net sales declined 
that decline is a combination of a increase in food costs as a percent of net sales and a decrease in labor costs as a percent of net sales 
food costs as a percent of net sales increased primarily because of higher wholesale costs of red meat and produce 
we incurred  as anticipated  slightly higher food costs from an outsourcing program implemented during fiscal  which was designed to reduce overall labor costs 
the program involved using outside vendors who provided and prepared selected components of some piccadilly recipes  which historically we have made from scratch 
the food cost increases were partially offset by savings from our centralized purchasing initiative 
historically  we have centrally purchased approximately two thirds of the ingredients used in the meals served at the cafeterias 
managers at each cafeteria controlled purchasing for the remaining one third  primarily consisting of fresh poultry  fresh red meat  fresh produce  and dairy products 
we implemented a cost saving strategy to reduce the number of food suppliers by centralizing the purchasing of certain items 
during fiscal  we implemented a centralized purchasing program for poultry products  reducing our per cafeteria purchase cost by on average 
poultry accounts for approximately of our food purchases 
the improvement in labor costs  as a percent of net sales  was due principally to savings realized from the outsourcing program 
factors that offset the labor cost improvement as a percent of net sales include lower year over year sales volumes to offset the fixed portion of labor costs 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses decreased million  but increased as a percent of net sales 
discounting and coupon costs relating to sales building initiatives increased as a percent of net sales 
higher fuel prices caused utility costs as a percent of net sales to increase over the prior year 
additionally  the fixed portion of certain operating costs such as rent and repairs and maintenance increased as a percent of net sales as cafeteria net sales decreased 
provision for cafeteria impairments and closings 
during fiscal we recorded million of charges related to impairments of property  plant and equipment and lease related costs associated with closing cafeterias 
during fiscal  we determined that certain leases might not be renewed  and with respect to those cafeterias  revised our forecasts of undiscounted future operating cash flows accordingly 
primarily as a result of these revised forecasts  we determined that long lived assets for cafeterias  including cafeterias acquired in the purchase of morrison restaurants  inc morrison  were impaired in accordance with sfas no 
and we recorded asset impairment charges of million for property  plant and equipment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we decided to close non performing cafeterias because the cash flows from these cafeterias were not sufficient to contribute to lease related costs and on going operating costs 
accordingly  we recorded lease related costs of million and impairment of property  plant  and equipment charges of million 
these cafeterias were closed on july  thirteen of these cafeterias are leased and one cafeteria is company owned 
these cafeterias had operating losses of million in fiscal additionally  we closed eight cafeterias in fiscal and recorded charges of million for property  plant and equipment writedowns and lease related costs 
these cafeterias had trailing month operating losses of million 
amortization and writeoff of goodwill 
we recorded amortization and goodwill impairment charges of million 
recorded goodwill relates to the morrison acquisition 
approximately million of the charges recorded in fiscal relate to morrison cafeterias that were considered impaired and approximately million relates to morrison cafeterias that closed during the year 
net goodwill at june  was million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased 
included in current year general and administrative expense is million related to severance costs 
in may  we initiated and completed a management reorganization plan that eliminated executive and district operations management positions 
substantially all of the million of severance costs was paid by june  excluding the effects of the million charge  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales for fiscal was  down from fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased million because of higher interest rates on our credit facilities and amortization of deferred financing costs and bond discount 
amortization of these costs included in interest expense in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by lower average debt levels 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we considered that we had a cumulative pre tax loss for recent years and revised our judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance reflected our judgment that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
we believed that the remaining deferred tax assets at june   amounting to million  were realizable 
extraordinary charge 
we recorded a million charge for the early extinguishment of debt see note for further information 
we recorded no tax benefit related to the extraordinary charge 
other income 
other income in fiscal included income of million for the receipt of stock in an insurance company which had converted from a mutual company to a stock company  and through which we own whole life insurance policies 
liquidity and capital resources sale leaseback transaction 
on july   we completed a sale leaseback of six of our owned properties 
we received approximately million in cash for the sale of the properties and simultaneously executed long term leases to continue to operate cafeterias at the sites for a primary term of years and optional renewal periods for up to additional years 
we used substantially all of the net sale proceeds to purchase million in face amount of our senior secured notes due fiscal the net result of the sale leaseback and note repurchase transactions is a reduction of annual expense of million 
we recorded an extraordinary charge of approximately million to write off unamortized financing costs associated with the repurchased notes 
senior credit facility 
on december   we completed a three year  million senior credit facility with foothill capital corporation the senior credit facility replacing a million senior credit facility with commercial banks 
approximately million of the senior credit facility supports commercial letters of credit  and the remainder is available for working capital and for other corporate purposes see further discussion in trends and uncertainties below 
the senior credit facility matures in december we have no outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility at july  fiscal includes extraordinary charges of approximately million for the unamortized financing costs of the replaced facility 
the senior credit facility contains financial covenants that require i a minimum level of earnings before income taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda  ii a maximum ratio of the senior credit facility commitment to ebitda  iii a maximum ratio of net funded debt to ebitda  and iv a minimum ratio of fixed charges 
the financial covenant requirements are predetermined and adjust over the term of the senior credit facility 
we believe that the financial covenant requirements under the senior credit facility better suit our business plan than the covenants of the replaced facility 
currently  compliance with the financial covenants is measured quarterly 
however  if total funding under the senior credit facility together with outstanding letters of credit amounts to million  compliance with the financial covenants will be measured monthly 
at july   and with respect to the senior credit facility  we complied with all of the financial covenants  there were no fundings outstanding  and outstanding letters of credit amounted to million 
early retirement of debt 
on december   we used available cash balances to repurchase approximately million of face amount of our senior secured notes due fiscal approximately million of extraordinary charges were recorded to write off unamortized financing costs 
at july   we had outstanding million of our term a senior secured notes and million under our term loan credit facility 
the term b senior secured notes that were previously outstanding were retired in march we are required to dedicate a substantial amount of excess cash flow that we generate each year to make offers to repurchase the term a senior notes and amounts outstanding under the term loan credit facility  with excess cash flow being defined as ebitda less interest expense  income tax expense  and capital expenditures 
specifically  the term a senior secured notes and term loan credit facility require that  if during any fiscal year we have excess cash flow of more than million  we must make an offer the first excess cash flow offer to repurchase our term a senior secured notes and to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our term loan credit facility  in each case at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued interest 
the first excess cash flow offer must be in an amount equal to the lesser of million or the excess cash flow  and must be made ratably between the holders of the term a senior notes and the term loan credit facility 
in addition  we are required by the term loan credit facility to make a second offer the second excess cash flow offer if we have excess cash flow more than million during any fiscal year 
the second excess cash flow offer must be in an amount equal to by which our excess cash flow exceeds million  and must offer to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our term loan credit facility at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued interest 
both the first excess cash flow offer and second excess cash flow offer must be made on the last business day of september of each year 
for fiscal  we had excess cash flow of approximately million 
if our required excess cash flow offers are accepted in full by the noteholders and lenders  a total of approximately million will be applied to repurchase term a senior secured notes and prepay the term loan credit facility 
we have the ability to prepay this indebtedness by using cash balances on hand  cash generated by operations  and cash available under our senior credit facility 
we also expect to record charges for early retirement premiums of million and to write off unamortized financing costs of million 
rating agencies 
moody s and standard poor s s p initially assigned first time ratings of b and b  respectively  to our senior secured debt 
subsequently  moody s downgraded its rating from b to caa and s p downgraded its rating from b to b 
these ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
moody s assigns a caa credit rating to bonds it considers to be of poor quality and where it believes such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest 
s p assigns a b rating to obligations for which it considers that adverse business  financial  or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
a plus or minus sign is added to show relative standing with the major rating categories 
we express no opinion on the ratings assigned to the notes by moody s and s p and do not believe that these ratings downgrades will have a material adverse impact on our ability to repay the notes  our existing credit facilities  or our liquidity in the foreseeable future 
we have no credit facilities or commitments containing rating triggers 
dividends 
we have not paid a dividend on our common stock since the board suspended our regular quarterly dividend on february  our senior credit facility prohibits payment of dividends 
pension contributions 
in fiscal we recorded a minimum pension liability of million to reflect the unfunded liabilities of our defined benefit plans 
the pension plan liability will have no immediate cash impact 
if future earnings on plan assets do not recover to eliminate the under funding  we may be required to begin contributing to the pension plans beginning in fiscal or fiscal in the event that contributions are required  we expect that those contributions will be spread over several years 
we believe we will be able to absorb the cost of these contributions without materially affecting our liquidity or our ability to implement our business plan 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents at july   were million compared to million at june  capital expenditures for the year ended july   were million 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to approximate million 
we believe that our existing cash balances and cash from operations  together with the credit available under the senior credit facility  will provide sufficient liquidity to make any excess cash flow payments required under our term a senior notes and our term credit facility  and for our operational and capital expenditure needs through the term of the senior credit facility 
trends and uncertainties new york stock exchange listing 
in september  we submitted a plan to the new york stock exchange to demonstrate that we could meet the continued listing requirements of the nyse by february   a deadline established by the nyse 
with the minimum pension liability and corresponding reduction in shareholders equity recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal see note for further information  we have determined that we do not expect to meet the shareholders equity level targeted by the plan 
we continue to have dialogue with the nyse while evaluating the eligibility requirements to list our stock on other stock exchanges 
as of august   our per share stock price was  which does not meet the initial listing qualifications of the american stock exchange or the nasdaq 
pending accounting pronouncements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sales and also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas no 
as of july  we do not believe that the adoption of the statement will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
will require gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under sfas no 
we will adopt sfas no 
beginning july  upon adoption  losses on extinguishment of debt previously classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods will be reclassified to conform to the provisions of sfas no 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
will require that we recognize a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
under previous accounting principles  we recognized a liability for an exit cost at the date of our commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not believe that the adoption of the statement will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
minimum wage increase 
from time to time the united states congress considers increases to the federally mandated minimum wage 
historically  we have passed the cost of such increases to our guests in higher prices 
there can be no guarantee that future government mandated minimum wage increases could be absorbed into higher prices for our products 
we have estimated that the cost of a per hour increase in the federal minimum wage would increase our total wages and related payroll tax expenses by a range from million to million annually 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in short term interest rates related to our credit facilities 
if the variable rate on our million term loan credit facility were to increase by from the rate at july   for the entire fiscal period  then solely as a result of the increase in interest rates  our interest expense would increase  resulting in a  decrease in net income 
our senior secured notes bear interest at  subject to annual adjustment on november the interest rate is adjusted each year to plus for every million of ebitda for the preceding fiscal year in excess of million  not to exceed a increase in any one year  and not to exceed a rate of 
our ebitda for fiscal was million
