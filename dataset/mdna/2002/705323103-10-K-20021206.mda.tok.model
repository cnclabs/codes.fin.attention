item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the audited consolidated financial statements of the company included in this report 
recent developments during fiscal  the company continued to experience downward pressure on its operating margins 
the most notable factors included nurse shortages  selected reductions in pharmacy reimbursements  negative risk loss experience and select state medicaid program funding reductions 
the company has begun to implement process changes to try to improve operating margins which include continued implementation of the nurse scheduling system which  at september   brought the percentage of nursing locations on line to  temporary improvements in disposable and supply usage  increased revenue from existing start up locations with a corresponding reduction to their negative contribution margins  engagement of a consultant and commencement of negotiations with the company s largest state medicaid program to identify additional opportunities for the company s private duty nursing and ppec services that could provide the state with lower cost alternatives to existing care plans 
the company continues to focus on select key markets with unfulfilled market share potential 
the company s regional managed care sales personnel work directly with the branch office directors to increase local market share 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company opened three new start up locations  the eighth ppec location in augusta  georgia  which accepted its first patients in november  an hme location in san antonio  texas to complement the nursing start up which reached break even during the fourth quarter  and a diabetic supply location  based in pensacola  florida which initially will focus on the company s existing respiratory patients for follow on sales opportunities 
the company has refined its corporate incentive compensation and location bonus plans in its fiscal budget to properly align management s incentives with the creation of additional shareholder value 
operations management has the responsibility to implement the necessary process changes to achieve the budgeted results 
during the weeks ending september   the company experienced a slight decrease in total hours ordered and hours staffed and un staffed hours increased to approximately as compared to the prior rolling week period ending june  the company continues to aggressively compete for nurses to staff hours ordered 
to date  management has seen inconsistent results in a number of markets and will continue to evaluate wage and benefit levels in each local market and respond accordingly 
while management anticipates that as implementation of the new nurse scheduling system continues  improvements in both un staffed hours and gross margin levels should occur over time  but there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the following table represents the approximate total hours for the time periods indicated total hours ordered total hours declined total case hours staffed total case hours un staffed rolling weeks ended june  rolling weeks ended september  the company is aware of ongoing changes in the infusion drug delivery alternatives available to various payors 
if some of these alternatives are selected by various payors  there could be significant reductions to the company s future pharmacy revenues 
in addition  the company remains exposed to significant revenue fluctuations as a result of change in service or usage levels by a limited number of hemophilia factor patients 
the company is expanding its capability to distribute injectable medication nationally and continues to assess opportunities for these injectables in selected payor patient bases 
the company s marketing strategy is to capitalize on core product opportunities within these patient bases  as well as to expand product offerings 
to these ends  the company has approached select payors with a proposal for utilization of ppec centers in conjunction with its private duty nursing services in the company s present and potential markets 

table of contents the company has completed its annual renewal of its risk management program and implemented several changes 
due to the exiting by st 
paul fire and marine insurance company from the medical malpractice insurance marketplace  the company has entered into a new insurance program for medical malpractice  commercial and general liability coverage with arch specialty insurance company  rated a by am best company 
material changes included an increase in per claim deductible limits from  to  the annual aggregate also changed from  to no annual aggregate 
the policy amount remains at  with a slight increase in annual premiums 
however  the company chose to decline renewal of an additional  umbrella policy due to significant price increases 
the company s third party actuary has completed an analysis of the company s medical malpractice loss history and has quantified liability recognition for fiscal under the new policy terms 
under the new medical malpractice policy  if the company s experience worsens it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results and liquidity position 
in recognition of the increased exposure  the company has further re engineered its risk management processes 
among the changes is the formation of a committee which not only monitors incident reporting and claim adjustment activity  but also reviews existing patient census and discharges high risk cases where legally permissible 
the company continues to educate location staff on risk management procedures including appropriate nurse staffing decisions 
the company s management will continue to assess its various growth opportunities as articulated in its business development objectives  ranging from evaluation of acquisition alternatives  geographical expansion through the use of start up branch offices  marketing initiatives impact on existing branch office growth and technology improvements in order to ration capital available from operations 
the company operates in the health care industry which is subject to a variety of ever evolving set of risks and challenges 
these include but are not limited to nurse shortages  competitive bidding  hipaa regulations  potential average wholesale price awp reductions  adverse litigation  workers compensation losses  the availability and cost of medical malpractice insurance and reduced state funding levels of medicaid programs 
any changes arising out of or related to these risks and challenges could potentially have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
critical accounting policies net revenue due to the nature of the health care industry and the reimbursement environment in which the company operates  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will need to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods as additional information becomes available to management 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
as of september   the company had no material claims  disputes or unsettled matters with third party payors  nor were there any material pending settlements with third party payors 
net revenue represents the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for patient services rendered and products provided 
such revenue is recognized as the treatment plan is administered to the patient and recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with payors 
net revenues to be reimbursed by contracts with third party payors are recorded at an amount to be realized under these contractual arrangements 
revenues from medicaid and medicare are generally based on reimbursement of the reasonable direct and indirect costs of providing services to program participants 
in certain situations  the services and products are recorded separately 
in other situations  the services and products are billed and reimbursed on a per diem or contract basis whereby the insurance carrier pays the company one combined amount for treatment 
because the reimbursement arrangements in these situations are based on a per diem or contract amount  the company does not maintain records that provide a breakdown between the service and product components 

table of contents the company has developed a methodology to record the estimated revenue as a result of the inherent time lag between certain patient treatments and input of the related information into its billing and collection system 
this methodology measures relative changes in the time and overall activity level at each branch office location and aggregates these measurements to estimate the impact to consolidated net revenue 
as of september  the estimated revenue was approximately of revenue for fiscal year ended any unforeseen volatility to either the time or activity level at specific branch offices has the potential to significantly impact the estimate 
in other select cases  patient treatments may cease for a number of reasons including re hospitalizations  changes in treatment needs  or death  and a time lag may exist before this information is reflected in the company s billing and collection system 
the company has developed a methodology which measures the relative magnitude of these events over recent time periods and applies this methodology to reduce net revenues recognized in the current period 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining the adequacy of the allowance and related provision for doubtful accounts  the company has developed a process which combines statistical analysis of historical collection and write off activity with a detailed review of existing account balances meeting certain criteria and their likelihood of being collected at the amounts recorded 
this detailed review involves both the assigned corporate reimbursement department personnel and the respective branch office location personnel assessing each patient claim that falls within prescribed age and amount criteria 
these assessments are aggregated and compared to the results of the statistical analysis to provide additional support to management in making the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inherent in this estimate is the risk that it will need to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods  as additional information becomes available to management 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets as of october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
this standard eliminates goodwill amortization from the consolidated statements of operations and requires an evaluation of goodwill for impairment upon adoption of this standard  as well as subsequent evaluations on an annual basis  and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
for these evaluations  the company is using an implied fair value approach  which uses a discounted cash flow analysis and other valuation methodologies 
these evaluations use many assumptions and estimates in determining an impairment loss  including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings 
the company completed the impairment test and  at september   there was no resulting impairment 
subsequent impairments  if any  would be classified as as operating expense 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the transition provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  also became effective 
these transition provisions specify criteria for determining whether an acquired intangible asset should be recognized separately from goodwill 
intangible assets that meet certain criteria will qualify for recording on the consolidated balance sheet and will continue to be amortized in the consolidated statements of operations 
such intangible assets will be subject to a periodic impairment test based on estimated fair value 
accrued insurance the company s insurance broker retained the services of an independent actuary to prepare an actuarial analysis of the company s development of reported and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates are updated quarterly and are used in the valuation of the accrued insurance liability 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will need to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods  as additional information becomes available to management 
results of operations due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the company operates  certain estimates are required in recording net revenue 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that net revenue will have to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods as additional information becomes available to management

the company is  from time to time  subject to such suits arising in the ordinary course of business 
the company currently maintains professional and commercial liability insurance intended to cover such claims 
as of september   this insurance coverage is provided under a claims made policy which provides  subject to the terms and conditions of the policy  coverage for certain types of claims made against the company during the term of the policy and does not provide coverage for losses occurring during the terms of the policy for which a claim is made subsequent to the termination of the policy

management currently believes that its liquidity position will be adequate to satisfy the company s working capital requirements  professional and commercial liability insurance loss funding  selected potential acquisitions  funding of various business development plans  workers compensation collateral requirements  and income tax 
table of contents payments 
the company s current source of liquidity is cash on hand and cash flow from operations and as a result  the company is exposed to fluctuations in cash collection results 
however  the company has evaluated several senior debt proposals and believes that it could secure such financing if needed 
variation in quarterly operating results the company s quarterly results may vary significantly depending primarily on factors such as re hospitalizations of patients  the timing of new branch office openings and pricing pressures due to legislative and regulatory initiatives to contain health care costs

the company s new insurance carrier requires the twelve month estimated loss reserve to be funded entirely with cash over the first ten months of fiscal this cash requirement is estimated to be million  which is reduced by the monthly loss fund payments 
the new insurance carrier has the right to increase this cash requirement at the end of the first twelve months if the claim experience is greater than anticipated 
as a result of a field audit by a medicare intermediary  the company was notified of an asserted claim for recoupment of approximately million of accounts receivable 
the intermediary claimed that insufficient documentation was provided to substantiate the payments on accounts receivable 
historically  assertions of this type are settled in amounts significantly less than originally claimed

accordingly at september  the company is unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss  if any 
the company has entered into employment agreements with certain employees of the company which provide  among other things  salary  benefits and perquisites  as well as additional compensation for certain changes in control of the company or a failure of the company to comply with any material terms of the agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces a number of market risk exposures including risks related to cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and interest rates 
cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in one financial institution 
the company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of this financial institution 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable  which are primarily health care industry related  represent a risk to the company given the current environment in the health care industry 
the risk is somewhat limited due to the large number of payors including medicare and medicaid  insurance companies  individuals and the diversity of geographic locations in which the company operates 
however  the company has substantial geographic density in the southeast united states which it believes exposes the company to state initiated reimbursement changes 
the company s notes  issued in  have a fixed coupon rate of 
the fair value of the company s notes is subject to change as a result of changes in market prices or interest rates 
the company estimates potential changes in the fair value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments based on the hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates 
the company s use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account other factors such as the company s financial performance and credit ratings 

table of contents based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates at september  and  the market value of the company s notes would be reduced by approximately million and million  respectively 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a net increase in the market value of the company s notes outstanding at september  and of approximately million and million  respectively
