we also sold  shares of our class a common stock directly to univision at a price of per share 
the net proceeds to us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were approximately million 

table of contents also on august   we completed a reorganization from a limited liability company to a corporation 
as a result of this reorganization  prior to the closing of the ipo  the beneficial ownership of entravision was virtually identical to the beneficial ownership of entravision communications company  llc  our predecessor  immediately before the reorganization 
this reorganization occurred as follows walter ulloa  philip wilkinson and paul zevnik and each of their trusts and other related entities exchanged their direct and indirect ownership interests in our predecessor for newly issued shares of class b common stock  each of the stockholders in the seven corporate member entities of our predecessor other than messrs 
ulloa  wilkinson and zevnik and their trusts and related entities exchanged their shares in such corporate members for newly issued shares of class a common stock  each of the remaining individuals  trusts and other entities holding direct membership interests in our predecessor exchanged such interests for newly issued shares of class a common stock  and univision exchanged its subordinated note and option in our predecessor for shares of class c common stock

the notes bear interest at per year  payable semi annually on march and september of each year  commencing on september  the net proceeds from the notes were used to pay the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
we generate revenue from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations and advertising on our billboards and in our publication 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each media s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast  outdoor services are provided and publishing services are provided 
we incur commissions from agencies on local  regional and national advertising 
our revenue reflects deductions from gross revenue for commissions to these agencies 
our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staffs and our national representative firms  marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets 
the hispanic market opportunity our media assets target densely populated and fast growing hispanic markets in the us we operate media properties in of the highest density hispanic markets in the us in addition  among the top hispanic markets in the us  we operate media properties in of the fastest growing markets 
we believe that targeting the hispanic market will translate into strong growth for the foreseeable future for the following reasons hispanic population growth 
our audience consists primarily of hispanics  one of the fastest growing segments of the us population 
according to census data  over million hispanics live in the us  accounting for approximately of the total us population 
the overall hispanic population is growing at approximately seven times the rate of the non hispanic population in the us and is expected to grow to million of the total us population by approximately of the total future growth in the us population through is expected to come from the hispanic community 
by  hispanics are projected to be the largest minority group in the us spanish language use 
approximately of all hispanics in the us speak spanish at home 
this percentage is expected to remain relatively constant through the number of hispanics who speak spanish in the home is expected to grow from million in to million in we believe that the strong spanish language use among hispanics indicates that spanish language media will continue to be an important source of news  sports and entertainment for hispanics and an important vehicle for marketing and advertising 

table of contents increasing hispanic buying power 
the hispanic population in the us accounted for total consumer expenditures of approximately billion in  an increase of since hispanics are expected to account for over trillion in consumer expenditures by and by  hispanics are expected to account for trillion in consumer expenditures of total us consumer spending 
hispanic buying power is expected to grow at approximately five times the rate of the hispanic population growth by we believe that these factors make hispanics an attractive target audience for many major us advertisers 
attractive profile of hispanic consumers 
we believe that the demographic profile of the hispanic audience makes it attractive to advertisers 
we believe that the larger size and younger age of hispanic households averaging persons and years of age as compared to the general public s average of persons and years of age lead hispanics to spend more per household on many categories of goods and services 
although the average us hispanic household has less disposable income than the average us household  the average us hispanic household spends more per year than the average non hispanic us household on food at home  more on children s clothing  more on footwear and more on laundry and household cleaning products 
we expect hispanics to continue to account for a disproportionate share of growth in spending nationwide in many important consumer categories as the hispanic population and its disposable income continue to grow 
spanish language advertising 
according to published sources  nearly billion of total advertising expenditures in the us were placed in spanish language media in  of which approximately was placed in spanish language television and radio advertising 
we believe that major advertisers have found that spanish language media is a more cost effective means to target the growing hispanic audience than english language broadcast media 
business strategy we seek to increase our advertising revenue through the following strategies effectively use our networks and media brands 
we are the largest univision television affiliate group for univision s primary network as well as its new network  telefutura  which was launched in january univision s primary network is the most watched television network english or spanish language among us hispanic households  capturing approximately an market share of the us spanish language prime time audience as of december univision makes its networks spanish language programming available to our television stations hours a day  including a prime time schedule on its primary network of substantially all first run programming throughout the year

we use industry ratings and surveys  including nielsen  arbitron  the traffic audit bureau and the audit bureau of circulation  to provide a more accurate measure of consumers that we reach with our operations 
we believe that our focused research and sales efforts will enable us to continue to achieve significant revenue growth 
continue to benefit from strong management

television advertising local 
local advertising revenue is generated from commercial airtime and is sold directly by the station to an in market advertiser or its agency 
national 
national advertising revenue represents commercial time sold to a national advertiser within a specific market by univision  our national representative firm 
for these sales  univision is paid a commission on the net revenue from each sale gross revenue less agency commission 
we target the largest national spanish language advertisers that collectively purchase the greatest share of national advertisements through univision 
the univision representative works closely with each station s national sales manager 
this has enabled us to secure major national advertisers  including ford motor company  general motors  at t  mcdonald s  burger king and wells fargo bank 
we have a similar national advertising representative arrangement with telemundo 
xupn xetv are represented by blair television inc in  national advertising accounted for  local advertising accounted for and network and other compensation for of our total television advertising revenue 
network 
network compensation represents compensation for broadcasting network programming in two television markets 
television marketing audience research we derive our revenue primarily from selling advertising time 
the relative advertising rates charged by competing stations within a market depend primarily on four factors the station s ratings households or people viewing its programs as a percentage of total television households or people in the viewing area  audience share households or people viewing its programs as a percentage of households or people actually watching television at a specific time  the time of day the advertising will run  and the demographic qualities of a program s viewers primarily age and gender 
nielsen ratings provide advertisers with the industry accepted measure of television viewing 
in recent years  nielsen began a special service to measure hispanic viewing 
nielsen is now introducing improved methodology to its general market service that more accurately measures hispanic viewing by using language spoken in the home in its metered market sample 
we believe that this new methodology will result in substantial ratings gains and allow us to further increase our advertising rates and narrow any primary disparities which have historically existed between english language and spanish language advertising rates 
we have made significant investments in experienced sales managers and account executives and have provided our sales professionals with research tools to continue to attract major advertisers 
the various nielsen rating services that we use are described below nielsen hispanic station index 
this service measures hispanic household viewing at the local market level 
each sample also reflects the varying levels of language usage by hispanics in each market in order to 
table of contents more accurately reflect the hispanic household population in the relevant market 
nielsen hispanic station index only measures the audience viewing of hispanic households  that is  households where the head of the household is of hispanic descent or origin 
although this offers improvements over previous measurement indices  we believe that it still under reports the number of viewers watching entravision programming because we have viewers who do not live in hispanic households 
nielsen station index 
this service measures local station viewing of all households in a specific market 
we buy these reports in most of our markets to measure our viewing against both english and spanish language competitors 
this rating service  however  is not language stratified and generally under represents spanish speaking households 
as a result  we believe that this typically under reports viewing of spanish language television 
despite this limitation  the nielsen station index demonstrates that many of our full power broadcast stations achieve total market ratings that are fully comparable with their english language counterparts  with seven of our full power television stations ranking as the top station in their respective markets in prime time among viewers years of age 
television competition we compete for viewers and revenue with other spanish language and english language television stations and networks  including the four principal english language television networks  abc  cbs  nbc and fox  and in certain cities  upn and warner bros 
certain of these english language networks and others have begun producing spanish language programming and simulcasting certain programming in english and spanish 
several cable broadcasters have recently commenced  or announced their intention to commence  spanish language services as well 
telemundo is a competitor that broadcasts spanish language television programming 
as of december   telemundo had total coverage reaching approximately of all hispanic households in their markets 
in some of our markets  we compete directly with stations affiliated with telemundo 
we also compete for viewers and revenue with independent television stations  other video media  suppliers of cable television programs  direct broadcast systems  newspapers  magazines  radio and other forms of entertainment and advertising 
radio overview we own and or operate radio stations in markets  of which are located in the top hispanic markets in the us our radio stations cover in aggregate approximately of the hispanic population in the us our radio operations combine network programming with local time slots available for advertising  news  traffic  weather  promotions and community events 
this strategy allows us to provide quality programming with significantly lower costs of operations than we could otherwise deliver solely with independent programming 
radio programming radio network 
through our radio network  we have created one of the largest us hispanic radio markets  currently with approximately million potential listeners 
our network allows clients with national product distribution to deliver a uniform advertising message to the growing hispanic market around the country in an efficient manner and at a cost that is generally lower than our english language counterparts 
although our network has a broad reach across the us  technology allows our stations to offer the necessary local feel and to be responsive to local clients and community needs 
designated time slots are used for local advertising  news  traffic  weather  promotions and community events 
the audience gets the benefit of a national radio sound along with local content 
to further enhance this 
table of contents effect  our on air personalities frequently travel to participate in local promotional events 
for example  in selected key markets our on air personalities appear at special events and client locations 
we promote these events as remotes to bond the national personalities to local listeners 
furthermore  all of our stations can disconnect from the networks and operate independently in the case of a local emergency or a problem with the central satellite transmission 
radio formats 
we produce programming in a variety of music formats that are simultaneously distributed via satellite with a digital cd quality sound to our owned and or operated stations 
we offer three primary formats which appeal to different listener preferences radio romantica is an adult contemporary  romantic ballads current hits format  targeting primarily female hispanic listeners years of age

radio advertising substantially all of the revenue from our radio operations is derived from local  national and network advertising 
local 
this form of revenue refers to advertising usually purchased by a local client or agency directly from the station s sales force 
in  local radio revenue comprised approximately of our total radio revenue 
national 
this form of revenue refers to advertising purchased by a national client targeting a specific market 
usually this business is placed by a national advertising agency or media buying services and ordered through one of the offices of our national sales representative  lotus entravision reps llc lotus entravision 
lotus entravision is a joint venture we entered into in august with lotus hispanic reps corp 
lotus 
we believe that lotus brings significant national sales expertise and reach in targeting key hispanic media advertisers 
lotus entravision has increased our ability to capture national advertising sales 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced improved national sales every consecutive month of that quarter 
the national accounts are handled locally by the station s general sales manager and or national sales manager 
in  approximately of our total radio revenue was from national radio advertising 
network 
this form of revenue refers to advertising that is placed on one or all of our network formats 
this business is placed as a single order and is broadcast from the network s central location 
the network advertising can be placed by a local account executive that has a client in its market that wants national exposure 
network inventory can also be sold by corporate executives and or by our national representative 
in  network radio revenue accounted for approximately of our total radio revenue 

table of contents radio marketing audience research we believe that radio is an efficient means for advertisers to reach targeted demographic groups 
advertising rates charged by our radio stations are based primarily on the following factors the station s ability to attract listeners in a given market  the demand for available air time  the attractiveness of the demographic qualities of the listeners primarily age and purchasing power  the time of day that the advertising runs  the program s popularity with listeners  and the availability of alternative media in the market 
in the smaller and mid sized markets  spanish language radio continues to be more of a concept sale 
arbitron provides advertisers with the industry accepted measure of listening audience classified by demographic segment and time of day that the listeners spend on particular radio stations 
radio advertising rates generally are highest during the morning and afternoon drive time hours which are the peak times for radio audience listening 
we believe that having multiple stations in a market is desirable to enable us to provide alternatives and to command higher advertising rates and budget share 
historically  advertising rates for spanish language radio stations have been lower than those of english language stations with similar audience levels 
we believe that we will be able to increase our rates as new and existing advertisers recognize the growing desirability of targeting the hispanic population in the us each station broadcasts an optimal number of advertisements each hour  depending upon its format  in order to maximize the station s revenue without jeopardizing its audience listenership 
our owned stations have up to minutes per hour for commercial inventory and local content 
our network has up to two additional minutes of commercial inventory per hour 
the pricing is based on a rate card and negotiations subject to the supply and demand for the inventory in each particular market and the network 
radio competition radio broadcasting is a highly competitive business 
the financial success of each of our radio stations and markets depends in large part on our audience ratings  our ability to increase our market share of the overall radio advertising revenue and the economic health of the market 
in addition  our advertising revenue depends upon the desire of advertisers to reach our audience demographic 
each of our radio stations competes for audience share and advertising revenue directly with both spanish language and english language radio stations in its market  and with other media within their respective markets  such as newspapers  broadcast and cable television  magazines  billboard advertising  transit advertising and direct mail advertising 
our primary competitors in our markets in spanish language radio are hispanic broadcasting corporation  spanish broadcasting system  inc and radio unica communications corp 
several of the companies with which we compete are large national or regional companies that have significantly greater resources and longer operating histories than we do 
factors that are material to our competitive position include management experience  a station s rank in its market  signal strength and audience demographics 
if a competing station within a market converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations  or if one of our competitors upgrades its stations  we could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue in that market 
the audience ratings and advertising revenue of our individual stations are subject to fluctuation and any adverse change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the radio industry is subject to competition from new media technologies that are being developed or introduced  such as audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  
table of contents satellite digital audio service  which has resulted in the introduction of new satellite radio services with sound quality comparable to that of compact disks  and in band on channel digital radio  which could provide multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services 
outdoor advertising our outdoor advertising operations complement our television and radio businesses and allow for cross promotional opportunities 
because of its repetitive impact and relatively low cost  outdoor advertising attracts national  regional and local advertisers 
we offer the ability to target specific demographic groups on a cost effective basis as compared to other advertising media 
in addition  we provide businesses with advertising opportunities in locations near their stores or outlets 
our outdoor portfolio adds to our television and radio reach by providing local advertisers with significant coverage of the hispanic communities in los angeles  new york and fresno 
our outdoor advertising strategy is designed to complement our existing television and radio businesses by allowing us to capitalize on our hispanic market expertise 
the primary components of our strategy are to leverage the strengths of our inventory  continue to focus on ethnic communities and increase market penetration 
outdoor advertising markets we own and operate approximately  outdoor advertising faces located primarily in high density hispanic communities in los angeles and new york  the two largest hispanic markets in the us we also maintain the exclusive rights to market advertising on public buses in fresno  california 
we believe that our outdoor advertising appeals to both large and small businesses 
los angeles 
the greater los angeles market has a population of approximately million  of which million or are hispanic 
as such  los angeles ranks as the largest hispanic advertising market in the us substantially all of our billboard inventory in los angeles is located in neighborhoods where hispanics represent a significant percentage of the local population 
we believe that this coverage of the hispanic population will continue to increase as the hispanic community continues to grow 
the los angeles metropolitan area has miles of freeways and surface streets where the average commuter spends approximately minutes per day in the car 
new york 
the greater new york city area has a population of approximately million  of which approximately million or are hispanic 
as such  new york ranks as the second largest hispanic advertising market in the us we have consolidated substantially all of the sheet and sheet outdoor advertising faces in new york 
outdoor advertising inventory inventory type los angeles new york sheet posters sheet posters city lights wall scapes bulletins total 
table of contents our inventory consists of the following types of advertising faces that are typically located on sites that we have leased or have a permanent easement sheet posters are generally feet high by feet wide 
due to the smaller size of this type of billboard  sheet posters are often located in densely populated or fast growing areas where larger signs do not fit or are not permitted  such as parking lots and other tight areas 
accordingly  most of our sheet posters are concentrated on city streets  targeting both pedestrian and vehicular traffic and are sold to advertisers for periods of four weeks 
sheet posters are generally feet high by feet wide and are the most common type of billboard 
lithographed or silk screened paper sheets  supplied by the advertiser  are pre pasted and packaged in airtight bags by the outdoor advertising company and applied  like wallpaper  to the face of the display 
the sheet posters are concentrated on major traffic arteries and space is usually sold to advertisers for periods of four weeks 
city lights is a product we created in to serve national advertisers with a new advertising format visible both during the day and night 
the format is typically used by national fashion  entertainment and consumer products companies desiring to target consumers within proximity of local malls or retail outlets 
a city lights structure is approximately feet by feet set vertically on a single pole structure 
the advertisement is usually housed in an illuminated glass casing for greater visibility at night and is sold to advertisers for a period of four weeks 
wall scapes generally consist of advertisements ranging in a variety of sizes from to square feet which are displayed on the sides of buildings in densely populated locations 
advertising formats can include either vinyl prints or painted artwork 
because of a wall scape s greater impact and higher cost relative to other types of billboards  space is usually sold to advertisers for periods of six to months 
bulletins are generally feet high and feet wide and consist of panels or a single sheet of vinyl that are hand painted at the facilities of the outdoor advertising company or computer painted in accordance with design specifications supplied by the advertiser and mounted to the face of the display 
because of painted bulletins greater impact and higher cost relative to other types of billboards  they are usually located near major highways and are sold for periods of six to months 
transit advertising is our newest form of outdoor advertising inventory and consists of advertising panels placed directly on public city buses 
we market this type of advertising product only in fresno  california  where we maintain exclusive rights through a three year franchise arrangement to sell advertising space on all of fresno s public buses until january  significant acquisitions acquisition of z spanish media outdoor advertising assets 
through our acquisition of z spanish media  we acquired approximately  outdoor advertising assets located primarily in high density hispanic communities in new york city and los angeles 
acquisition of infinity broadcasting outdoor advertising assets 
on october   we acquired certain outdoor advertising assets located primarily in high density hispanic communities in new york city from infinity broadcasting corporation  or infinity  for approximately million 
outdoor advertising revenue advertisers usually contract for outdoor displays through advertising agencies  which are responsible for the artistic design and written content of the advertising 
advertising contracts are negotiated on the basis of monthly rates published in our rate card 
these rates are based on a particular display s exposure or number of 
table of contents impressions delivered in relation to the demographics of the particular market and its location within that market 
the number of impressions delivered by a display measured by the number of vehicles passing the site during a defined period and weighted to give effect to such factors as its proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic is determined by surveys that are verified by the traffic audit bureau  an independent agency which is the outdoor advertising industry s equivalent of television s nielsen ratings and radio s arbitron ratings 
in each of our markets  we employ salespeople who sell both local and national advertising 
our outdoor advertising revenue mix consisted of approximately national advertisers and local advertisers 
we believe that our local sales force is crucial to maintaining relationships with key advertisers and agencies and identifying new advertisers 
outdoor advertising competition we compete in each of our outdoor markets with other outdoor advertisers including infinity  clear channel  artkraft strauss  medallion financial corp 
and regency outdoor advertising 
many of these competitors have a larger national network and may have greater total resources than we have 
in addition  we also compete with a wide variety of out of home media  including advertising in shopping centers  airports  stadiums  movie theaters and supermarkets  as well as on taxis  trains and buses 
in competing with other media  outdoor advertising relies on its relative cost efficiency and its ability to reach a segment of the population with a particular set of demographic characteristics within that market 
publishing in connection with our acquisition of lcg in april  we acquired el diario la prensa  the oldest major spanish language daily newspaper in the us and one of only two spanish language daily newspapers in new york 
the newspaper reports news of interest to the hispanic community  focusing primarily on local news events and daily occurrences in latin america 
el diario la prensa has a daily paid circulation of approximately  as of september   up from approximately  as of september  the majority of el diario la prensa s revenue comes from circulation sales and the sale of local  national and classified advertising 
our top ten newspaper advertisers by dollar volume accounted for of el diario la prensa s total advertising revenue in circulation revenue comes almost exclusively from sales at newsstands and retail outlets  rather than mailed subscriptions 
our primary spanish language publishing competitor is a publication called hoy 
our publishing operation also competes with english language newspapers and other types of advertising media  many of which reach larger audiences and have greater total resources than we have 
most of our publishing employees are represented by the newspaper and mail deliverers union of new york and vicinity and the newspaper guild of new york 
our collective bargaining agreement with the newspaper guild of new york expires on june  and our agreement with the newspaper and mail deliverers union of new york and vicinity expires on march  material trademarks  trade names and service marks in the course of our business  we use various trademarks  trade names and service marks  including our logos  in our advertising and promotions 
we believe that the strength of our trademarks  trade names and service marks are important to our business and intend to protect and promote them as appropriate 
we do not hold or depend upon any material patent  government license  franchise or concession  except our broadcast licenses granted by the federal communications commission fcc 

table of contents employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees  including full time employees in television  full time employees in radio  full time employees in outdoor and full time employees in publishing 
as of december   of our publishing employees were represented by labor unions that have entered into collective bargaining agreements with us 
as of december   of our full time outdoor employees were represented by labor unions that have entered into or are currently in negotiations for collective bargaining agreements with us 
we believe our relations with our employees are good 
regulation of television and radio broadcasting general 
the fcc regulates television and radio broadcast stations pursuant to the communications act of the communications act 
among other things  the fcc determines the particular frequencies  locations and operating power of stations  issues  renews  revokes and modifies station licenses  regulates equipment used by stations  and adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership  changes in ownership  control  operation and employment practices of stations 
a licensee s failure to observe the requirements of the communications act or fcc rules and policies may result in the imposition of various sanctions  including admonishment  fines  the grant of renewal terms of less than eight years  the grant of a license with conditions or  in the case of particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application  the revocation of an fcc license or the denial of fcc consent to acquire additional broadcast properties 
congress and the fcc have had under consideration or reconsideration  and may in the future consider and adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could  directly or indirectly  affect the operation  ownership and profitability of our television and radio stations  result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our television and radio broadcast stations or affect our ability to acquire additional television and radio broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions 
such matters may include changes to the license authorization and renewal process  proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on fcc licensees  changes to the fcc s equal employment opportunity regulations and other matters relating to involvement of minorities and women in the broadcasting industry  proposals to change rules relating to political broadcasting including proposals to grant free air time to candidates  proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer  wine and other alcoholic beverages  technical and frequency allocation matters  including a new class a television service for existing low power television stations and a new low power fm radio broadcast service  the implementation of digital audio broadcasting on both satellite and terrestrial bases  the implementation of rules governing the transmission of local television signals by direct broadcast satellite services in their local areas  and requiring cable television and direct broadcast satellite to carry local television digital signals  changes in broadcast multiple ownership  foreign ownership  cross ownership and ownership attribution policies  and proposals to alter provisions of the tax laws affecting broadcast operations and acquisitions 

table of contents we cannot predict what changes  if any  might be adopted  nor can we predict what other matters might be considered in the future  nor can we judge in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any particular proposal or change might have on our business 
fcc licenses 
television and radio stations operate pursuant to licenses that are granted by the fcc for a term of eight years  subject to renewal upon application to the fcc 
during the periods when renewal applications are pending  petitions to deny license renewal applications may be filed by interested parties  including members of the public 
the fcc may hold hearings on renewal applications if it is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve the public interest  convenience and necessity  or if a petition to deny raises a substantial and material question of fact as to whether the grant of the renewal applications would be inconsistent with the public interest  convenience and necessity 
however  the fcc is prohibited from considering competing applications for a renewal applicant s frequency  and is required to grant the renewal application if it finds that the station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  that there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or the rules and regulations of the fcc  and that there have been no other violations by the licensee of the communications act or the rules and regulations of the fcc that  when taken together  would constitute a pattern of abuse 
if as a result of an evidentiary hearing  the fcc determines that the licensee has failed to meet the requirements for renewal and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction  the fcc may deny a license renewal application 
historically  fcc licenses have generally been renewed 
we have no reason to believe that our licenses will not be renewed in the ordinary course  although there can be no assurance to that effect 
the non renewal of one or more of our stations licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business 
ownership matters 
the communications act requires prior consent of the fcc for the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a corporation or other entity holding a license 
in determining whether to approve an assignment of a television or radio broadcast license or a transfer of control of a broadcast licensee  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties  the character of the licensee and those persons holding attributable interests therein  and the communications act s limitations on foreign ownership and compliance with the fcc rules and regulations 
to obtain the fcc s prior consent to assign or transfer a broadcast license  appropriate applications must be filed with the fcc 
if the application to assign or transfer the license involves a substantial change in ownership or control of the licensee  for example  the transfer or acquisition of more than of the voting equity  the application must be placed on public notice for a period of days during which petitions to deny the application may be filed by interested parties  including members of the public 
if an assignment application does not involve new parties  or if a transfer of control application does not involve a substantial change in ownership or control  it is a pro forma application  which is not subject to the public notice and day petition to deny procedure 
the regular and pro forma applications are nevertheless subject to informal objections that may be filed any time until the fcc acts on the application 
if the fcc grants an assignment or transfer application  interested parties have days from public notice of the grant to seek reconsideration of that grant 
the fcc has an additional ten days to set aside such grant on its own motion 
when ruling on an assignment or transfer application  the fcc is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment or transfer to any party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application 
under the communications act  a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by persons who are not us citizens  by any corporation that has more than of its capital stock owned or voted by non us citizens or entities or their representatives  by foreign governments or their representatives or by non us corporations 

table of contents furthermore  the communications act provides that no fcc broadcast license may be granted to or held by any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than of its capital stock is owned of record or voted by non us citizens or entities or their representatives  or foreign governments or their representatives or by non us corporations  if the fcc finds the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license 
thus  the licenses for our stations could be revoked if more than of our outstanding capital stock is issued to or for the benefit of non us citizens in excess of these limitations 
our first restated certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership and voting of our capital stock to comply with these requirements 
the fcc generally applies its other broadcast ownership limits to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation or other association or entity 
in the case of a corporation holding broadcast licenses  the interests of officers  directors and those who  directly or indirectly  have the right to vote or more of the stock of a licensee corporation are generally deemed attributable interests  as are positions as an officer or director of a corporate parent of a broadcast licensee 
stock interests held by insurance companies  mutual funds  bank trust departments and certain other passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only become attributable with the ownership of or more of the voting stock of the corporation holding broadcast licenses 
a time brokerage agreement with another television or radio station in the same market creates an attributable interest in the brokered television or radio station as well for purposes of the fcc s local television or radio station ownership rules  if the agreement affects more than of the brokered television or radio station s weekly broadcast hours 
debt instruments  non voting stock  options and warrants for voting stock that have not yet been exercised  insulated limited partnership interests where the limited partner is not materially involved in the media related activities of the partnership and minority voting stock interests in corporations where there is a single holder of more than of the outstanding voting stock whose vote is sufficient to affirmatively direct the affairs of the corporation generally do not subject their holders to attribution 
however  the fcc now applies a rule  known as the equity debt plus rule  that causes certain creditors or investors to be attributable owners of a station  regardless of whether there is a single majority stockholder or other applicable exception to the fcc s attribution rules 
under this new rule  a major programming supplier any programming supplier that provides more than of the station s weekly programming hours or a same market media entity will be an attributable owner of a station if the supplier or same market media entity holds debt or equity  or both  in the station that is greater than of the value of the station s total debt plus equity 
for purposes of the equity debt plus rule  equity includes all stock  whether voting or nonvoting  and equity held by insulated limited partners in limited partnerships 
debt includes all liabilities  whether long term or short term 
generally  the fcc only permits an owner to have one television station per market 
a single owner is permitted to have two stations with overlapping signals so long as they are assigned to different markets 
recent changes to the fcc s rules regarding ownership now permit an owner to operate two television stations assigned to the same market so long as either the television stations do not have overlapping broadcast signals  or there will remain after the transaction eight independently owned  full power noncommercial or commercial operating television stations in the market and one of the two commonly owned stations is not ranked in the top four based upon audience share 
the fcc will consider waiving these ownership restrictions in certain cases involving failing or failed stations or stations which are not yet built 

table of contents the fcc permits a television station owner to own one radio station in the same market as its television station 
in addition  a television station owner is permitted to own additional radio stations  not to exceed the local ownership limits for the market  as follows in markets where media voices will remain  an owner may own an additional five radio stations  or  if the owner only has one television station  an additional six radio stations  and in markets where ten media voices will remain  an owner may own an additional three radio stations 
a media voice includes each independently owned and operated full power television and radio station and each daily newspaper that has a circulation exceeding of the households in the market  plus one voice for all cable television systems operating in the market 
the fcc has eliminated the limitation on the number of radio stations a single individual or entity may own nationwide and increased the limits on the number of stations an entity or individual may own in a market as follows in a radio market with or more commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to eight commercial radio stations  not more than five of which are in the same service am or fm 
in a radio market with between and inclusive commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to seven commercial radio stations  not more than four of which are in the same service am or fm 
in a radio market with between and inclusive commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to six commercial radio stations  not more than four of which are in the same service am or fm 
in a radio market with or fewer commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to five commercial radio stations  not more than three of which are in the same service am or fm  except that a party may not own  operate  or control more than of the radio stations in such market 
the fcc has notified the public of its intention to review transactions that comply with these numerical ownership limits but that might involve undue concentration of market share 
the fcc has also solicited comments from the public on whether it should alter the way in which it defines radio markets for purposes of these rules 
because of these multiple and cross ownership rules  if a stockholder  officer or director of entravision holds an attributable interest in entravision  such stockholder  officer or director may violate the fcc s rules if such person or entity also holds or acquires an attributable interest in other television or radio stations or daily newspapers  depending on their number and location 
if an attributable stockholder  officer or director of entravision violates any of these ownership rules  we may be unable to obtain from the fcc one or more authorizations needed to conduct our broadcast business and may be unable to obtain fcc consents for certain future acquisitions 
recent court rulings have called into question the validity of the fcc s current ownership limitations involving local market and nationwide limitations and even the fcc s authority to impose such limits 
in addition  the fcc has announced that it is considering changes to or possible elimination of its ownership limit rules 
the various fcc proceedings and judicial review thereof are ongoing 
at this time it is difficult to predict the future of the fcc s restrictions on how many stations a party may own  operate and or control  and the effect that such changes may have upon our future acquisitions and competition we experience from other companies 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
the fcc has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a broadcast station s community of license 
nevertheless  a broadcast 
table of contents licensee continues to be required to present programming in response to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating its responsiveness 
the fcc will consider complaints from the public about a broadcast station s programming when it evaluates the licensee s renewal application  but complaints also may be filed and considered at any time 
stations also must follow various fcc rules that regulate  among other things  political broadcasting  the broadcast of obscene or indecent programming  sponsorship identification  the broadcast of contests and lotteries and technical operation 
the fcc requires that licensees must not discriminate in hiring practices 
the fcc rules also prohibit a broadcast licensee from simulcasting more than of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service that is  am am or fm fm 
the simulcasting restriction applies if the licensee owns both radio broadcast stations or owns one and programs the other through a local marketing agreement  provided that the contours of the radio stations overlap in a certain manner 
must carry rules 
fcc regulations implementing the cable television consumer protection and competition act of the cable act require each full service television broadcaster to elect  at three year intervals beginning october   to either require carriage of its signal by cable systems in the station s market  which is referred to as must carry rules  or negotiate the terms on which such broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the cable systems within its market which is referred to as retransmission consent 
we have elected must carry with respect to each of our full power stations 
under the fcc s rules currently in effect  cable systems are only required to carry one signal from each local broadcast television station 
as our systems begin broadcasting digital signals in  the cable systems that carry our stations analog signals will not be required to carry such digital signal until we discontinue our analog broadcasting 
also  under current fcc rules  the cable systems will be required to carry only one channel of digital signal from each of our stations  even though we may be capable of broadcasting multiple programs simultaneously within the bandwidth that the fcc has allotted to us for digital broadcasting 
time brokerage agreements 
we have  from time to time  entered into time brokerage agreements  generally in connection with pending station acquisitions  under which we are given the right to broker time on stations owned by third parties  or agree that other parties may broker time on our stations 
by using time brokerage agreements  we can provide programming and other services to a station proposed to be acquired before we receive all applicable fcc and other governmental approvals 
as indicated  we have  from time to time  entered into time brokerage agreements giving third parties the right to broker time on stations owned by us 
fcc rules and policies generally permit time brokerage agreements if the station licensee retains ultimate responsibility for and control of the applicable station 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to air all of our scheduled programming on a station with which we have time brokerage agreements or that we will receive the anticipated revenue from the sale of advertising for such programming 
stations may enter into cooperative arrangements known as joint sales agreements 
under the typical joint sales agreement  a station licensee obtains  for a fee  the right to sell substantially all of the commercial advertising on a separately owned and licensed station in the same market 
it also involves the provision by the selling party of certain sales  accounting and services to the station whose advertising is being sold 
unlike a time brokerage agreement  the typical joint sales agreement does not involve programming 
as part of its increased scrutiny of television and radio station acquisitions  the department of justice has stated publicly that it believes that time brokerage agreements and joint sales agreements could violate the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended  if such agreements take effect prior to the 
table of contents expiration of the waiting period under such act 
furthermore  the department of justice has noted that joint sales agreements may raise antitrust concerns under section of the sherman antitrust act and has challenged them in certain locations 
the department of justice also has stated publicly that it has established certain revenue and audience share concentration benchmarks with respect to television and radio station acquisitions  above which a transaction may receive additional antitrust scrutiny

digital television services 
the fcc has adopted rules for implementing digital television service in the us implementation of digital television will improve the technical quality of television signals and provide broadcasters the flexibility to offer new services  including high definition television and data broadcasting 
the fcc has established service rules and adopted a table of allotments for digital television 
under the table  certain eligible broadcasters with a full service television station are allocated a separate channel for digital television operation 
stations will be permitted to phase in their digital television operations over a period of years after which they will be required to surrender their license to broadcast the analog  or non digital television signal 
our stations must be on the air with a digital signal by may   and we have developed a plan for complying with this requirement 
we must return one of our paired channels for each station to the government by  except that this deadline may be extended until digital television receivers reach an market penetration 
equipment and other costs associated with the transition to digital television  including the necessity of temporary dual mode operations and the relocation of stations from one channel to another  will impose some near term financial costs on television stations providing the services 
the potential also exists for new sources of revenue to be derived from digital television 
we cannot predict the overall effect the transition to digital television might have on our business 
digital radio services 
the fcc currently is considering standards for evaluating  authorizing and implementing terrestrial digital audio broadcasting technology  including in band on channel technology for fm radio stations 
digital audio broadcasting s advantages over traditional analog broadcasting technology include improved sound quality and the ability to offer a greater variety of auxiliary services 
in band on channel technology would permit an fm station to transmit radio programming in both analog and digital formats  or in digital only formats  using the bandwidth that the radio station is currently licensed to use 
it is unclear what regulations the fcc will adopt regarding digital audio broadcasting or in band on channel technology and what effect such regulations would have on our business or the operations of our radio stations 
radio frequency radiation 
the fcc has adopted rules limiting human exposure to levels of radio frequency radiation 
these rules require applicants for renewal of broadcast licenses or modification of existing licenses to inform the fcc whether the applicant s broadcast facility would expose people or employees to excessive radio frequency radiation 
we believe that all of our stations are in compliance with the fcc s current rules regarding radio frequency radiation exposure 
satellite digital audio radio service 
the fcc has allocated spectrum to a new technology  satellite digital audio radio service  to deliver satellite based audio programming to a national or regional audience 
the nationwide reach of the satellite digital audio radio service could allow niche programming aimed at diverse communities that we are targeting 
two companies that hold licenses for authority to offer multiple channels of digital  satellite delivered radio could compete with conventional terrestrial radio broadcasting 
these competitors have commenced limited operations and both are expected to be offering their services nationwide by the end of low power radio broadcast service 
on january   the fcc adopted rules creating a new low power fm radio service 
the low power fm service consists of two classes of radio stations  with maximum power levels of either watts or watts 
the watt stations will reach an area with a radius of between one 
table of contents and two miles and the watt stations will reach an area with a radius of approximately three and one half miles 
the low power fm stations are required to protect other existing fm stations  as currently required of full powered fm stations 
the low power fm service will be exclusively non commercial 
it is difficult to predict what impact  if any  the new low power fm service will have on technical interference with our stations signals or competition for our stations audiences 
because of the legislation passed by congress in which protected incumbent radio broadcasters on frequency three channels away  we expect that low power fm service will cause little or no signal interference with our stations 
other pending fcc and legislative proceedings 
the satellite home viewer improvement act of shvia allows satellite carriers to deliver broadcast programming to subscribers who are unable to obtain television network programming over the air from local television stations 
congress in enacted legislation to amend the shvia to facilitate the ability of satellite carriers to provide subscribers with programming from local television stations 
any satellite company that has chosen to provide local into local service must provide subscribers with all of the local broadcast television signals that are assigned to the market and where television licensees ask to be carried on the satellite system 
we have taken advantage of this law to secure carriage of our full service stations in those markets where the satellite operators have implemented local into local service 
regulation of outdoor advertising outdoor advertising is subject to extensive governmental regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
federal law  principally the highway beautification act of the highway beautification act regulates outdoor advertising on federally aided primary and interstate highways 
as a condition to federal highway assistance  the highway beautification act requires states to restrict billboards on such highways to commercial and industrial areas and imposes certain additional size  spacing and other limitations 
all states have passed state billboard control statutes and regulations at least as restrictive as the federal requirements  including removal of any illegal signs on such highways at the owner s expense and without compensation 
we believe that the number of our billboards that may be subject to removal as illegal is immaterial 
no state in which we operate has banned billboards  but some have adopted standards more restrictive than the federal requirements 
municipal and county governments generally also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws 
some local governments prohibit construction of new billboards and some allow new construction only to replace existing structures  although most allow construction of billboards subject to restrictions on zones  size  spacing and height 
federal law does not require the removal of existing lawful billboards  but does require payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the removal of a lawful billboard along a federally aided primary or interstate highway 
state governments have purchased and removed legal billboards for beautification in the past  using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs  and may do so in the future 
governmental authorities from time to time use the power of eminent domain to remove billboards 
thus far  we have been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for any of our billboards purchased or removed as a result of governmental action  although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
local governments do not generally purchase billboards for beautification  but some have attempted to force the removal of legal but nonconforming billboards billboards which conformed with applicable zoning regulations when built but which do not conform to current zoning regulations after a period of years under a concept called amortization  by which the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation over time 
although there is some question as to the legality of amortization under federal and many state laws  amortization has been upheld in some instances 
we generally have been successful in negotiating settlements with municipalities for billboards required to be removed 
restrictive regulations also limit our ability to rebuild or replace nonconforming billboards 
in addition  we are unable to predict what additional regulations may be imposed on outdoor advertising in the future 
the outdoor advertising industry is heavily regulated and at various times and in various markets can be expected to be subject to varying degrees of regulatory pressure affecting the operation of advertising displays 

table of contents under the terms of a settlement agreement among us tobacco companies and states  tobacco companies discontinued all advertising on billboards and buses in the participating states as of april  the remaining four states had already reached separate settlements with the tobacco industry 
we removed all tobacco billboards and advertising in these states in compliance with the settlement deadlines 
in addition to the above settlement agreements  state and local governments are also considering regulating the outdoor advertising of alcohol products 
alcohol related advertising represented approximately of the total revenue of our outdoor billboard business in as a matter of both company policy and industry practice on a voluntary basis  we do not post any alcohol advertisements within a square foot radius of any school  church or hospital 
any significant reduction in alcohol related advertising due to content related restrictions could cause a reduction in our direct revenue from such advertisements and a simultaneous increase in the available space on the existing inventory of billboards in the outdoor advertising industry 
seasonality seasonal net broadcast revenue fluctuations are common in the television and radio broadcasting industry and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
our first fiscal quarter generally produces the lowest net broadcast revenue for the year 
risk factors risks related to our business we have a history of losses that if continued into the future could adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to raise capital 
we had net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  we had pro forma net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and net losses applicable to common stock of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that losses may continue while we pursue our acquisition strategy 
if we cannot generate profits in the future  it could adversely affect the market price of our securities  which in turn could adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity capital or to incur additional debt 
cancellations or reductions of advertising could adversely affect our results of operations 
in the competitive broadcasting industry  the success of each of our television and radio stations is primarily dependent upon its share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
although we believe that each of our stations can compete effectively in its broadcast area  we cannot be sure that any of our stations can maintain or increase its current audience ratings or market share  or that advertisers will not decrease the amount they spend on advertising 
our advertising revenue may suffer if any of our stations cannot maintain its audience ratings or market share 
shifts in population  demographics  audience tastes and other factors beyond our control could cause us to lose market share 
our stations also compete for audiences and advertising revenue directly with other television and radio stations  and some of the owners of those competing stations have greater resources than we do 
if a competing station converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations  or if one of our competitors strengthens its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue 
additionally  we believe that advertising is a discretionary business expense  meaning that spending on advertising may decline during an economic recession or downturn 
consequently  a recession or downturn in the 
table of contents us economy or the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate stations could adversely affect our advertising revenue and  therefore  our results of operations 
we do not obtain long term commitments from our advertisers  and advertisers may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalty 
cancellations  reductions or delays in purchases of advertising could adversely affect our revenue  especially if we are unable to replace such purchases 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expected future revenue and are relatively fixed once set 
therefore  unforeseen fluctuations in advertising sales could adversely impact our operating results 
our growth depends on successfully executing our acquisition strategy 
one of our strategies is to supplement our internal growth by acquiring media properties that complement or augment our existing markets 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  significant demands on our management  working capital and financial resources 
we may be unable to identify or complete acquisitions for many reasons  including competition among buyers  the need for regulatory approvals  including fcc and antitrust approvals  the high valuations of media properties  and we may be required to raise additional financing and our ability to do so is limited by the terms of our debt instruments  which may prevent future acquisitions and have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow through acquisitions 
in addition  we experienced significant growth during  primarily due to our acquisitions 
therefore  we do not expect to experience the same rate of growth in if we cannot successfully integrate our recent and future acquisitions  it could decrease our revenue and or increase our costs 
to integrate our recent and future acquisitions  we may need to integrate and improve operations and systems and the management of a station or group of stations  retain key management and personnel of acquired properties  successfully merge corporate cultures and business processes  realize sales efficiencies and cost reduction benefits  and operate successfully in markets in which we may have little or no prior experience 
future acquisitions by us could result in the following consequences dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  other acquisition related expenses  and acquired stations may not increase our broadcast cash flow or yield other anticipated benefits 
in addition  after we have completed an acquisition  our management must be able to assume significantly greater responsibilities  and this in turn may cause them to divert their attention from our existing operations 
we 
table of contents believe that these challenges are more pronounced when we enter new markets rather than expand further in existing markets 
if we are unable to completely integrate into our business the operations of the properties that we have recently acquired or that we may acquire in the future  our revenue could decrease and or our costs could increase 
in addition  in the event that the operations of a new station do not meet our expectations  we may restructure or write off the value of some portion of the assets of the new station 
if we cannot raise required capital  we may have to curtail existing operations and our future growth through acquisitions 
we may require significant additional capital for future acquisitions and general working capital needs 
if our cash flow and existing working capital are not sufficient to fund future acquisitions and our general working capital requirements and debt service  we will have to raise additional funds by selling equity  refinancing some or all of our existing debt or selling assets or subsidiaries 
none of these alternatives for raising additional funds may be available on acceptable terms to us or in amounts sufficient for us to meet our requirements 
our failure to obtain any required new financing may prevent future acquisitions and have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow through acquisitions 
our substantial level of debt could limit our ability to grow and compete 
as of december   we had approximately million of debt outstanding under our bank credit facility 
additionally  on march   we issued the notes  the proceeds of which were used to repay all of our outstanding debt under our bank credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
we expect to obtain a portion of our required capital through debt financing that bears or is likely to bear interest at a variable rate  subjecting us to interest rate risk 
a significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to servicing our debt obligations and our ability to obtain additional financing may be limited 
we may not have sufficient future cash flow to meet our debt payments  or we may not be able to refinance any of our debt at maturity 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to our lenders as collateral 
our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to repay outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations 
if the amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility are accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to such lenders 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our bank credit facility and the notes 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business 
for example  it could limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy or other purposes  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and our industry that could make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  and place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
any of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect us 

table of contents to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to pay the principal of and interest on the notes  to service our other debt and to finance indebtedness when necessary depends on our financial and operating performance  each of which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business  legislative and regulatory factors and other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations  including the notes 
if we are unable to pay our debts  we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional debt or equity securities 
in addition  the ability to borrow funds under our bank credit facility in the future will depend on our meeting the financial covenants in the agreements governing this facility  including a minimum interest coverage test and a maximum leverage ratio test 
there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our bank credit facility  in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
however  there can be no assurance that any alternative strategies will be feasible at the time or prove adequate 
also  some alternative strategies will require the consent of our lenders before we engage in those strategies 
the indenture for the notes and the credit agreement governing our bank credit facility contain various covenants that limit our management s discretion in the operations of our business 
the indenture governing the notes and the credit agreement governing our bank credit facility contain various provisions that limit our ability to incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and other restricted payments  create liens  sell assets  and enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
these restrictions on our management s ability to operate our business in accordance with its discretion could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our bank credit facility requires that we maintain specific financial ratios 
events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet those financial ratios  and there can be no assurance that we will meet them 
if we default under any financing agreements  our lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed to be immediately due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and or terminate their commitments  if any  to make further extensions of credit 
our bank facility and the indenture under which we issued the notes also require us to maintain specific financial ratios 
a breach of any of the covenants contained in our bank credit facility or the indenture could allow our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
if we are unable to pay our obligations to our senior secured lenders  they could proceed against any or all of the collateral securing our indebtedness to them 
the collateral under our bank credit facility consists of 
table of contents substantially all of our existing assets 
in addition  a breach of certain of these restrictions or covenants  or an acceleration by our senior secured lenders of our obligations to them  would cause a default under the notes 
we may not have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make accelerated payments  including payments on the notes  or to repay the notes in full after we pay our senior secured lenders to the extent of their collateral 
univision has significant influence over our business 
univision  as the holder of all of our class c common stock  has significant influence over material decisions relating to our business  including the right to elect two of our directors  and the right to approve material decisions involving our company  including any merger  consolidation or other business combination  any dissolution of our company and any transfer of the fcc licenses for any of our univision affiliated television stations 
univision s ownership interest may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of our company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible to complete without its support 
our television ratings and revenue could decline significantly if our relationship with univision or if univision s success changes in an adverse manner 
if our relationship with univision changes in an adverse manner  or if univision s success diminishes  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate television advertising revenue on which our television business depends 
univision s ratings might decline or univision might not continue to provide programming  marketing  available advertising time and other support to its affiliates on the same basis as currently provided 
additionally  by aligning ourselves closely with univision  we might forego other opportunities that could diversify our television programming and avoid dependence on univision s television networks 
univision s relationships with grupo televisa  sa de sa and corporacion venezolana de television  ca  or venevision  are important to univision s  and consequently our  continued success 
our ongoing success is dependent upon the continued availability of certain key employees 
we are dependent in our operations on the continued availability of the services of our employees  many of whom are individually key to our current and future success  and the availability of new employees to implement our company s growth plans 
in particular  we are dependent upon the services of walter ulloa  our chairman and chief executive officer  and philip wilkinson  our president and chief operating officer 
in august  we entered into five year employment agreements with messrs 
ulloa and wilkinson 
the market for skilled employees is highly competitive  especially for employees in technical fields 
while our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for us to be successful  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number to execute our plans  nor can there be any assurances that we will be able to continue to attract new employees as required 
our officers and directors and stockholders affiliated with them own a large percentage of our voting stock 
as of december   messrs 
ulloa and wilkinson  and paul zevnik  our secretary  own all of the shares of our class b common stock  and have approximately of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock 
the holders of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on any matter subject to a vote of the stockholders 
accordingly  messrs 
ulloa  wilkinson and zevnik have the ability to elect each of the remaining members of our board of directors  other than the two members of our board of directors appointed by univision  and have control of all aspects of our business and future direction 
messrs 
ulloa  wilkinson and zevnik have agreed contractually to elect themselves and a representative of tsg capital fund iii  lp as directors of our company 
this control may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of our company  such as a merger or sale of our company 
consequently  our directors and executive officers  acting in concert  have the ability to significantly affect the election of our directors and have a significant effect on the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
such concentration may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company 

table of contents risks associated with terrorism 
in the event of a terrorist attack on our facilities and properties  we do not believe that we would be vulnerable to significant or prolonged disruptions in our ability to broadcast or provide other media services 
we do not believe that  but we do not know whether  our network television programming would be vulnerable to significant or prolonged disruptions in the event of a terrorist attack 
the effect of any resulting decline in our revenue cannot be determined 
risks related to the television  radio  outdoor advertising and publishing industries our television and radio stations could be adversely affected by changes in the advertising market or a recession in the broader us economy 
revenue generated by our television and radio stations depends upon the sale of advertising and is  therefore  subject to various factors that influence the advertising market for the broadcasting industry as a whole  including changes in the financial condition of advertisers  which may reduce their advertising budgets  changes in the tax laws applicable to advertisers  and changes in the laws governing political advertising 
we cannot predict which  if any  of these or other factors might have a significant impact on the advertising revenue of the broadcasting industry in the future  nor can we predict what specific impact  if any  the occurrence of these or other events might have on our operations 
generally  advertising expenditures tend to decline during an economic recession or downturn 
consequently  our television and radio station revenue is likely to be adversely affected by a recession or downturn in the us economy or other events or circumstances that adversely affect advertising activity 
our operating results in individual geographic markets also could be adversely affected by local regional economic downturns 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and result primarily from fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local retailers and candidates for political office 
campaign finance reform legislation may restrict the amounts of money that we earn from political campaign and issue advertising 
if we are unable to maintain our fcc license for any station  we would have to cease operations at that station 
the success of our television and radio operations depends  in part  on acquiring and maintaining broadcast licenses issued by the fcc  which are typically issued for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal 
our fcc licenses are next subject to renewal at various times between october  and december  renewal applications submitted by us may not be approved  and the fcc may impose conditions or qualifications that could restrict our television and radio operations 
in addition  third parties may challenge our renewal applications 
if the fcc were to issue an order denying a license renewal application or revoking a license  we would be required to cease operating the broadcast station covered by the license 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our failure to maintain our fcc broadcast licenses could cause a default under our bank credit facility and cause an acceleration of our indebtedness 
our bank credit facility requires us to maintain our fcc licenses 
if the fcc were to revoke any of our material licenses  our lender could declare all amounts outstanding under the bank credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
if our indebtedness is accelerated  we may not have sufficient funds to pay the amounts owed 

table of contents displacement of any of our low power television stations could cause our ratings and revenue for any such station to decrease 
a significant portion of our television stations are licensed by the fcc for low power service only 
our low power television stations operate with far less power and coverage than our full service stations 
the fcc rules under which we operate provide that low power television stations are treated as a secondary service 
in the event that our stations would cause interference to full power stations  we are required to eliminate the interference or terminate service 
as a result of the fcc s initiation of digital television service and actions by congress to reclaim broadcast spectrum  channels previously used for broadcasting will be cleared and put up for auction generally to wireless services or assignment to public safety services 
the result is that in a few urban markets where we operate  including washington  dc and san diego  there are a limited number of alternative channels to which our low power television stations can migrate as they are displaced by full power broadcasters and non broadcast services 
if we are unable to move our signals to replacement channels  we may be unable to maintain the same level of service  which could harm our ratings and advertising revenue or  in the worst case  cause us to discontinue operations at those low power television stations 
the required conversion to digital television may impose significant costs which might not be balanced by consumer demand and we may have difficulty meeting certain fcc deadlines 
the fcc requires us full service television stations to begin broadcasting a digital television dtv signal by may  the fcc has allocated an additional television channel to most such station owners so that each full service television station can broadcast a dtv signal on the additional channel while continuing to broadcast an analog signal on the station s original channel 
as part of the transition from analog to dtv  full service television station owners may be required to stop broadcasting analog signals and relinquish their analog channels to the fcc by if the market penetration of dtv receivers reaches certain levels by that time 
our cost to construct dtv facilities and broadcast both digital and analog signals for our full service television stations between and will be significant 
certain of our full service television stations will not meet the may  deadline to begin broadcasting a dtv signal 
in certain cases  the inability to meet the deadline results from the fcc having not yet granted construction permits authorizing us to build the facilities necessary to operate on our allocated dtv channels 
certain other of our other full service television stations have received construction permits from the fcc  but may not be able to finish construction and begin broadcasting dtv signals before the may  deadline 
the fcc recently released rules which allow us to request an extension of time beyond may  to complete construction of our dtv facilities 
in case circumstances prevent us from meeting the may  deadline  we are in the process of seeking extensions of time from the fcc for our full service television stations that have received construction permits 
we are unsure what effect  if any  the possible refusal of the fcc to grant one or more of such extensions may have on our current analog or future digital operations 
additionally  the fcc recently released rules which allow us to initially satisfy the obligation to begin broadcasting a dtv signal by broadcasting a signal that serves  at least  each full service television station s applicable community of license 
in most instances  this new rule will permit us to temporarily install facilities of a lower power level  which will not require the initial degree of capital investment we had anticipated to meet the requirements of our stations dtv authorizations 
our initial cost of converting the qualifying television stations to dtv  therefore  will be considerably lower than it would have been if we were required to initially operate at the full signal strength provided for by our dtv authorizations 
we intend to explore the most effective use of digital broadcast technology for each of our stations 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will derive commercial benefits from the development of our digital broadcasting capacity 
although we believe that proposed alternative and supplemental uses of our analog and digital spectrum will continue to grow in number  the viability and success of each proposed alternative or supplemental use of spectrum involves a number of contingencies and uncertainties 
we cannot predict what future actions the fcc or congress may take with respect to regulatory control of these activities or what effect 
table of contents these actions would have on us 
our final costs to convert our television stations to full service dtv could be significant  and there may not be sufficient consumer demand for dtv services to recover our investment in dtv facilities 
changes in the rules and regulations of the fcc could result in increased competition for our broadcast stations that could lead to increased competition in our markets 
recent and prospective actions by the fcc could cause us to face increased competition in the future 
the changes include relaxation of restrictions on the participation by regional telephone operating companies in cable television and other direct to home audio and video technologies  the establishment of a class a television service for low power stations that makes such stations primary stations and gives them protection against full service stations  procedures for licensing low power fm radio stations that will be designed to serve small localized areas and niche audiences  permission for direct broadcast satellite television to provide the programming of traditional over the air stations  including local and out of market network stations  and elimination or revision of restrictions on cross ownership ie ownership of both television and radio stations in combination with newspapers and or cable television systems in the same market and caps on the number of stations or market share that a particular company may own or control  locally or nationally 
because our full service television stations rely on must carry rights to obtain cable carriage  new laws or regulations that eliminate or limit the scope of our cable carriage rights could have a material adverse impact on our television operations 
pursuant to the must carry provisions of the cable act  a broadcaster may demand carriage on a specific channel on cable systems within its market 
however  the future of those must carry rights is uncertain  especially as they relate to the extent of carriage of dtv stations 
the current fcc rules relate only to the carriage of analog television signals 
it is not certain what  if any  must carry rights television stations will have after they make the transition to dtv 
new laws or regulations that eliminate or limit the scope of our cable carriage rights could have a material adverse impact on our television operations 
our low power television stations do not have cable must carry rights 
in seven markets where we currently hold only a low power license we may face future uncertainty with respect to the availability of cable carriage for our stations in those markets 
with the exception of the san angelo  texas market  all of our low power stations reach a substantial portion of the hispanic cable households in their respective markets with their over the air broadcasts 
under the cable act  each broadcast station is required to elect  every three years  to exercise the right to either require cable television system operators in their local market to carry their signals  which we refer to as must carry rights  or to prohibit cable carriage or condition it upon payment of a fee or other consideration 
by electing the must carry rights  a broadcaster can demand carriage on a specified channel on cable systems within its market 
these must carry rights are not absolute  and under some circumstances  a cable system may decline to carry a given station 
our television stations elected must carry on local cable systems for the three year election period which commenced january  the required election date for the next three year election period commencing january  will be october  if the law were changed to eliminate or materially alter must carry rights  our business could be adversely affected 

table of contents the fcc is developing rules to govern the obligations of cable television systems to carry local television stations during and following the transition from analog to dtv broadcasting 
we cannot predict what final rules the fcc ultimately will adopt or what effect those rules will have on our business 
the policies of direct broadcast satellite companies may make it more difficult for their customers to receive our local broadcast station signals 
shvia allows direct broadcast satellite dbs television companies currently directv and echostar dish network for the first time to transmit local broadcast television station signals back to their subscribers in local markets 
in exchange for this privilege  however  shvia requires that in television markets in which a dbs company elects to pick up and retransmit any local broadcast station signals  the dbs provider must also offer to its subscribers signals from all other qualified local broadcast television stations in that market 
this is known as the carry one carry all rule 
our broadcast television stations in markets for which dbs operators have elected to carry local stations have sought to qualify for carriage under this rule  which we expect will increase our viewership in those markets 
the two dbs operators and a satellite broadcasting trade association have instituted litigation challenging the constitutionality of shvia s carry one carry all requirements 
in june a federal district court upheld the constitutionality of the federal law  which decision was upheld on appeal 
we cannot predict the final outcome of such litigation challenging the constitutionality of the carry one carry all rule 
a problem has also arisen in the manner in which one of the dbs operators has implemented the carry one carry all rule 
in order to get signals from all local stations  including the signals from our stations  echostar dish network subscribers are being required to install a second receiving dish to receive all of the local stations 
this is an inconvenience for the typical dbs subscriber and  as a result  limits the size of the viewership for our stations available only on the second dish under the carry one carry all rule 
there is a proceeding pending at the fcc to determine if dbs operators  in carrying out their shvia obligations  can require use of a second dish for carriage of local signals 
we may have difficulty obtaining regulatory approval for acquisitions in our existing markets and  potentially  new markets 
an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional television and radio stations 
the agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws  the federal trade commission ftc and the department of justice  may investigate certain acquisitions 
after the passage of the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act  the department of justice became more aggressive in reviewing proposed acquisitions of radio stations 
the department of justice has  on several occasions  negotiated settlements  without initiating litigation  with broadcasters seeking to increase their ownership of radio stations in specific markets  in which the broadcasters have been required to divest one or more stations in order to complete a transaction 
the department of justice has  in certain cases  examined television and radio ownership concentrations where a transaction would result in a single entity controlling more than of the advertising revenue in a particular market or where  after the transaction  two companies would control more than of the advertising revenue in a particular market 
the department of justice has also in certain cases examined whether a combination would result in undue concentration in a particular format or in formats appealing to particular audience demographics 
we cannot predict the outcome of any specific department of justice or ftc investigation 
any decision by the department of justice or ftc to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate an acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms 
there can be no assurance that the ftc or department of justice will not seek to bar us from acquiring additional television or radio stations in any market where our existing stations already have a significant market share 
similarly  the fcc staff has adopted procedures to review proposed broadcasting transactions even if the proposed acquisition otherwise complies with the fcc s ownership limitations 
in particular  the fcc may invite public comment on proposed transactions that the fcc believes  based on its initial analysis  may present ownership concentration concerns in a particular local radio market 
the fcc has delayed its approval of 
table of contents numerous proposed television or radio station purchases by various parties because of market concentration concerns  and generally will not approve acquisitions when the ftc or department of justice has expressed concentration concerns even if the acquisition complies with the fcc s numerical station limits 
moreover  in recent years the fcc has followed a policy of giving specific public notice of its intention to conduct additional ownership concentration analysis  and soliciting public comment on the issue of concentration and its effect on competition and diversity  with respect to certain applications for consent to radio station acquisitions based on advertising revenue shares or other criteria 
the fcc has recently expressed their desire to eliminate delays in the staff s review of transactions that might involve concentration of market share but are otherwise consistent with the radio ownership limits set forth in the communications act 
it is uncertain at this time what effect this will have on the fcc s review of future television or radio station sale applications 
additionally  the fcc has recently solicited public comment on a variety of possible changes in the methodology by which it defines a television or radio market and counts stations for purposes of determining compliance with local ownership restrictions 
if adopted  any such changes could limit our ability to make future acquisitions of radio stations 
moreover  in the same proceeding  the fcc has announced a policy of deferring  until the rulemaking is completed  certain pending and future television or radio sale applications which raise concerns about how the fcc counts the number of stations a company may own in a market 
this policy may delay future acquisitions for which we must seek fcc approval 
if regulation of outdoor advertising increases  we could suffer decreased revenue from our outdoor operations 
our outdoor operations are significantly impacted by federal  state and local government regulation of the outdoor advertising business 
these regulations impose restrictions on  among other things  the location  size and spacing of billboards 
if we are required to remove our existing billboards  or are unable to construct new billboards or reconstruct damaged billboards  our outdoor business could be harmed 
in addition  we may not receive compensation for billboards that we may be required to remove in the future 
additional regulations may be imposed on outdoor advertising in the future 
legislation regulating the content of billboard advertisements has been introduced and passed in congress from time to time in the past 
additional regulations or changes in the current laws regulating and affecting outdoor advertising at the federal  state or local level may harm the results of our outdoor operations 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards which characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the television and radio broadcasting industry is subject to technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies are being developed  including the following audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers and internet based audio radio services  satellite digital audio radio service with numerous channels and sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs  in band on channel digital radio  which could provide multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast outlets that are designed to serve local interests  streaming video programming delivered via the internet  
table of contents video on demand programming offered by cable television companies  and digital video recorders with hard drive storage capacity that offer time shifting of programming and the capability of deleting advertisements when playing back the recorded programs 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with other new technologies 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have on the television or radio broadcasting industry or on our company 
strikes  work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could disrupt our publishing operations 
our publishing business depends to a significant degree on our ability to avoid strikes and other work stoppages by our employees 
the newspaper and mail deliverers union of new york and vicinity and the newspaper guild of new york represent our publishing employees 
our collective bargaining agreement with the newspaper and mail deliverers union of new york and vicinity expires on march  our collective bargaining agreement with the newspaper guild of new york expires on june  we anticipate that negotiations will commence prior to the expiration of the agreement 
future collective bargaining agreements may not be negotiated without service interruptions  and the results of these negotiations may result in decreased revenue in our publishing operations 
risks related to our capital structure and outstanding securities stockholders who desire to change control of our company may be prevented from doing so by provisions of our first restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  applicable law  our credit agreement and the notes 
our restated certificate of incorporation and other agreements contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
our restated certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation could diminish the opportunities for a stockholder to participate in tender offers 
in addition  under our restated certificate of incorporation  our board of directors may issue preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 
the issuance of preferred stock could also negatively affect the voting power of holders of our common stock 
the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation may have the effect of discouraging or preventing an acquisition or sale of our business 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our common stock 
the transfer restrictions imposed on the broadcast licenses we own also restrict the ability of third parties to acquire us 
control of our licenses may only be transferred with prior approval by the fcc 
accordingly  the number of potential transferees of our licenses is limited  and any acquisition  merger or other business combination involving our company would be subject to regulatory approval 
in addition  the documents governing our indebtedness and the notes contain limitations on our ability to enter into a change of control transaction 
under these documents  the occurrence of a change of control transaction  in some cases after notice and grace periods  would constitute an event of default permitting acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness 
the issuance by us of preferred stock could affect the rights of our other stockholders 
our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series  to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of preferred stock  to fix the number of shares constituting any such 
table of contents series  and to fix the designation of any such series  without further vote or action by its stockholders 
the terms of any series of preferred stock  which may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights  could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock and thereby reduce the value of our common stock 
we have approximately million shares of series a convertible preferred stock outstanding 
we have no present plans to issue any additional shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock  coupled with the concentration of ownership of common stock in certain directors and executive officers  could discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of our company 
this includes transactions in which the holders of common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices  otherwise dilute the rights of holders of common stock  and may limit the ability of such stockholders to cause or approve transactions which they may deem to be in their best interests 
all of this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors  which may limit the remedies that we or our stockholders have available 
our restated certificate of incorporation provides that  pursuant to the delaware general corporation law  the liability of our directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under delaware law 
this is intended to eliminate the personal liability of a director for monetary damages in an action brought by us  or in our right  for breach of a director s duties to us or our stockholders and may limit the remedies available to us or our stockholders 
this provision does not eliminate the directors fiduciary duty and does not apply for certain liabilities i for acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing and culpable violation of law  ii for acts or omissions that a director believes to be contrary to our best interests or our stockholders or that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the director  and iii for any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit 
if the holders of our series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock exercise their option to redeem such preferred stock on or after april   we may not have sufficient funds to do so and we may be in default under the terms of our bank credit facility and or the notes 
the holders of a majority of our series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock have the right on or after april  to require us to redeem any and all of their preferred stock at the original issue price plus accrued dividends 
on april  such redemption price would be approximately million  and would continue to accrue a dividend of per year 
if we have sufficient funds under delaware law to pay but are prevented from redeeming their preferred stock because of restrictions in the indenture and or the bank credit facility  we would be in violation of the terms of the series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in such event  we may be in default under our bank credit facility and the holders of the series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock may be able to obtain a judgment against us 
any such judgment may be found to be pari passu with the claims of the holders of the notes 
in the event a judgment is obtained and remains unpaid  or the preferred stock is paid in violation of our bank credit facility or the indenture  we would be in default under our bank credit facility and the notes and we could be obligated to repay the obligations under our bank credit facility  if accelerated  and the notes  if accelerated 
we may not have sufficient funds at that time to pay all of our obligations in such event

overview we generate revenue from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations and advertising on our billboards and in our publication 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each media s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when the commercials are broadcast  outdoor advertising services are provided and publishing services are provided 
we incur commissions from agencies on local  regional and national advertising 
our revenue reflects deductions from gross revenue for commissions to these agencies 
univision currently owns approximately of our common stock 
we operate in four reportable segments based upon the types of advertising medium which consists of television broadcasting  radio broadcasting  outdoor advertising and newspaper publishing 
we own and or operate primary television stations that are located primarily in the southwestern us we own and or operate radio stations fm and am located primarily in arizona  california  colorado  florida  illinois  nevada  new mexico and texas 
our outdoor advertising segment owns approximately  billboards in los angeles and new york 
our newspaper publishing operations consist of a publication in new york 
the comparability of our results between  and is significantly affected by businesses we acquired in and our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staffs and our national representative firms  marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist of costs related to producing local newscasts in most of our markets 
we were organized as a delaware limited liability company in january to combine the operations of our predecessor entities 
on august   we completed a reorganization in which all of the outstanding direct and indirect membership interests of our predecessor were exchanged for shares of our class a and class b common stock and a million subordinated note and option held by univision were exchanged for shares of our class c common stock 
prior to our ipo  which also was completed on august   we had historically not had material income tax expense or benefit reflected in our statement of operations as the majority of our subsidiaries have been non taxpaying entities 
federal and state income taxes attributable to income during such periods were incurred and paid directly by the members of our predecessor 
however  we are now a taxpaying entity 
we anticipate that our future effective income tax rate will vary from due to a portion of our purchase price for the lcg and z spanish media acquisitions being allocated to non tax deductible goodwill 
in  we began the process of combining television and radio operations to create synergies and achieve cost savings and are continuing that process in as a result of the businesses and other assets we acquired in recent years  approximately of our total assets and of our net assets are intangible 
we review our tangible long lived assets and intangibles related to those assets periodically to determine potential impairment 
to date  we have determined that no impairment of long lived assets and goodwill exists 
in making this determination  the assumptions about future cash flows 
table of contents on the assets under evaluation are critical 
some stations under evaluation had limited cash flow in due to planned conversion of format or station power 
the assumptions about cash flows after conversion reflect management s estimates of how these stations are expected to perform based on similar stations and markets and possible proceeds from the sale of the assets 
if these expected increases or sale proceeds are not realized  impairment losses may be recorded in the future 
we are in the process of determining the expected impact on earnings and existing goodwill and other intangibles since our adoption of a new accounting standard  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no
