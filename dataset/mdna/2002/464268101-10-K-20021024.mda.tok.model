item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the remainder of our net sales  approximately percent in fiscal  came from product sales of other product lines  service  and freight billings 
the other product lines include process monitoring  supercritical fluid extraction sfe  and syringe pumps 
wastewater treatment customers use our process monitoring products to continuously monitor and control the treatment process to ensure that it is proceeding efficiently within established parameters 
our on line process monitors measure broad load parameters or detect the presence and concentration of a variety of compounds 
knowledge of these measurements allows the plant operator to control operating costs and ensures the quality of discharged effluent 
sfe is a safe  cost effective  environmentally friendly  and time saving technique used to separate selected chemical compounds target analytes from complex sample matrices 
our food and agri products customers use sfe to ensure that their products are maintained at a specified level of quality 
our syringe pumps are used for specialized applications in the petroleum  chemical and pharmaceutical industries  and for pumping supercritical fluids where high accuracy at high pressures is required 
the us prices of individual products within our core product lines range from  to  for wastewater sampler and flow meter products and  to  for lc products 
marketing and sales in the united states  independent manufacturers representatives sell products within our wastewater sampler  flow meter  and process monitoring product lines 
domestic sales of products within our lc  sfe  and syringe pump lines are made by direct sales people assigned to specific product lines and located in the prime domestic market areas 
the manufacturers representatives and our direct sales people are supported with promotional programs  advertising  applications specialists  applications bulletins  technical literature  training  and applications seminars 
international sales constituted   and percent of our net sales during fiscal   and  respectively 
isco s international sales are made primarily by independent dealers operating in various countries around the world 
international dealers receive sales management and local marketing support from regional sales and marketing managers that reside in lincoln  nebraska  belgium  germany  and the philippines 
to aid international sales  many of our products are offered in multiple language versions 
since both isco lincoln and stip isco sell in their respective functional currencies  we are not significantly impacted by direct foreign currency fluctuations 
customers isco has a broad customer base 
currently no single customer  including any oem customer  accounts for more than three percent of our net sales 
product warranty the majority of our products have a one year warranty against defective materials and workmanship 
our warranty claims have not been material in the past and are not expected to be material in the future 
we provide direct after market factory service for most products in the united states and germany with independent dealers providing this type of support in most all other countries 
we also provide on site services in the united states and germany for process monitoring products along with on site services in the united states for automated lc and sfe systems 
customers within the united states may purchase an extended warranty for a selected product at the time they purchase a new instrument or while the instrument is still under warranty 
competition we believe we have a strong  competitive position in the markets for wastewater samplers  open channel flow meters  and sfe 
we maintain a competitive niche position in the lc market 
the factors that contribute to our competitive position include a reputation for high quality and service  technically advanced products that provide cost effective operation and unique features  an active research and development program that allows us to maintain technical leadership  a strong position in key markets  efficient production capabilities  and excellent distribution capabilities 
isco has several competitors in the wastewater sampler market 
in the united states  the major competitor is the danaher corporation 
we estimate that we have approximately percent of the domestic wastewater sampler market with the danaher corporation having approximately percent 
other domestic competitors are small and offer little competition 
significant competitors in europe include the danaher corporation and the endress hauser group 
there are numerous suppliers in the united states open channel flow meter market 
based upon market information we believe to be accurate  isco s major competitors are marsh mcbirney  inc  ads  siemens milltronics process instruments  inc  owned by siemens  and the danaher corporation 
significant competitors in europe include the danaher corporation  the endress hauser group  marsh mcbirney  inc  and siemens milltronics process instruments  inc major competitors in the closed pipe flow meter market include abb  krohne  and the endress hauser group 
with respect to lc  we believe we are the major producer of fraction collectors 
the largest lc systems competitor is amershem biosciences uk ltd 
our major competitors  in either hardware or disposable columns  are amersham biosciences uk ltd  argonaut technologies  inc  bio rad laboratories  inc  biotage  inc  owned by the dyax corporation  and gilson medical electronics  inc there are a number of suppliers for the process monitoring markets with market share varying from country to country 
while limited information is available  we believe that the primary global competitors are the danaher corporation  wtw  lar analytik umwelt messtechnik gmbh  and the endress hauser group 
in the sfe equipment market we are the market leader with approximately percent of the world market share 
management estimates that its competitors  applied separations  inc and leco corporation  each have a market share of less than percent  with the remaining market served by specialty engineering firms 
with respect to syringe pumps  market share is difficult to estimate due to the various niche markets we service 
in the united states  our major competitor is quizix  inc we believe that we hold a dominant position relative to quizix  inc in all but one niche market 
research and engineering isco commits significant resources to ongoing research and engineering activities 
a significant amount of our research and engineering activities are focused on new product development targeted to increase our market share of existing product lines 
in addition  in the near term  we will be funding activities related to the new technological advancements in the area of liquid chromatography column media and our process monitoring product line 
over the long term we will explore present and related markets that could utilize new products developed from our expanding technology base 
for fiscal years   and  we spent approximately million or percent of sales  million or percent of sales  and  million or percent of sales  respectively  on research and engineering 
patents and licenses we believe we derive a competitive advantage from our patents and have a policy of obtaining patents wherever commercially feasible 
we also vigorously assert and defend our patents 
isco  inc s products are covered by united states patents  of which are owned by isco  inc and five under which we are the exclusive licensee 
there are also numerous corresponding patents issued by other countries 
isco  inc owned patents have been assigned to us by the inventors on a royalty free basis 
we currently have nine patent applications pending at the united states patent office 
regulation management believes isco is in compliance with current environmental regulations 
therefore  no unfavorable impact on competition or earnings is expected 
we have no government contracts that are subject to renegotiation of profits upon contract completion 
although our products are not subject to significant government regulation  the markets for many of our products are regulation driven 
backlog on september   isco s order backlog was million  the majority of which is scheduled for delivery prior to july   the close of fiscal a year earlier  on september   the order backlog was milllion 
manufacturing and sources of supply isco lincoln s manufacturing operations are vertically integrated 
we fabricate most of the metal and plastic components used in our products and obtain the required raw materials from several sources 
production planning is handled by a computerized production control system that ensures raw materials and sub component parts are received on time for final assembly 
since we are not reliant upon outside suppliers for these types of components  we are generally able to produce them at a lower cost and maintain a consistently high level of quality 
products manufactured by isco lincoln use a variety of mechanical  electrical  and electronic components 
most of these components are available from several sources 
currently  we are not experiencing any shortage of raw materials or components 
stip s manufacturing operations consist mainly of final assembly and testing  with most other processes outsourced 
currently  we have not experienced any shortages 
production planning is handled by computerized production control systems that ensure raw materials and sub component parts are received on time for final assembly 
employees on september   we had employees 
there were employees engaged in production  in research and engineering  in marketing and sales  and in administration 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have never experienced a work stoppage 
item properties 
the expansion and renovation of our superior street facility was completed in august we added approximately  square feet to the existing main building  bringing the total square footage at this location to approximately  square feet 
the layout of the renovated facility  the installation of space saving and more efficient equipment  and an open office environment allow us to perform our operations using less floor space 
the superior street facility houses our corporate  executive  and administrative offices along with sales  research  engineering  manufacturing  and maintenance activities 
the buildings at superior street in lincoln  nebraska are located on approximately acres 
the superior street facility is owned and unencumbered 
the building at westgate boulevard  lincoln  nebraska was sold in february stip leases  square meters in a building located in gro umstadt  germany 
the facility houses the engineering  manufacturing  marketing  selling  and administrative activities of stip 
the lease expires december  stip has the option to extend the lease for an additional three years 
item legal proceedings 
we filed an action in the united states district court for the district of nebraska against cornell research foundation  inc cornell on january   seeking to enjoin cornell from terminating a patent license agreement dated april  license 
our action was precipitated by a notice from cornell terminating the license and alleging that we had not been diligent in developing a commercial product 
the suit in nebraska has been dismissed and we filed a corresponding action in the united states district court for the northern district of new york on september  we joined advion biosciences  inc advion another licensee on the same patent as a co defendant with cornell 
pursuant to the rights granted in the license  we developed several new high performance liquid chromatography columns utilizing monolithic packing swift and began marketing them in early july in response to our suit  cornell is demanding arbitration of the dispute 
we have moved for a stay of arbitration in the supreme court of new york 
both actions are in their preliminary stages and neither court has held any hearings or taken any action to date 
we intend to pursue this matter very vigorously  and believe that we will prevail in this matter 
at the same time  the scope of our license is being arbitrated with a decision expected in december of this year 
this arbitration relates to products not yet being sold by us 
we intend to continue with its marketing efforts on the new column products

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements throughout this document as a result of the factors set forth below in the section entitled factors affecting future results and elsewhere in this document 
all references to years mean our fiscal year

these items are identified under item  selected financial data 
pro forma data has been included in this selected financial data that removes the impact of these nonrecurring charges and the operations of geomation since fiscal net sales analysis and review to comparison our net sales of million for the year ended july  were four percent above fiscal net sales of million 
revenues related to our core product lines wastewater samplers  flow meters including closed pipe flow meters  and liquid chromatography were up three percent  an increase of million over last year 
flow meter and liquid chromatography revenues increased by percent or million and percent or million  respectively over the prior year  while sampler revenues declined by percent or million 
the year over year increases in flow meter and liquid chromatography revenues were due to successful new product introductions 
specifically  new liquid chromatography hardware and disposable columns  focused on the niche market of drug discovery  significantly contributed to the overall increase 
the year over year decline in sampler revenues was due to the combination of increased competition and declining economic conditions that existed throughout the world markets in the current year 
in addition  fiscal was positively impacted by isco s ability to generate sampler revenues related to several one time  domestic  regulatory driven demands 
other revenues outside of our core product lines including the product lines of process monitoring  supercritical fluid extraction sfe  and syringe pumps  along with revenues related to equipment repairs and billed freight were up by  or seven percent from last year 
the increase was provided by growth in process monitoring and sfe product revenues along with increased freight revenues partially offset by decreased sales of syringe pump products 
domestic revenues of million for the year were up three percent from the prior year 
domestic revenues related to our core product lines for the year increased four percent over fiscal flow meter and liquid chromatography revenues accounted for the increase  partially offset by the decline in sampler related revenues 
our other domestic revenues were flat year over year 
the revenue increases in the areas of process monitoring  sfe  and freight revenues were offset by a decline in revenues from syringe pumps 
international revenues of million for the year were up seven percent from the prior year 
international revenues related to our core product lines for the year increased one percent over last year 
revenues related to liquid chromatography products accounted for the increase  which was offset by the decline in sampler related revenues 
our other international revenues were up percent  with the syringe pump line accounting for the majority of the increase 
net orders of million were received during fiscal  an increase of three percent compared with fiscal the order backlog at july  was million  down three percent from the beginning of the fiscal year 
as of september  our order backlog was million  the majority of which is scheduled for delivery prior to july   the close of fiscal to comparison our net sales for the year ended july  of million were three percent above fiscal sales of million 
removing the impact of geomation from both fiscal years  sales were up four percent 
revenues related to our core product lines wastewater samplers  flow meters including closed pipe flow meters  and liquid chromatography were up seven percent or increased by million over fiscal sampler and liquid chromatography revenues increased by percent or million and percent or million  respectively over the prior year while flow meter revenues declined by nine percent or million 
the under performance in revenues related to flow meters for fiscal year was the result of a number of factors  including a disruption in product management 
other revenues outside of our core product lines including the product lines of process monitoring  supercritical fluid extraction sfe  syringe pumps  and geomation  along with revenues related to equipment repairs and billed freight were down by million or percent from fiscal our other revenues were affected by the reduction in geomation revenues due to the sale of the net assets of this entity at the beginning of fiscal removing the revenues associated with geomation from both fiscal years results  our other revenues were approximately the same for both fiscal years 
while these revenues were flat  we experienced a decline in sfe revenues offset by increased syringe pump revenues along with additional freight revenues 
we began to bill for domestic freight in fiscal domestic revenues for fiscal were up three percent over fiscal domestic revenues related to our core product lines increased eight percent over fiscal revenues associated with samplers and liquid chromatography accounted for the increase  offset by a decline related to flow meters 
our other domestic revenues were down percent from fiscal removing the impact of geomation  our other revenues decreased five percent from fiscal this decline was driven by reduced revenues associated with sfe offset by increased syringe pump revenues along with additional freight revenues 
international revenues for fiscal were up four percent over fiscal international revenues related to our core product lines increased five percent over fiscal all of our core product lines contributed to the year over year increase in revenues 
our other international revenues increased by two percent over fiscal removing the impact of geomation  the other international revenues increased by five percent over the previous year 
this increase was driven by revenues from the sfe and syringe pump product lines 
net orders of million were received during fiscal  an increase of six percent or million compared with fiscal removing the impact of geomation from both fiscal years  fiscal year net orders were up nine percent over the prior year 
the order backlog at july  was million  up approximately percent from the beginning of the fiscal year 
the order backlog at july  included  for geomation 
operating income analysis and review to comparison we had income from operations of million for fiscal compared with income from operations of million for fiscal  a decline of million 
fiscal year income from operations included a  benefit from the settlement of the erp lawsuit 
adjusting for the impact of this settlement  income from operations for fiscal decreased by percent or  from the prior year 
this decline was due to incremental operating expenses being greater than the incremental gross margin dollars generated on increased net sales 
the gross margin  as a percentage of sales  declined slightly to percent for fiscal compared with percent for the prior year 
the decline in the gross margin percentage was due to increased direct manufacturing costs 
the impact of increased manufacturing costs was significantly offset by the benefit received from a change in our domestic product line mix from fiscal to fiscal operating expenses  excluding the benefit of the previous year s erp lawsuit settlement discussed above  increased by million over fiscal the selling  general and administrative sg a and engineering expense categories both contributed to the increase 
included in this increase is approximately  of increased expenses associated with swift  with the majority of costs focused on building sales and marketing infastructure to launch the swift columns in july excluding our investment in swift  sg a increased by approximately million 
a significant portion of this increase was due to increased sales and marketing personnel costs due to staffing increases along with increases in the cost of the executive compensation program both in cash incentives and non cash charges related to performance based stock options 
these increases were partially offset by reduced domestic advertising and promotion expenses 
engineering expense increased by  over the prior year due to normal increases in personnel expenses and increased subcontracted development costs 
in total  other income increased by  over the previous year 
improved earnings performance from aftco  isco s joint venture  was the primary factor in the increase 
while our average investment balances were higher in the current year  lower yield rates resulted in the slightly lower levels of investment income for the current year 
interest expense decreased by  from the previous year  as average debt outstanding was lower and interest rates on line of credit borrowings declined 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended july  was percent compared to an effective income tax rate of percent for the previous year 
the current year s effective rate was significantly lower than the statutory rate due to the implementation of new global tax strategies which allowed for the net operating loss valuation allowance to be removed 
the prior year s effective rate was also lower than the statutory rate due to tax benefits associated with isco s foreign sales corporation and changes in the net operating loss valuation allowance 
to comparison we had income from operations of million for fiscal compared with a loss of million for fiscal  an improvement of million 
there were several one time items and a change in classification that impacted the results of both years and impacted the year over year improvement 
fiscal year incurred charges of million related to the write off of the erp operating system  million related to the loss on impairments and disposition of geomation  and a million operating loss from geomation 
fiscal year income from operations reflected a  benefit from the settlement of the erp lawsuit  a  operating loss from geomation  along with a benefit of  from the change in classification of net gain on sales of capitalized equipment that was reported as other income in fiscal and prior years 
adjusting for the impact of these items to income from operations  fiscal incurred a decrease in income from operations of approximately  from fiscal this decrease was due primarily to increased selling expenses being greater than the incremental gross margin dollars generated on increased sales 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent for fiscal year  the same level as in fiscal operating expenses decreased by million in fiscal year compared with fiscal year this year over year decrease was significantly impacted by the items stated above 
operating expenses actually increased by million after removing the net impact of all the above mentioned items 
the selling  general and administrative sg a and engineering expense categories both contributed to the increase 
excluding the sg a expenses of geomation  sg a  as a percentage of sales  increased from percent to percent from fiscal to fiscal  an increase of million 
the majority of the increase was attributable to personnel costs associated with planned staffing increases in the sales and marketing area 
in addition  sales commissions associated with domestic channel sales increased due to strong sampler product line sales along with other areas such as travel and product promotional expenditures 
excluding the effects of the geomation operations  research and engineering expenses  as a percentage of sales  remained at percent for both fiscal years and increased by  the increase was attributable to subcontracted product development activities 
in total  other income declined by  in fiscal compared with fiscal investment income increased by  due to a larger average investment balance in fiscal compared with the prior fiscal year 
the increase in investment income was offset by a decrease in other income due to the net proceeds on the sales of used equipment being reported in net sales and costs of sales in fiscal the other net category included net proceeds on the sale of capitalized equipment of  in fiscal our effective income tax rate for the year ended july  was percent 
fiscal year s effective rate was lower then the statutory rate due to tax benefits associated with isco s foreign sales corporation and changes in the net operating loss valuation allowance 
the tax benefit for fiscal realized on the net loss was at an effective tax rate of percent 
this effective tax rate was significantly reduced due to the non deductibility on the write off of the intangible assets related to the disposition of geomation 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity for isco are cash from operations  various credit facilities  and borrowing capacity 
cash flows from operations for the fiscal years of   and were approximately million  million  and million respectively 
net income adjusted for depreciation  changes in deferred taxes  and other miscellaneous non cash changes provided approximately million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
fiscal included a million benefit from the use of net operating loss carry forwards against taxable earnings while fiscal included a million benefit from the non cash charges associated with the erp write off and the loss on impairments and sale of geomation net assets 
the change in net operating assets provided us with approximately million and million of cash in fiscal years and  respectively  while the change in operating assets utilized cash of million in fiscal the cash provided or used in any given year for operating assets is partially dependent on the timing of orders and shipments 
we monitor several utilization measures to manage our key assets and liabilities 
our average days sales outstanding dso were days  days  and days for fiscal   and  respectively 
our average days of inventory on hand  on a fifo basis  were days  days  and days for fiscal   and  respectively 
the average days to pay on accounts payables and accrued expenses were days  days  and days for fiscal   and  respectively 
cash and investments totaled million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
in addition  we had working capital at july  of million and our current ratio was net capital expenditures were million  down from million in fiscal and up from million in fiscal after several years of not paying cash dividends  the company reinstated these dividends during the fiscal year and distributed total cash dividends of million in fiscal we did not have any material changes to our debt structure within the recent three year period 
in fiscal we made million of fixed debt repayments under the various contractual obligations compared to million for fiscal and at july   our total debt  including borrowings against lines of credit  was million with million in required repayments due next fiscal year 
in addition  at july  we had lines of credit with various banks totaling million of which million was available for future business needs 
our financial condition remains strong 
we believe that our cash and short term investments  operating cash flows  and available borrowing capacity provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods amounts in thousands

critical accounting policies accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of past collection history  aging of outstanding accounts receivables  and specific risks identified in the portfolio 
inventories inventories consist of purchased materials  raw materials  in process subassemblies  and finished goods 
inventory obsolescence cost has not historically been material and as a result we do not carry a reserve for obsolescence for the majority of our inventory 
we review our inventory balances to determine if inventories can be sold at amounts equal to or greater than their carrying amounts 
the review includes identification of slow moving inventories  obsolete inventories  and discontinued products or lines of products 
the identification process includes a review of historical performance of the inventory and current operational plans for the inventory 
if our actual results differ from our expectations with respect to the inventory sales at amounts equal to or greater than their carrying amounts  we would be required to adjust our inventory balances accordingly 
we use the link chain method for valuing the majority of our inventory on a lifo basis 
revenue recognition revenues are recorded when products are shipped to customers or  in instances where service is performed to customer requirements  upon the successful completion of such service 
we are generally not contractually obligated to accept returns  except for defective products 
sales are shown net of returns and discounts 
stock based compensation we have elected to account for fixed award stock options and nonemployee directors options under the provisions of apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
as such  no compensation cost has been recorded in the financial statements relative to these options 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these options for disclosure purposes 
we account for performance based awards granted under our employee stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of apb options granted under the performance based awards are subject to variable accounting treatment until the number of options that will vest is known 
options not vested at the end of each performance year are cancelled 
compensation expense is recorded based on difference between the closing market price at the date the shares vest and the exercise price as determined at the date the shares were granted 
deferred stock units granted to nonemployee directors are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  directors deferred stock units are recorded as compensation expense at estimated fair value on the date the units are earned by the director 
joint venture we account for our investment in the aftco joint venture using the equity method of accounting 
factors affecting future results looking forward to fiscal  we expect to improve our sales on a year over year basis but are uncertain about our ability to increase income from operations on the same basis 
this uncertainty for improved income from operations is due to our firm commitment to continued product development activities along with focused sales and marketing efforts to build and expand the business in the areas of process monitoring and the swift monolithic column media for liquid chromatography  which we feel are critical for our long term success 
the majority of the planned increases in operating expenses for fiscal are due to the introduction of the new swift columns 
we anticipate spending between million and million in this area in fiscal  which represents an increase in operating expenses of between  and  in fiscal while we continually look for opportunities to improve our operational effectiveness  we are uncertain if we can make improvement in our operations that equal or exceed the additional expenditures 
in addition to the controllable business items stated above  the global economic and political outlook remains decidedly uncertain  and could significantly affect our performance 
with approximately percent of our sales coming from the regulatory driven environmental market  we recognize that we may be positively or negatively affected by changes in governmental regulations and the emphasis on program funding 
we are concerned that the united states and other countries may need to divert funds from environmental areas into their military and infrastructures due to increased concerns of terrorism and or war 
looking beyond fiscal  we are strategically committed to product and market development as a means to achieve sales growth 
our strong financial position will allow us to selectively increase product development  sales  and marketing expenditures to capitalize on value creating opportunities 
the outcome of our current legal proceedings related to swift will have a significant impact on our long term strategic activities in the area of liquid chromatography 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in retaining our license  we will shift focus and resources to ensure continued long term growth in this product area 
in our environmental market area  we are experiencing a continuing consolidation of competitors 
as a result  we are dealing with the effects of larger  well financed competitors who also have the organizational resources and breadth of product lines to compete aggressively in the global marketplace 
while we feel that we can effectively compete with these larger organizations on the basis of agility  speed  and responsiveness  they do continue to present a potent threat 
market risk interest rate risk and currency exchange risks are the primary market risks to which we are exposed 
we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments 
our other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  accounts and notes payable  and long term debt 
our cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  and accounts and notes payable balances are generally short term in nature and do not expose our company to material market risk 
at july   we had approximately million of fixed rate debt  along with million of variable rate credit facilities  of which approximately million was outstanding under these credit facilities 
at july   we had approximately million of fixed rate debt  along with million of variable rate credit facilities  of which approximately million was outstanding under these credit facilities 
we do not believe that changes in interest rates on the debt and credit facilities would have a material effect on our results of operations  given the amount of our obligations under these debt and credit facilities 
related to currency exchange  international sales of our united states based operations are denominated in us dollars and international sales of our german subsidiary are denominated in euros 
the currency exchange risk at the current level of activity is not material to our operating results or financial position 
our market risk resulting from the translation of the profit and loss of stip and from our permanent investment in our foreign subsidiaries is not material 
inflation the effect of inflation on our costs and our ability to pass on cost increases in the form of increased prices is dependent upon market conditions and the competitive environment 
the general level of inflation in the us economy has been relatively low for the past several years and has not  to date  had a significant effect on the cost of acquiring materials for production 
legal proceedings we filed an action in the united states district court for the district of nebraska against cornell research foundation  inc cornell on january   seeking to enjoin cornell from terminating a patent license agreement dated april  license 
our action was precipitated by a notice from cornell terminating the license  alleging that we had not been diligent in developing a commercial product 
the suit in nebraska has been dismissed and we filed a corresponding action in the united states district court for the northern district of new york on september  we joined advion biosciences  inc advion another licensee on the same patent as a co defendant with cornell
