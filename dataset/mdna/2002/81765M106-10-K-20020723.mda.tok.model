the company also has exposure to increased costs for many reasons beyond its immediate control  including  but not limited to  unexpected costs  delays due to weather  or an individual customer s scheduling adjustments 
therefore  the company cannot predict whether or how long the percentages reflected above will continue at the current levels

effects of inflation on revenues and operating profits the effects of inflation upon the company s operating results are varied 
inflation in recent years has been modest and has had minimal effect on the company 
the construction segment subcontracts most of its work at fixed prices  which normally will help that segment protect its profit margin from any erosion due to inflation 
in the real estate segment  many of the anchor leases are long term original terms over years  with fixed rents  except for contingent rent provisions by which the company may earn additional rent as a result of increases in tenants sales 
in many cases  however  the contingent rent provisions permit the anchor tenant to offset against contingent rents any increases in ad valorem taxes over a specified amount 
if inflation were to rise  ad valorem taxes would probably increase as well  which  in turn  could cause a decrease in the contingent rents 
furthermore  the company has certain repair obligations  and the costs of repairs increase with inflation 
the energy management segment generally has contracts that renew on an annual basis 
at the time of renewal  contract fees may be adjusted  subject to customer approval 
as inflation impacts the company s costs  primarily labor  the company could seek a price increase for its contracts in order to protect its profit margin 
inflation causes interest rates to rise  which has a positive effect on investment income  but could have a negative effect on profit margins because of the increased costs of contracts and the increase in interest expense on variable rate loans 
overall  inflation could tend to limit the company s markets and  in turn  could reduce revenues as well as operating profits and earnings
