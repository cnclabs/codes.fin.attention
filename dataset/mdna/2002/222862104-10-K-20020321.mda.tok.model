health insurance portability and accountability act of the health insurance portability and accountability act of imposes new requirements relating to a variety of issues that affect the company s business  including the privacy of medical information  limits on exclusions based on preexisting conditions for certain plans  guaranteed renewability of health care coverage for most employers and individuals and administrative simplification procedures involving the standardization of transactions and the establishment of uniform health care provider  payor and employer identifiers 
various agencies of the federal government have issued regulations to implement certain sections of this act 
this law is far reaching and complex  and proper interpretation and practice under the law continues to evolve 
because the rules implementing this law are still evolving  we cannot assure you that the costs of compliance with this law will not adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to significantly change the way we operate our business 
on december   the department of health and human services released a final rule regarding standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information 
the primary purposes of the final rule are to protect and enhance the rights of consumers by providing them access to their health information and controlling the inappropriate use of that information  and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery by creating a national framework for health privacy protection that builds on efforts by states  health systems  individual organizations and individuals 
the final rule was effective april health plans  providers and health care clearinghouses have until april  to come into compliance with the final rule 
we have instituted a process to ensure our compliance with the final rule by that date 
the department of health and human services published a proposed rule containing security standards in august a final security rule has not been published  but the proposed rule would require health plans  providers and health care clearinghouses to implement organizational and technical practices to protect the security of electronically maintained or transmitted health related information 
we cannot predict the final form that the security rule will take or the impact that the final rule will have on us 
the department of health and human services also released its final rule for electronic data standards under the health insurance portability and accountability act of on august   effective october  this rule establishes the standard data content and format for the electronic submission of claims and other administrative health transactions 
compliance with these regulations is required by october  recently enacted legislation would extend the compliance date until october  for entities that file a plan with the department of health and human services that demonstrates how they intend to comply with the regulations by the extended deadline 
we have instituted a process to ensure our compliance with the final rule by the mandatory compliance date 
on january   the us department of labor s pension and welfare benefits administration  the internal revenue service and the department of health and human services issued two regulations that provide guidance on the nondiscrimination provisions under the health insurance portability and accountability act of as they relate to health factors and wellness programs 
these nondiscrimination provisions prohibit a group health plan or group health insurance issuer from denying an individual eligibility for benefits or charging an individual a higher premium based on a health factor 
we currently do not believe that these regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business 
employee retirement income security act of the provision of services to certain employee health benefit plans is subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us and employers who maintain employee benefit plans subject to erisa 
some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under erisa 
in addition  some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans 
we provide a variety of products and services to employee benefit plans that are covered by erisa 
on november   the us department of labor issued a final rule relating to benefit claims and appeal procedures for plans under erisa  disability plans and other employee benefit plans 
the rule shortens the time allowed for health and disability plans to respond to claims and appeals  establishes new requirements for plan responses to appeals and expands required disclosures to participants and beneficiaries 
the rule applies to claims filed under a group health plan on or after the first day of the first plan year beginning on or after july  and not later than january  we have instituted a process to ensure our compliance with the rule by the mandatory compliance date 
we currently do not believe that the rule will have a material adverse effect on our business 
medicaid and medicare choice some of our hmos contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services to provide services to medicare beneficiaries pursuant to the medicare choice program 
some of our hmos also contract with states to provide health benefits to medicaid recipients 
as a result  we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services may audit any health plan operating under a medicare choice contract to determine the plan s compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations 
in addition  we must file cost reimbursement reports for the medicare cost contracts  which are subject to audit and revision 
as a result of the medicare choice and medicaid products we offer  we are subject to regulatory and legislative changes in those two government programs 
the balanced budget refinement act of was enacted on november  this law modifies the balanced budget act of  which had made substantial revisions to the medicare and medicaid programs 
specifically  the balanced budget refinement act of revised the enrollment rules and risk adjustment methodology of the medicare choice program 
additionally  this law offers limited incentives to health plans to offer medicare choice plans in areas which currently do not have medicare choice plans 
the balanced budget refinement act of also allows medicare choice plans greater flexibility in structuring benefit packages for enrollees in the same service area 
at this time  we do not believe that the balanced budget refinement act of will have a material effect on our operations 
the united states congress enacted the benefit improvement and protection act of in december this law increases medicare and medicaid provider payments and enhances the benefit package for medicare beneficiaries 
the increased payment amounts were effective march  these amounts may only be used by medicare choice plans to increase funds to reduce beneficiary premiums or copayments  enhance benefits  stabilize or widen the network of health care providers available to beneficiaries or reserve funds to help offset premium increases or reduced benefits in the future 
at this time  management does not believe that the benefit improvement and protection act of will have a material effect on our operations 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services and the appropriate state regulatory agency have the right to audit any health plan operating under a medicaid managed care contract to determine the plan s compliance with state and federal law 
in some instances  states engage peer review organizations to perform quality assurance and utilization review oversight of medicaid managed care plans 
our hmos are required to abide by the peer review organizations standards 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services issued a final medicaid managed care rule on january  the final rule includes strengthened beneficiary protections and new provisions designed to protect the rights of participants in the medicaid program 
specifically  the final rule requires states to assure continuous access to care for beneficiaries with ongoing health care needs who transfer from one health plan to another 
the new rule also requires states and plans to identify enrollees with special health care needs and to assess the quality and appropriateness of their care 
we currently do not believe that the rule will have a material adverse effect on our business 
the social security act imposes criminal and civil penalties for paying or receiving remuneration which is deemed to include a kickback  bribe or rebate in connection with any federal health care program  including the medicare  medicaid and federal employees health benefits programs fehbp 
the law and related regulations have been interpreted to prohibit the payment  solicitation  offering or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of federal health care program patients or any item or service that is reimbursed  in whole or part  by any federal health care program 
similar anti kickback provisions have been adopted by many states  which apply regardless of the source of reimbursement 
in  as part of the health insurance portability and accountability act of  congress adopted a statutory exception for certain risk sharing arrangements 
the office of the inspector general has published two safe harbors addressing these risk sharing arrangements 
we believe that our risk agreements satisfy the requirements of these safe harbors 
in addition  the office of the inspector general has adopted other safe harbor regulations that relate to managed care arrangements 
we believe that the incentives offered by our hmos to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and the discounts our plans receive from contracting health care providers should satisfy the requirements of these safe harbor regulations 
a safe harbor is a regulation that describes relationships and activities that are deemed not to violate the federal anti kickback statute 
however  failure to satisfy each criterion of an applicable safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement constitutes a violation of the law  rather the arrangement must be analyzed on the basis of its specific facts and circumstances 
we believe that our arrangements do not violate the federal or similar state anti kickback laws 
federal employees health benefits program we contract with the united states office of personnel management opm to provide managed health care services under the fehbp 
these contracts with the opm and applicable government regulations establish premium rating requirements for this program 
the opm conducts periodic audits of its contractors to  among other things  verify that the premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under the fehbp 
the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program 
as a result  these audits could result in material adjustments 
healthamerica pennsylvania  inc  our pennsylvania hmo subsidiary  has received draft audit reports from the opm that questioned subscription charges paid to healthamerica under the fehbp 
the draft audit reports questioned approximately million of subscription charges paid to healthamerica with respect to contract years through as possibly constituting overcharges resulting from defective pricing in violation of healthamerica s fehbp contract 
the reports also recommend that if these amounts are deemed to be due  approximately million in lost investment income charges should also be recovered with respect to such overcharges  with additional interest continuing to accrue until repayment of the overcharged amounts 
healthamerica responded to the draft audit reports in may and august  accepting certain of the draft audit reports recommendations but disagreeing with others 
in august  the us attorney for the district of columbia sent healthamerica a letter indicating that the audit reports had been referred to the office of the us attorney for consideration of a possible civil action against healthamerica under the federal false claims act with respect to the fehbp contract years through the letter stated that healthamerica may have knowingly overcharged the fehbp approximately million as a result of alleged discounts provided to other groups that also should have been provided for the fehbp 
in the event of such an overcharging  the letter also stated that healthamerica would be responsible for an additional approximately million in interest through december  with further interest accruing to the date of repayment 
violations of the federal false claims act could subject healthamerica to liability for civil penalties and treble damages 
since receipt of the letter from the us attorney  healthamerica has responded to the letter and provided supplemental information in support of its position 
the pending inquiry may be resolved by agreement with the office of the us attorney or the opm with a payment to the government 
if an agreement is not reached  the us attorney or the opm may commence a legal action against healthamerica 
although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the pending inquiry or any related litigation that may arise in this matter  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
recent federal managed care legislative proposals on august   the house of representatives passed a version of the patients bill of rights legislation an amended version of the ganske dingell bill that would permit health plans to be sued in state court for coverage determinations 
the current administration has indicated a willingness to pass some form of patient protection legislation which could adversely affect the health benefits business  and the bill adopted by the house was the result of a compromise reached by president bush and representative charles norwood of georgia 
under the bill  a claim would be permitted for a wrongful coverage denial that is the proximate cause of personal injury to  or the death of  a patient 
medically reviewable claims against health insurers would be tried in state court but under federal law 
patients would be required to exhaust external review before filing suit 
patients who lose an external review decision would have to overcome a rebuttable presumption that the insurer made the correct decision 
the bill caps non economic damages at million 
punitive damages would be available only if insurers do not follow an external review decision and would be capped at an additional million 
the bill also limits class action lawsuits both future suits and pending suits where a class has not yet been certified against health insurers under both erisa and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico to group health plans established by a single plan sponsor 
the senate version of the patients bill of rights legislation the mccain edwards bill was passed on june  and contains broader liability provisions than the house bill 
the senate bill would permit patients to sue health plans in state court over medical judgments or in federal court over contractual issues  and it would not cap damages in state courts 
in federal court  punitive damages would be allowed  up to million  and there would be no limit on economic and non economic damages 
president bush has stated that he will veto any patients bill of rights legislation that contains liability provisions similar to the senate bill 
the house and senate versions of the bill are expected to be reconciled in the conference committee 
we cannot predict the provisions of the patients rights legislation that may emerge from the conference committee  if any  and whether any patients bill of rights legislation will be enacted into law 
we also cannot predict what impact any patients bill of rights or other federal legislation would have on our business and operations 
numerous other proposals have been introduced in the united states congress and various state legislatures relating to managed health care reform 
the provisions of legislation that may be adopted at the state level cannot be accurately and completely predicted at this time  and we therefore cannot predict the effect on our operations of proposed legislation 
on the federal level  we expect that some form of managed health care reform may be enacted 
at this time  it is unclear as to when any legislation might be enacted or the content of any new legislation  and we cannot predict the effect on our operations of the proposed legislation or any other legislation that may be adopted 
risk management we maintain general liability and professional liability insurance coverage in amounts that we believe is appropriate 
until recently  we also maintained medical excess stop loss reinsurance coverage covering a portion of the medical risk we had underwritten through our risk products 
we no longer maintain stop loss reinsurance coverage because we do not believe it is cost efficient to maintain it in light of current conditions in the insurance market 
employees at march   we employed approximately  persons  none of whom are covered by a collective bargaining agreement

 styled in re humana  inc  managed care litigation  charles b 
shane  md  et al 
vs 
humana  inc  et al 
this matter is a purported class action lawsuit filed by a group of health care providers against our company and other defendants in the managed care field 
the lawsuit alleges multiple violations of rico  violations of the prompt pay statutes in certain states and breaches of contract for failure to pay claims 
the lawsuit seeks declaratory  injunctive  compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution  costs  fees and interest payments 
although we cannot predict the outcome  we believe this suit is without merit and intend to defend our position vigorously 
we may be the target of other similar lawsuits involving rico and the erisa  generally claiming that managed care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health care 
although we may be the target of other similar lawsuits  we believe there is no valid basis for such lawsuits 
our industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
general overview we are a leading publicly traded managed health care company with approximately million members 
we operate a diversified portfolio of local market health plans serving states  primarily in the mid atlantic  midwest and southeast regions 
we offer employers a broad range of commercial managed care products that vary with respect to the level of benefits provided  the costs paid by employers and members  and the extent to which members access to providers is subject to referral or preauthorization requirements 
we offer underwritten or risk products  including health maintenance organizations hmo s  preferred provider organizations ppo s and point of service pos plans 
in addition  we recently began offering defined contribution health plans 
our risk products also include state sponsored managed medicaid programs and medicare choice programs in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels  provider costs and regulatory climates 
for our risk products  we receive premiums in exchange for assuming underwriting risks and performing sales  marketing and administrative functions 
we also offer non risk products  including access to our provider networks and management services  to employers that self insure employee health benefits 
the management services we provide typically include network management  claims processing  utilization review and quality assurance 
for our non risk products  we receive fees for the access to our provider networks and the management services we provide  but we do not have underwriting risk 
on may   we began trading on the new york stock exchange under the new ticker symbol cvh 
previously  we had been trading on the nasdaq stock market under the ticker symbol cvty 
revenues we generate revenues from managed care premiums and management services 
our managed care premiums are derived from our commercial risk products and our government programs 
our commercial managed care premium revenues are comprised of premiums from our commercial hmo products and flexible provider products  including ppo and pos products for which we assume full underwriting risk 
premiums for such commercial ppo and pos products are typically lower than hmo premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are required of the ppo and pos members 
premium rates for commercial hmo products are reviewed by various state agencies based on rate filings 
while we have not had such filings modified  no assurance can be given that approvals for rate submissions will continue 
the public sector managed care premium revenues consist of premiums from our medicare and medicaid products 
we provide comprehensive health benefits to members participating in government programs and receive premium payments from federal and state governments 
premium rates for the medicaid and medicare products are established by governmental regulatory agencies and may be reduced by regulatory action 
during the three years ended december   we experienced substantial growth in operating revenues due primarily to membership increases from acquisitions 
additional membership growth was achieved through marketing efforts  geographic expansion and increased product offerings 
one such product offering was the expansion of our ppo risk product to all of our health plans in another new product offering was the introduction of our healthassurance flex product in our pennsylvania market in our management services revenues result from operations in which our health plans provide administrative and other services to self insured employers and to employer group beneficiaries that have elected hmo coverage 
we receive an administrative fee for these services  but do not assume underwriting risk 
certain of our management services contracts include performance and utilization management standards that affect the fees received for these services 
in addition  we offer a ppo product to other third party payors  under which we provide rental of and access to our ppo network  claims repricing and utilization review  and do not assume underwriting risk 
we recognized management services revenue in under a marketing services agreement  management services agreement and ppo access agreement with principal 
these agreements either have expired or have been terminated as of december  expenses our primary operating expenses are medical expense  selling  general and administrative expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
our medical expense includes medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation payments 
medical expense also includes an estimate of claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
in determining our ibnr liabilities  we employ plan by plan standard actuarial reserve methods that are specific to the plan s membership  product characteristics  geographic territories and provider network 
we also consider utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient  outpatient  pharmacy and other medical expenses  as well as claim payment backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements 
estimates are reviewed by our underwriting  finance and accounting personnel and other appropriate plan and corporate personnel 
judgments are then made as to the necessity for reserves in addition to the estimated amounts 
changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience  changes in the delivery system  changes in pricing due to ancillary capitation and fluctuations in the claims backlog could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
we continually monitor and review our ibnr reserves  and as actual settlements are made or accruals adjusted  reflect these differences in current operations 
we currently believe that our estimates for ibnr liabilities are adequate to satisfy our ultimate medical claims liability after all medical claims have been reported 
in addition to the procedures for determining reserves as discussed above  we review the actual payout of claims relating to prior period accruals 
medical costs are affected by a variety of factors  including the severity and frequency of claims 
these factors are difficult to predict and may not be entirely within our control 
we continually refine our actuarial practices to incorporate new cost events and trends 
membership as of december   we had  members for whom we assume underwriting risk risk members and  members of self insured employers for whom we provide administrative services but do not assume underwriting risk non risk members

our business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  the operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition 
the purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets  including the identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities based on estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill 
prior to december   goodwill was amortized over a useful life of years 
in accordance with sfas no

in the fourth quarter of  we notified the indiana department of insurance of our intention to close our subsidiary  coventry health care of indiana  inc the indiana health plan did not operate profitably or demonstrate good prospects for future growth 
although closing the health plan did not have a substantial effect on consolidated earnings  it did allow us to focus resources and management attention on our other markets 
our transition plan gave employers and members ample time to obtain health care coverage through one of the many other companies operating in indiana 
effective december   our license to operate the indiana health plan had been withdrawn from the state 
as a result of the cost associated with exiting the indiana market  we recorded a reserve of million in the fourth quarter of we have expended substantially all of the reserve as of december  legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by us  medical malpractice actions  and other various claims seeking monetary damages 
the claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
incidents occurring through december  may result in the assertion of additional claims 
with respect to medical malpractice  we carry professional malpractice and general liability insurance for each of our operations on a claims made basis with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of these actions should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on april   we were served with an amended complaint filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida  miami division  mdl no 
 styled in re humana  inc  managed care litigation  charles b 
shane  md  et al 
vs 
humana  inc  et al 
this matter is a purported class action lawsuit filed by a group of health care providers against our company and other defendants in the managed care field 
the lawsuit alleges multiple violations of rico  violations of the prompt pay statutes in certain states and breaches of contract for failure to pay claims 
the lawsuit seeks declaratory  injunctive  compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution  costs  fees and interest payments 
although we cannot predict the outcome  we believe this suit is without merit and intend to defend our position vigorously 
we may be the target of other similar lawsuits involving rico and the erisa  generally claiming that managed care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health care 
although we may be the target of other similar lawsuits  we believe there is no valid basis for such lawsuits 
our industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
existing or future laws could have a significant effect on our operations 
results of operations the following table in thousands  except percentages and membership data is provided to facilitate a more meaningful discussion regarding the comparison of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  increase increase decrease decrease operating revenues managed care premiums     management services       total operating revenues     operating expenses medical costs     selling  general and administrative     depreciation and amortization      other charges      total operating expenses     operating earnings       net earnings     basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share medical loss ratios commercial medicare medicaid total administrative ratios selling  general and administrative membership at december commercial      medicare       medicaid       non risk       total membership      comparison of to managed care premium revenue increased in over primarily from rate increases that occurred throughout both years and from member growth  both organic and through acquisitions 
premium rates increased by an average of over on a per member per month pmpm basis  to pmpm 
we will continue to be diligent in attempting to obtain adequate premium increases and expect premium rates to increase more than on commercial renewals in the first quarter of the acquisitions that contributed to the increase in premium revenues occurred in the fourth quarter of and in the first  second  and third quarters of membership  and thus premium revenues  in the medicaid program continues to increase almost exclusively from growth in existing markets  including a new product offering in the fourth quarter of in our pennsylvania market 
during  we significantly increased medicare premiums in the st 
louis market  which was the primary reason for a membership loss in that market 
management services revenue increased in from as a result of three significant acquisitions wellpath in the fourth quarter of  health partners in the first quarter of and blue ridge in the third quarter of these three acquisitions accounted for approximately  new aso members 
medical costs increased in compared to due to business growth and medical trend 
business growth was primarily in the commercial and medicaid segments 
in the commercial segment  the increase in membership was mostly due to acquisitions throughout the year period 
medicaid growth was due to continuing underlying program growth 
a significant portion of the medicaid membership increase was related to a new lower cost mental health program from the state of pennsylvania implemented towards the end of selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased in primarily due to the additional expense associated with the acquired wellpath and blue ridge health plans 
sg a expense  as a percentage of revenue  decreased due to improved operational efficiencies  continued management scrutiny of administrative expenses  premium rate increases  and acquisitions which required minimal incremental sg a 
depreciation and amortization decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated 
in  we recorded gains related to the allegheny health  education and research foundation aherf bankruptcy proceedings  as described in the comparison of to section of this form k 
in  we recorded no charges related to these proceedings 
other income  net of interest expense  increased in from due to increased investment income as a result of an increase in the company s long term investments compared to the prior year 
we incurred no interest expense in due to the extinguishment of all outstanding debt in our provision for income taxes increased in due to an increase in operating earnings and other income  net  offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in this decrease in the tax rate is the result of strategic tax planning 
comparison of to managed care premium revenue increased in over as a result of rate increases and an increase in membership in existing plans and as a result of acquisitions 
the increase in managed care premium revenue was attributable primarily to premium rate increases in acquisitions occurring in the fourth quarter of and in the first  third  and fourth quarters of also contributed to the increase in managed care premium revenue 
membership  and thus premium revenue  in the medicare choice and medicaid programs continued to grow in as a result of acquisitions and growth in existing plans 
more than half of the increase in governmental program membership came from growth in existing markets 
management services revenue decreased in from as a result of the expiration of our ppo access  marketing services and management services agreements with principal health care  inc medical costs increased in over due almost equally to the additional expenses associated with acquisitions and increased health care costs and utilization 
despite the increase in medical costs  our medical loss ratio decreased due to medical costs increasing at a slower rate than premiums 
sg a expense increased in from  due primarily to the additional expense associated with the acquisition of the carelink  primeone  maxicare and wellpath health plans 
sg a expense  as a percentage of total operating revenues  decreased in from due to improved operational efficiencies resulting from the completion of the consolidation of service centers into four regional service centers and continued management scrutiny of administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in from due primarily to intangible assets relating to the acquisition of health plans from principal that were fully amortized by the end of the decrease in intangible asset amortization was partially offset by an increase in amortization of goodwill relating to acquisitions and an increase in computer software and hardware depreciation 
in  we recorded a charge of million for a reserve established for the closure of our indiana health plan 
in  we established a million reserve for medical and other costs under our global capitation agreement with aherf  a service provider that covered approximately  of our members  which filed for bankruptcy protection in in  we reached a settlement with certain health care providers relating to claims for medical services provided to our members that were covered by aherf

our provision for income taxes increased for from due to an increase in operating earnings and other income  net  offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in this decrease in the tax rate is the result of strategic tax planning 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated our total cash and investments  consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  but excluding deposits of million restricted under state regulations  increased million to million at december  from million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased over the prior year due to an increase in net earnings  an increase in deferred revenue related primarily to the timing of medicare premium payments  and an increase in medical claims liabilities as a result of the timing of medical claim payments 
net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended december  as a result of an increase in the amount of cash placed in short term and long term investments 
net cash used in financing activities during is primarily due to the repurchases of our common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in as compared to this improvement was primarily a result of million in claims runout in for the florida and illinois health plans that were sold in compared with minimal claims runout paid in this improvement was also a result of an increase in net earnings  an increase in accounts payable  other accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased in as compared to the decrease was due to a decrease in cash placed in short term and long term investments 
in  more cash was placed in short term and long term investments due to the implementation of an investment management program following the acquisition of certain health plans from principal health care  inc net cash provided by financing activities decreased in as compared to the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to an increase in repurchases of our common stock 
our investment guidelines emphasize investment grade fixed income instruments in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk of principal 
the fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of aa and an average contractual maturity of years  as of december  we believe that since our long term investments are available for sale  the amount of such investments should be added to current assets when assessing our working capital and liquidity 
on such basis  current assets plus long term investments available for sale less current liabilities increased to million at december  from million at december  on february   we announced that we completed the purchase of approximately million shares of our common stock and a warrant exercisable  at that time  for approximately million shares of our common stock  owned by principal health care  inc the aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock and the warrant was approximately million 
the purchase of the shares and warrant from principal ended their ownership of our common stock 
we financed the stock and warrant repurchase with the proceeds from the sale of million of our senior notes due february  interest on the notes is payable on february and august each year  beginning august  health plans our hmos and our insurance company subsidiary  coventry health and life insurance company ch l  are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances  thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from its hmos and ch l 
risk based capital rbc is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital deemed appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations with consideration for its size and risk profile 
this calculation  approved by the national association of insurance commissioners  incorporates asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk and business risk components 
our health plans are required to submit a rbc report to the naic and their domiciled state s department of insurance with their annual filing 
the rbc results are used to determine whether the health plan s net worth is adequate to support the amount of its calculated risk profile 
regulators use the rbc results to determine if any regulatory actions are required 
regulatory actions  if any  range from filing a financial corrective action plan to the health plan being placed under regulatory control 
the majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted a rbc policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the company action level which is currently equal to of their rbc currently for ch l 
although not all states have adopted the rbc policy  the total surplus in excess of for all of our hmo subsidiaries was approximately million at december   up from million at december  the increase is primarily due to current year earnings from our hmo subsidiaries and the previously mentioned acquisitions  offset by dividends paid to the parent company 
ch l had excess surplus of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase is primarily due to income from excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation  we had cash and investments of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively  which are available to make interest or principal payments on the senior notes or any other debt that we may have  to make loans to or investments in subsidiaries  to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
we have entered into agreements with certain of our regulated subsidiaries to provide additional capital  if necessary  to prevent the subsidiary s impairment of net worth requirements 
other projected capital investments in of approximately million consist primarily of computer hardware  software and related equipment costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communications systems 
the united states department of health and human services has issued rules  as mandated by the health insurance portability and accountability act of  which  among other things  impose security and privacy requirements with respect to individually identifiable patient data  including a member s transactions with health care providers and payors  as well as requirements for the standardization of certain electronic transaction code sets and provider identifiers 
the privacy standards were issued on december   and the final privacy regulations became effective on april  the compliance date is april  as of december   we had spent approximately  on compliance matters 
we anticipate spending approximately million in  approximately million of which we expect will be capitalized  related to our compliance with the electronic transaction code sets  provider identifier standards  and security and patient information privacy standards 
the nature of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to three months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs 
the demand for our products and services are subject to many economical fluctuations  risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business 
please refer to the risk factors section in this form k for more information 
management believes that our cash flows generated from operations  cash and investments  and excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations  capital expenditures  and debt interest costs at least through december  risk sensitive financial instruments and position we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
these policies include an emphasis on credit quality  management of portfolio duration  maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending upon market conditions 
our projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments  should potential changes in market rates occur  are presented below 
the analysis is based on a hypothetical change in interest rates of  and basis points 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses 
gains or losses would be realized upon the sale of these investments 
while we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible  actual results may differ 
increase decrease in fair value of portfolio given an interest rate decrease increase of x basis points in thousands share repurchase program on december   we announced a program to purchase up to of our outstanding common stock 
stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market  by block purchase or in private transactions 
we purchased  and  shares of our common stock in and  respectively  for the treasury at an aggregate cost of million and million in and  respectively 
these shares do not include the approximate million shares purchased from principal health care  inc previously mentioned 
we had approximately million diluted shares of common stock outstanding as of december  legislation and regulation numerous proposals have been introduced in the united states congress and various state legislatures relating to health care reform 
some proposals  if enacted  could among other things  restrict our ability to raise prices and to contract independently with employers and providers 
certain reform proposals favor the growth of managed health care  while others would adversely affect managed care 
although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level cannot be accurately predicted at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the short term 
pursuant to a health insurance portability and accountability act of mandate  the department of health and human services released a final rule regarding standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information on december   effective april  we expect to institute all necessary modifications to systems and business processes by the compliance date 
the department of health and human services also released its final rule for electronic data standards on august   effective october  we expect to institute all necessary modifications to systems and business processes by the compliance date 
insurance we maintain general liability and professional liability insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are appropriate 
until recently  we also maintained medical excess stop loss reinsurance coverage covering a portion of the medical risk we have underwritten through our risk products 
we no longer maintain stop loss reinsurance coverage because we do not believe it is cost efficient to maintain it in light of current conditions in the insurance market 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are ones we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult  subjective  or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates if different assumptions or information were used 
revenue recognition managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service 
premiums are based on per member contract rates and the membership in our records at the time of billing 
premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage 
premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations  additions  or other changes 
based on information received subsequent to premium billings being sent and based on historical trends  we estimate the amount of future retroactivity on a monthly basis and adjust revenue accordingly 
premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
employer contracts are typically on an annual basis  subject to cancellation by the employer group or the company upon thirty days written notice 
premiums for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the office of personal management opm on a periodic basis 
such audits are usually a number of years in arrears 
we record reserves  on an estimated basis annually  based on the appropriate guidelines 
any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized 
medical claims expense and liabilities medical claims liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported 
the estimated claims incurred but not reported are based on historical data  current enrollment  health service utilization statistics  and other related information as described in the expenses section earlier in the md a 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  management believes that the liability is adequate 
we also establish reserves  if required  for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts 
these accruals are continually monitored and reviewed  and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued two statements related to business combinations 
the first statement  sfas no 
business combinations  requires all business combinations  initiated after june   to be accounted for using the purchase method and prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting 
we currently use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations  and  therefore  management believes we will not be significantly affected by the implementation of this statement 
the second statement  sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  requires companies to cease amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
sfas no 
also states that acquired intangible assets should be separately recognized upon meeting certain criteria 
such intangible assets include  but are not limited to  trade and service marks  noncompete agreements  and customer lists 
intangible assets that have indefinite lives will not be amortized  but instead will be subject to an impairment test 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning january  with the exception that goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  will not be subject to amortization 
impairment reviews may result in future periodic write downs in the period in which the impairment took place 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no

in general  fin no

in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no

sab no 
summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the adoption of sab no 
in the fourth quarter of did not have a material affect on our financial position or results of operations 
inflation in recent years  health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate 
to reduce the effect of health care cost inflation we have  where possible  increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective 
outlook we traditionally have an organic membership growth target of 
however  due to the loss of a large group in wichita  a soft economy  and increased unemployment  will likely be closer to across all segments 
we operate in highly competitive markets  but generally believe that the pricing environment is improving in our existing markets  thus creating the opportunity for reasonable price increases 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to increase premiums at rates equal to or in excess of increases in our health care costs 
for  we will continue to pursue ways to improve our underwriting processes and oversight in both risk and management services products with the objective of increasing premium yields and profitable growth in all of our markets 
our migration of certain of our operating activities eg  customer service  claims processing  billing and enrollment to regional service centers is expected to provide improved levels of service in a more cost effective manner 
management believes that existing markets have potential for growth for our commercial and governmental products 
management believes that the foregoing should result in progressive improvements in  although realization is dependent upon a variety of factors  some of which may be outside of our control 
risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
further  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
most of the premium revenue we receive is based upon rates set months before we deliver services 
as a result  our results of operations largely depend on our ability to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
we base the premiums we charge  at least in part  on our estimate of expected health care costs over the applicable premium period 
factors that may cause health care costs to exceed our estimates include an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies  including pharmaceuticals  higher than expected utilization of health care services  periodic renegotiation of hospital  physician and other provider contracts  the occurrence of catastrophes or epidemics  changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them  general inflation or economic downturns  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs  and other unforeseen occurrences 
in addition  medical claims payable in our financial statements include our estimated reserves for incurred but not reported and unpaid claims  which we call ibnr 
the estimates for submitted claims and ibnr are made on an accrual basis 
we believe that our reserves for ibnr are adequate to satisfy our medical claims liabilities  but we cannot assure you of this 
any adjustments to our ibnr reserves could adversely affect our results of operations 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
our results of operations depend on our ability to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
although we attempt to base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs  we may not be able to control the premiums we charge as a result of competition  government regulations and other factors 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to set premium rates at appropriate levels or adjust premium rates in the event our health care costs increase 
a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include reductions in the number of employers offering health care coverage  reductions in work force by existing customers  increases in premiums or benefit changes  benefit changes or reductions in premiums by our competitors  our exit from a market or the termination of a health plan  and negative publicity and news coverage relating to our company or the managed health care industry generally 
our growth strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to acquire additional health plans and successfully integrate those plans into our operations 
an important part of our growth strategy is to grow through the acquisition of additional health plans 
during the last several years  we have significantly increased our membership through a number of acquisitions  including the acquisition of certain health plans from principal in april we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to locate suitable acquisition candidates  successfully integrate the plans we acquire and realize anticipated operational improvements and cost savings 
the plans we acquire also may not achieve our anticipated levels of profitability 
our future growth rate will be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions 
competition in our industry may limit our ability to attract new members or to increase or maintain our premium rates  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that may affect our ability to attract new members and increase premium rates 
we compete with other health plans for members 
we believe the principal factors influencing the choice among health care options are price of benefits offered  location and choice of health care providers  quality of customer service  comprehensiveness of coverage offered  reputation for quality care  financial stability of the plan  and diversity of product offerings 
we face competition from other managed care companies  hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers that may have broader geographical coverage  more established reputations in our markets  greater market share  lower costs and greater financial and other resources 
we depend on the services of non exclusive independent agents and brokers to market our products to employers  and we cannot assure you that they will continue to market our products in the future 
we depend on the services of independent agents and brokers to market our managed care products and services  particularly to small employer group members 
we do not have long term contracts with independent agents and brokers  and they typically are not dedicated exclusively to us and frequently market the health care products of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers  and we cannot assure you that agents and brokers will continue to market our products at reasonable costs 
our failure to obtain cost effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers may result in higher medical costs and a decrease in our membership 
our future results largely depend on our ability to enter into cost effective agreements with hospitals  physicians and other health care providers 
the terms of those provider contracts will have a material effect on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs 
in addition  our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in those markets 
in some of our markets  there are large provider systems that have a major presence 
some of these large provider systems have operated their own health plans in the past or may choose to do so in the future 
these provider systems could adversely affect our product offerings and results of operations if they refuse to contract with us  place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are less favorable to us 
provider agreements are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation 
we cannot assure you that these large provider systems will continue to contract with us or that they will contract with us on terms that are favorable to us 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular could adversely affect our results of operations 
over the last several years  the managed health care industry has been subject to negative publicity 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices  which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to change our products and services  increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate  or adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services 
negative publicity relating to our company or the managed care industry generally also may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain members 
a failure of our information systems could adversely affect our business 
we depend on our information systems for timely and accurate information 
failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or disruptions in our information systems could cause disruptions in our business operations  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  increases in administrative expenses and other adverse consequences 
compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the use of patient data by all of our businesses is regulated at the federal  state and local level 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  for example  imposed significant new requirements relating to maintaining the privacy of medical information 
the government published regulations to implement these provisions in december health plans must be in compliance by april the law is far reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continues to evolve 
consequently  our efforts to measure  monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with the law are ongoing 
because these regulations and other similar federal  state and local laws and regulations continue to evolve  we cannot guarantee that the costs of compliance will not adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to change our operations significantly 
we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in regulations or violations of regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business is heavily regulated by federal  state and local authorities 
legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we currently do business may in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations 
legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include changes that impose increased liability for adverse consequences of medical decisions  limit premium levels  increase minimum capital  reserves and other financial viability requirements  impose fines or other penalties for the failure to pay claims promptly  prohibit or limit rental access to health care provider networks  prohibit or limit provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements  require health plans to offer expanded or new benefits  limit the ability of health plans to manage care and utilization due to any willing provider and direct access laws that restrict or prohibit product features that encourage members to seek services from contracted providers or through referral by a primary care provider  limit contractual terms with providers  including audit  payment and termination provisions  and implement mandatory third party review processes for coverage denials 
in addition  we are required to obtain and maintain various regulatory approvals to market many of our products 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely impact our results of operations 
federal  state and local authorities frequently consider changes to laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 
we cannot predict the changes that government authorities will approve in the future or assure you that those changes will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we face periodic reviews  audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies  and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business 
we contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services 
pursuant to these contracts  we are subject to various governmental reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
any adverse review  audit or investigation could result in refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts  imposition of fines  penalties and other sanctions on us  loss of our right to participate in various federal programs  damage to our reputation in various markets  increased difficulty in selling our products and services  and loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer or hmo or to otherwise provide a service 
we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories  that could significantly affect our results of operations 
due to the nature of our business  we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including claims relating to our denial of health care benefits  vicarious liability for our actions or medical malpractice claims  disputes with our providers over compensation and termination of provider contracts  disputes related to our non risk business  including actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties  claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements  disputes over our copayment calculations  and customer audits of our compliance with our plan obligations 
in addition  plaintiffs continue to bring new types of purported legal claims against managed care companies 
recent court decisions and legislative activity increase our exposure to these types of claims 
in some cases  plaintiffs may seek class action status and substantial economic  non economic or punitive damages 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it resulted in a significant damage award  could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
this risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain 
we cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on the managed care industry in general or on us in particular 
we currently have  and expect to maintain  liability insurance coverage for some of the potential legal liabilities we may incur 
potential liabilities that we incur may not  however  be covered by insurance  our insurers may dispute coverage  our insurers may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future  or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost effective basis  if at all 
our stock price and trading volume may be volatile 
from time to time  the price and trading volume of our common stock  as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry may experience periods of significant volatility 
company specific issues and developments generally in the health care industry including the regulatory environment and the capital markets may cause this volatility 
our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  including quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in the market s expectations about our future operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care industry generally  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  news reports relating to trends in our markets  changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business  acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry  and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders  or the perception that such sales could occur 
our indebtedness will impose restrictions on our business and operations 
the indenture for our senior notes  which were issued on february   imposes restrictions on our business and operations 
these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  create or permit certain liens on our assets  sell assets  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  which may impose further restrictions on us 
the restrictions in the indenture for our senior notes and in any future debt instruments could limit  among other things  our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs  make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities 
we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the senior notes upon a change of control 
in the event of a change of control of our company  we will be required  subject to certain conditions  to offer to purchase all of our outstanding senior notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase 
it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the senior notes or that restrictions in any other debt instruments may not allow such repurchases 
our failure to purchase the senior notes would be a default under the indenture governing the senior notes 
even if we are able to repurchase the senior notes in the event of a change of control  the use of our cash resources to complete the repurchase may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay  discourage or prevent a change in control of our company that our stockholders consider favorable

in addition  provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may delay  discourage or prevent a merger  acquisition or change in control involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable

and sfas no 

accordingly  a transition gain of million  net of tax  based on the valuation at december   was recorded in the first quarter of related to one financial instrument classified as derivative in nature 
we do not typically invest in derivative financial instruments 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
these policies include an emphasis on credit quality  management of portfolio duration  maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending upon market conditions 
we have classified all of our investments as available for sale 
the fair value of our investments at december  was million 
our investments at december  mature according to their contractual terms  as follows  in thousands actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights amortized fair cost value as of december  maturities within year   to years   to years   over years   total short term and long term securities   we believe our investment portfolio is diversified and expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuer of the debt securities we holds 
the mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations  including government national mortgage administration and federal national mortgage administration 
our projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments  should potential changes in market rates occur  are presented below 
the analysis is based on a hypothetical change in interest rates of  and basis points 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses 
gains or losses would be realized upon the sale of these investments 
while we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible  actual results may differ 
increase decrease in fair value of portfolio given an interest rate decrease increase of x basis points in thousands
