item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we manufacture  recycle  market and distribute steel and metal products through a network of over locations in the united states and internationally 
manufacturing operations we conduct our manufacturing operations through the following o steel mills  commonly referred to as minimills  that produce reinforcing bar  angles  flats  small beams  rounds  fence post sections and other shapes o steel plants that bend  cut and fabricate steel  primarily reinforcing bar and angles o plant that produces copper tubing o warehouses that sell or rent supplies for the installation of concrete o plants that produce special sections for floors and ceiling support o plants that produce steel fence posts o plant that treats steel with heat to strengthen and provide flexibility o plant that rebuilds railcars o railroad salvage company recycling operations we conduct our recycling operations through metal processing plants located in the states of texas  south carolina  florida  north carolina  oklahoma  kansas  missouri  tennessee  louisiana and georgia 
marketing and distribution operations we market and distribute steel  copper and aluminum coil  sheet and tubing  ores  metal concentrates  industrial minerals  ferro alloys and chemicals through our network of marketing and distribution offices  processing facilities and joint ventures around the world 
our customers use these products in a variety of industries 
you should read this management s discussion and analysis in connection with your review of our consolidated audited financial statements and the accompanying footnotes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following are important accounting policies  estimates and assumptions that you should understand as you review our financial statements 
we apply these accounting policies and make these estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles 
our use of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions affects our results of operations and our reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
where we have used estimates or assumptions  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition generally  we recognize sales when title passes 
for a few of our steel fabrication operations  we recognize net sales and profits from certain long term fixed price contracts by the percentage of completion method 
in determining the amount of net sales to recognize  we estimate the total costs and profits expected to be recorded for the contract term  and the recoverability of costs related to change orders 
these estimates could change  resulting in changes in our earnings 
contingencies we make accruals as needed for litigation  administrative proceedings  government investigations  including environmental matters  and contract disputes 
we base our environmental liabilities on estimates regarding the number of sites for which we will be responsible  the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site  the portion of costs that we expect we will share with other parties and the timing of the remediation 
where timing of expenditures can be reliably estimated  we discount amounts to reflect our cost of capital over time 
we record these and other contingent liabilities when they are probable and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
where timing and amounts cannot be precisely estimated  we estimate a range  and we recognize the low end of the range without undiscounting 
also  see footnote  commitments and contingencies  in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended august  inventory cost we determine inventory cost for most domestic inventories by the last in  first out method  or lifo 
at the end of each quarter  we estimate both inventory quantities and costs that we expect at the end of the fiscal year for these lifo calculations  and we record an amount on a pro rata basis 
these estimates could vary substantially from the actual year end results  causing an adjustment to cost of goods sold 
see footnote  quarterly financial data  to the consolidated financial statements 
we record all inventories at the lower of their cost or market value 
property  plant and equipment our manufacturing and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
we evaluate the value of these assets and other long lived assets whenever a change in circumstances indicates that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
some of the estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce 
if these assets were for sale  our estimates of their values could be significantly different because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
also  we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on our estimate of the assets economically useful lives 
to the extent that an asset s actual life differs from our estimate  there could be an impact on depreciation expense or a gain loss on the disposal of the asset in a later period 
we expense major maintenance costs as incurred 
other accounting policies for additional information on our accounting policies  see footnote  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements see footnote  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations as discussed in footnote  restatement of prior periods  we have restated the and financial statements and the and financial information included in our management s discussion and analysis 
year ended august  in millions except share data net sales    net earnings cash flows international sales as of total lifo effect on net earnings expense income per diluted share lifo reserve of inventory on lifo before changes in operating assets and liabilities adjusted for stock split our results in fiscal reflect the impact of significant external factors 
our fiscal year began on september   only days before the september terrorist attacks  which dramatically affected united states commercial activity 
capital markets also suffered during our fiscal period due to the collapse of the technology market bubble and corporate financial and accounting scandals 
following signs of an economic recovery during the first calendar quarter of  the growth of the us economy instead slowed during the second and third calendar quarters 
economic activity also lost momentum in most global markets  perhaps except for non japan asia 
our results reflect notable weakness in business investment 
we saw big declines in key markets such as nonresidential construction spending for factories  offices and other commercial buildings 
public works outlays for institutional buildings  highways and bridges remained strong  but did not offset reduced expenditures in the private sector 
residential construction activity fell  although it remains at a historically high level 
hotel motel building also fell 
consequently  we experienced lower margins in our manufacturing segment  especially during our fiscal fourth quarter 
the weakening of the us dollar during the latter part of our fiscal year helped our results  although the impact was not as strong as we expected 
we believe that one reason is that world production and supply of many steel products and nonferrous metals remained excessive 
during fiscal  the us government implemented tariffs on imported steel products that compete with most of the products manufactured by our minimills 
however  because production by our us competitors remained constant  we have not seen a significant increase in prices 
conditions in our important end use markets generally showed little improvement and in some instances deteriorated 
the following financial events were significant this year earnings were much higher than  even excluding the million after tax litigation accrual recorded last year in the manufacturing segment 
at year end  we had no short term financing needs and had  in fact  significant temporary investments 
steel minimill earnings were higher in due to increased production and shipments in spite of lower selling prices and higher scrap costs 
during the current year  our steel group received a nonrecurring graphite electrode litigation settlement of million after tax 
our steel group realized a million after tax gain from the sale of the assets of smi owen steel company in we discovered a theft and accounting fraud and accounting errors at two rebar fabrication operations totalling million after tax 
see footnote  restatement of prior periods  to the consolidated financial statements 
copper tube profits decreased in spite of record production and shipments because of lower selling prices and margins 
our recycling segment returned to profitability during mostly due to the recently improved ferrous scrap market 
our marketing and distribution group s profit was higher than last year  but some markets remained weak 
our acquisition of the coil steels group in september significantly contributed to profits 
financing costs decreased due to lower requirements  reduced interest rates and the beneficial effect of an interest rate swap 
a lower effective income tax rate  due primarily to the favorable completion of irs audits  added million to net earnings in segments unless otherwise indicated  all dollars below are pre tax 
financial results for our reportable segments are consistent with the basis and manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information for making operating decisions 
we have three reportable segments manufacturing  recycling  and marketing and distribution 
the following table shows net sales and operating profit loss by business segment 
our operating profit loss  as presented below  is the sum of our earnings loss before income taxes  interest expense owed to third parties and discounts on the sales of accounts receivable 
year ended august  in millions net sales manufacturing    recycling marketing and distribution operating profit loss manufacturing recycling marketing and distribution compared to manufacturing we include our steel group and our copper tube division in our manufacturing segment 
our manufacturing operating profit in increased million as compared to on marginally more million net sales 
we achieved this increase in operating profit for two primary reasons in i the nonrecurrence of the prior year litigation accrual in the amount of million  and ii the current year gain on the sale of the steel group s heavy structural fabrication operation  smi owen  in the amount of million 
excluding those items  our manufacturing segment s operating profit was slightly higher than last year 
increased production and shipments at our steel group s minimills more than offset lower selling prices  increased scrap purchase costs and lower copper tube earnings 
also  we spent less in on utilities  and we recorded lower depreciation and amortization expense 
however  fiscal was not a good year in the steel group s downstream steel fabrication and related businesses due to lower profits in rebar fabrication and structural steel fabrication  excluding smi owen 
the table below reflects steel and scrap prices per ton august  dollars per ton average mill selling price total sales average mill selling price finished goods only average fabrication selling price average ferrous scrap purchase price minimills during  operating profit for our four steel minimills rose compared with  despite lower selling prices 
smi south carolina had a million profit in compared to a million loss in smi alabama turned around as well with a million profit in compared to a million loss in profits at smi arkansas were up in the current year period 
these improvements more than offset a decline in profits at smi texas as compared to a major reason for the minimills improved profitability was a increase in shipments because of continued public projects infrastructure construction 
shipments were  tons in compared to  in mill production also increased over last year 
tons rolled were up to  in tons melted were up to  in even though demand was strong  the average total mill selling price at per ton was below last year 
also  in  we sold more semi finished billets  a product with a lower selling price than our average 
average scrap purchase costs were per ton higher than in  resulting in smaller margins 
utility expenses declined by million as compared to decreases in natural gas costs more than offset higher electricity costs 
also  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by million in  primarily because smi south carolina fully depreciated its mill rolls and guides as well as certain melt shop equipment 
the mills also received million from a nonrecurring graphite electrode litigation settlement in the us government s new tariffs cover most of the steel minimills products and range from the first year  declining over the next two years 
an import licensing and monitoring system and an anti surge mechanism will further strengthen these remedies 
also  the us administration plans to continue discussions with other steel producing nations to remove excess global capacity and eliminate subsidies 
fabrication and other businesses operating profit in the steel group s fabrication and other businesses increased by million in as compared to excluding the gain on the sale of smi owen million and the litigation accrual million  operating profits in decreased by million as compared to near the end of fiscal  we discovered two significant  but unrelated events  requiring retroactive writedowns at two rebar fabrication operations 
the total amount of the adjustments required to correct the august  balance sheets of these two facilities was million 
these adjustments affect four fiscal years from to in august  we uncovered a theft and an accounting fraud which occurred over four years at a rebar fabrication plant in south carolina 
the total adjustment required to revert the accounting records to their proper balances was million 
in september  we discovered accounting errors related to losses on rebar fabrication and placement jobs at one facility in california  some of which date back to its acquisition in fiscal the resulting charge was million 
the south carolina incident resulted in a thousand expense in fiscal the remaining million for both instances was attributed thousand to fiscal  million to fiscal  and thousand to  resulting in prior period adjustments to these previously reported financial statements 
we have taken immediate action to strengthen compliance with our internal control policies 
fabrication plant shipments totaled  tons  down fractionally from  tons shipped in the average fabrication selling price in decreased per ton as compared to rebar fabrication markets were softer in as a result of intense competition  and several plants reported losses 
during the fourth quarter  we acquired the real estate  equipment  inventory and work in process of varmicon  inc in harlingen  texas 
we now operate this rebar fabrication facility under the name of smi valley steel 
the steel joist operations  which includes cellular and castellated beams  were breakeven in  an improvement over the loss in both prices and shipments decreased  but lower operating costs and shop efficiencies helped significantly 
also  in these operations incurred million in start up costs 
structural steel fabrication profits  excluding smi owen and the prior year litigation accrual  were down in compared to however  our concrete related products operations were more profitable in we continued to expand this business through the acquisition in the fourth quarter of dowel assembly manufacturing company  or damco  in jackson  mississippi 
damco manufactures dowel baskets and has an epoxy coating business 
in  the steel group started spray forming international  a stainless steel cladding operation located in south carolina 
spray forming international will use a patented process to produce stainless clad billets 
copper tube our copper tube division s operating profit decreased with less net sales as compared to copper tube shipments increased from to a record million pounds  and production increased from to a record million pounds 
however  average sales prices dropped in compared to the biggest factor was lower apartment and hotel motel construction 
consequently  demand for plumbing and refrigeration tube was not as strong 
the product mix included increased quantities of hvac products and line sets 
in the marketplace  we continued to adapt to the consolidation among our buyers 
the difference between sales price and copper scrap purchase cost commonly referred to as the metal spread  declined in compared to lower raw material purchase costs did not fully compensate for the decline in selling prices 
recycling our recycling segment reported an operating profit of million in compared with an operating loss of million in net sales in were lower at million as compared to however  gross margins were above last year  primarily because we shipped more total tons 
demand for ferrous scrap improved both in the us and internationally 
the segment processed and shipped  tons of ferrous scrap in  more than in ferrous sales prices were on average per ton  an increase of from nonferrous shipments were flat at  tons 
the average nonferrous scrap sales price of per ton was lower than in increased productivity  higher asset turnover and reduced costs contributed to the improved results 
the total volume of scrap processed  including the steel group s processing plants  was  tons  an increase of from the  tons processed in in june  we acquired most of the transportation assets of sampson steel corporation in beaumont  texas 
these assets will be combined with our existing scrap processing facility in beaumont 
earlier in the year we closed our midland  texas facility  resulting in a writedown of  on certain equipment 
marketing and distribution net sales in for our marketing and distribution segment increased to million as compared to operating profit in increased to million as compared to  mostly due to better results from our australian operations 
international steel prices and volumes for steel and nonferrous semifinished products improved during the second half of  primarily in the distribution and processing businesses 
however  depressed economies  oversupply in most markets and intense competition from domestic suppliers in the respective markets caused compressed margins for numerous steel products  nonferrous metal products and industrial raw materials and products 
the us dollar weakened against major currencies  a beneficial development 
in september  we completed our acquisition of coil steels group  an australian service center in which we already owned a share 
this acquisition provided million of additional profits and million in net sales during sales and profits for the company s pre existing business in australia also improved significantly 
however  this increase in net sales was more than offset by decreased sales in our us operations due to fewer imports into the united states 
operating profits for the us divisions improved significantly due to cometals which returned to more historical levels  and dallas trading which benefited from the us tariff legislation 
lower margins at commonwealth on semi finished products almost offset these improvements 
our european operations net sales decreased slightly in as compared to  but profits improved significantly 
the segment s recent strategy of growing its downstream marketing and distribution business offset the continuing very difficult trading conditions 
other selling  general and administration as well as employee s retirement plans expenses were higher in as compared to  mostly due to the acquisition of coil steels group and discretionary items  such as bonuses and profit sharing 
this increase was consistent with the improvement in our operating profitability 
interest expense decreased by million from largely due to lower interest rates and much lower average short term borrowings 
also  during we entered into two interest rate swaps see footnote  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements which resulted in interest expense savings 
during  we favorably resolved all issues for our federal income tax returns through due to the lack of any material adjustments  we have reevaluated the tax accruals and  consequently  reduced the net tax expense by million during near term outlook we expect that fiscal will be weaker than the global economy slowed in amid considerable uncertainty  and economic growth in the united states remains slow and uneven 
our specific markets reflect the soft demand and remain very competitive 
the outlook for our markets generally is weaker  in some cases significantly so 
the manufacturing sector continues to grow slowly 
we do not expect private  nonresidential construction to improve before mid calendar year  but we expect public construction to hold steady 
residential building slowed in  but housing sales and starts remain at a historically high level because of the lowest mortgage rates in three decades 
economic growth outside the united states also slowed  especially in europe 
on the other hand  most analysts don t expect the global economy to fall into a double dip recession 
the fiscal quarterly results are likely to be erratic and the first half of fiscal could be relatively weak 
in addition to market conditions  we face a number of other challenges including increased insurance costs and higher energy costs 
by segment  we anticipate a decrease in operating profit for manufacturing  little change in recycling and an increase in marketing and distribution 
we expect fiscal diluted earnings per share to decrease because diluted average shares will rise further 
our balance sheet should remain strong 
during  we had capital spending of million plus million for the acquisition of the remaining shares of coil steels group  compared to capital spending of million in fiscal we have focused on reducing short term financing needs during the past two fiscal years 
we plan to increase capital expenditures to million for fiscal fiscal capital expenditures will include expansion in downstream rebar fabrication and concrete related products operations in the steel group and the acquisition of the flat rolled assets of horans  a small service center in australia 
we have no major projects planned at the steel mills for fiscal  only smaller enhancements and maintenance expenditures 
all segments will continue to focus on improving or disposing of under performing operations  especially if they no longer fit our strategic direction 
long term outlook we are well positioned to exploit long term opportunities 
our challenge is to continue growing in a manner which increases our earnings per share and return on capital and generates free cash flows over time 
further consolidation is a virtual certainty in the industries in which we participate  and we plan to participate in a prudent way 
the reasons for further consolidation include an inadequate return on capital for most companies  numerous bankruptcies  a high degree of fragmentation  the need to eliminate non competitive capacity and more effective marketing 
the outlook section contains forward looking statements regarding the outlook for our financial results including net earnings  product pricing and demand  production rates  energy expense  insurance expense  interest rates  inventory levels  acquisitions and general market conditions 
these forward looking statements can generally be identified by phrases such as we or our management expects  anticipates  believes  plans to  ought  could  should  likely  appears  projects  forecasts  or other similar words or phrases 
there is inherent risk and uncertainty in any forward looking statements 
variances will occur and some could be materially different from our current opinion 
developments that could impact our expectations include the following o interest rate changes o construction activity o litigation claims and settlements o difficulties or delays in the execution of construction contracts resulting in cost overruns or contract disputes o metals pricing over which we exert little influence o increased capacity and product availability from competing steel minimills and other steel suppliers including import quantities and pricing o court decisions o industry consolidation or changes in production capacity or utilization o global factors including credit availability o currency fluctuations o energy and insurance prices o decisions by governments impacting the level of steel imports and the pace of overall economic activity 
compared to segments manufacturing our manufacturing net sales for for the manufacturing segment decreased by compared to despite an increase in both mill and fabrication shipments  net sales decreased due to lower selling prices 
operating profit as restated decreased million in as compared to the adverse charge for litigation of million caused more than half of the decrease 
also  copper tube profits dropped from their record levels in steel group profits  excluding the litigation accrual  decreased slightly as well 
we recorded pre tax lifo income of million in compared to lifo expense of million in  primarily in the manufacturing segment 
august  dollars per ton average mill selling price total sales average mill selling price finished goods only average fab selling price average ferrous scrap purchase price minimills our steel minimills recovered in the second half of despite very weak markets throughout the year 
the four steel mills operating profit decreased as compared to an operating loss at the alabama mill and lower profits in texas and arkansas contributed significantly to the decrease 
the lower profits were partially offset by significantly lower losses at south carolina 
tons melted and rolled decreased to and million tons  respectively 
shipments rose by to million tons 
the average mill selling price decreased in as compared to the average selling price for finished goods decreased per ton in as compared to the average scrap purchase cost for the mills decreased per ton in  which offset the decreases in selling prices 
however  utility costs rose million as compared to import levels and more aggressive competition caused sales prices to drop 
excluding prior year graphite electrode settlements  operating profit in at smi texas decreased and at smi arkansas decreased as compared to smi alabama reported an operating loss in as compared to an operating profit in the price drops especially hurt smi alabama 
record shipments at the smi south carolina mill caused losses to decrease by million in to million this mill was profitable in the second half of selling prices continued to be significantly lower  and utility and scrap purchase costs were down as well 
fabrication and other businesses in  our downstream steel fabrication businesses had another solid year 
we have restated operating results by thousand for the accounting fraud at the south carolina rebar facility 
also  we reduced fiscal operating profits by thousand and million  respectively  for the accounting fraud at the south carolina rebar facility and the accounting errors at the california rebar manufacturing and placement operation 
we discovered both events near the end of fiscal excluding a net pre tax gain of million from the sale of land and improvements in fiscal  net sales remained the same in as compared to operating profits increased as compared to  excluding the litigation accrual of million for an adverse court ruling and the million gain on the sale 
fabricated steel shipments of  tons increased as compared to  however  this included new capacity 
although prices were mixed  the annual average fab selling price remained unchanged 
steel joist and cellular beam manufacturing operations incurred million in startup costs for four projects 
a major turnaround in large structural steel jobs fabricated by smi owen more than offset these costs 
copper tube our copper tube division s operating profit decreased in as compared to shipments decreased less than in to million pounds  and metal spreads declined in as compared to production at the plant decreased consistently with shipments 
although the housing sector of the us economy remained relatively strong  demand for plumbing and refrigeration tube was softer than in the prior year 
in the second half of  we added line sets to our product mix  although shipments of this new product were not yet significant 
capital improvements our capital improvements decreased significantly to million as compared to million in  primarily in the manufacturing segment 
the million included the expansion at the copper tube mill and the installation of a ladle metallurgical station at smi south carolina 
in fiscal  we substantially completed the copper tube mill expansion 
recycling our recycling segment incurred an operating loss of million in as compared to a million operating profit in tons processed and shipped decreased as compared to  however  net sales decreased as compared to due to high scrap imports  weak domestic steel mills and the strong us dollar  ferrous prices fell per ton as compared to per ton in  and shipments fell 
a sharp drop in terminal market values resulted in lower nonferrous margins 
the average nonferrous scrap price was lower on volumes which were higher as compared to increased productivity  high asset turnover and reduced expenses mitigated the effects of weak markets 
the total volume of scrap processed and shipped in  including our steel group operations  decreased slightly to million tons from million tons in fiscal marketing and distribution our marketing and distribution segment s net sales decreased in by to million  and operating profits were lower as compared to depressed global economies  oversupply in most markets and intense competition from domestic suppliers in the respective markets contributed significantly to the decline 
also  the strong us dollar continued to hamper the segment s results in various parts of the world 
margins were compressed for most steel products  nonferrous metal products and industrial raw materials and products 
our strategy in recent years to enhance regional businesses helped in the difficult market and currency conditions 
most importantly  we achieved profitability even as we continued a major commitment to develop quality people in sales and administration to provide for long term growth 
we continued to diversify and build business by adding product and geographic areas 
we expanded regional trade as well  and continued to increase our operations in the processing of the materials and products we buy and sell 
liquidity and capital resources we discuss liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis 
our discussion includes the sources and uses of our three operating segments and centralized corporate functions 
we have a centralized treasury function and use inter company loans to efficiently manage the short term cash needs of our operating divisions 
we invest any excess funds centrally 
we rely upon cash flows from operating activities  and to the extent necessary  external short term financing sources 
our short term financing sources include the issuance of commercial paper  sales of accounts receivable and borrowing under our bank credit facilities 
from time to time  we have issued long term public debt 
our investment grade credit ratings and general business conditions affect our access to external financing on a cost effective basis 
depending on the price of our common stock  we may realize significant cash flows from the exercise of stock options 
moody s investors service p  standard poor s corporation a and fitch f rate our million commercial paper program  which is up from million in  in the second highest category 
to support our commercial paper program  we have unsecured revolving credit agreements with a group of eight banks 
our million facility expires in august and our million facility expires in august we plan to continue our commercial paper program and the revolving credit agreements in comparable amounts to support the commercial paper program 
for added flexibility  we may secure financing from the sale of certain accounts receivable in an amount not to exceed million 
we continually sell accounts receivable on an ongoing basis to replace those receivables that we have collected from our customers 
our long term public debt  which was million at august   is investment grade rated by standard poor s corporation bbb  fitch bbb and by moody s investors services baa 
we have access to the public markets for potential refinancing or the issuance of additional long term debt 
also  we have numerous informal  uncommitted credit facilities available from domestic and international banks 
these credit facilities are priced at bankers acceptance rates or on a cost of funds basis 
credit ratings affect our ability to obtain short and long term financing and the cost of such financing 
if the rating agencies were to reduce our credit ratings  we would pay higher financing costs and possibly would have less availability of the informal  uncommitted facilities 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors 
such factors include earnings  fixed charges such as interest  cash flows  total debt outstanding  off balance sheet obligations and other commitments  total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors 
the rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows  business strategy  industry condition and contingencies 
we are committed to maintaining our investment grade credit ratings 
certain of our financing agreements include various covenants 
the most restrictive of these covenants requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio of greater than three times and a debt to capitalization ratio of as defined in the financing agreement 
a few of the agreements provide that if we default on the terms of another financing agreement  it is considered a default under these agreements 
we have complied with the requirements  including the covenants of our financing agreement as of and for the year ended  august  our unsecured revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable securitization agreement include ratings triggers 
the trigger in the revolving credit agreements is solely a means to reset pricing for facility fees and  if a borrowing occurs  on loans 
within the accounts receivable securitization agreement  the ratings trigger is contained in a termination event  but the trigger is set at catastrophic levels 
the trigger requires a combination of ratings actions on behalf of two independent rating agencies and is set at levels seven ratings categories below our current rating 
our manufacturing and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
our capital requirements include construction  purchases of equipment and maintenance capital at existing facilities 
we plan to invest in new operations 
we also plan to invest in working capital to support the growth of our businesses  maintain our ability to repay maturing long term debt when due at its earliest maturity in and pay dividends to our stockholders 
our management continues to assess alternative means of raising capital  including potential dispositions of under performing or non strategic assets 
any potential future major acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources such as the sale of common stock 
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities primarily result from sales of steel and related products and  to a lesser extent  from sales of nonferrous metal products 
we have a diverse and generally stable customer base 
we use futures or forward contracts as needed to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and metals commodity prices see footnote  financial instruments  market and credit risk  in the consolidated financial statements 
the volume and price of the orders from our us customers in the manufacturing and construction sectors affect our cash flows from operating activities 
our international marketing and distribution operations also significantly affect our cash flows from operating activity 
the weather can influence the volume of products we ship in any given period 
also  the general economy  the strength of the us dollar  governmental action  and various other factors beyond our control influence our volumes and prices 
these periodic fluctuations in our prices and volumes can result in variations in cash flows from operations 
despite these fluctuations  we have historically relied on operating activities as a steady source of cash 
cash flows from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities in increased to million from million in due mostly to higher earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in primarily because smi south carolina fully depreciated its mill rolls and guides as well as certain melt shop equipment 
we realized a million increase in the tax benefits from stock issued under option and purchase plans during our cash flows increased by million in as a result of deferred income taxes  due largely to additional depreciation which was granted under new tax legislation 
net cash flows from operating activities decreased to million in as compared to million in  primarily as a result of decreased funding from sales of accounts receivable 
net working capital in increased to million from million in  primarily due to increased temporary investments and higher receivables 
increases in accounts payable more than offset the increase in inventories 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at august   increased from at august  excluding coil steels group  csg  and smi owen  which were facilities acquired and sold in  accounts and notes receivable at august  were million more than at august  the increase resulted because we did not request as much funding from the accounts receivable that we sold to financial institutions 
excluding csg and smi owen  inventories and accounts payable  accrued expenses  other payables and income taxes at august  increased by million and million  respectively  as compared to inventories in the steel group  excluding smi owen  increased million 
the majority of the increase occurred at the minimills because of higher scrap purchase costs and higher inventory quantities 
steel fabrication and post inventories increased as well 
inventories in marketing and distribution  excluding csg  increased million in mostly due to shipments in transit and customer delays 
accounts payable in marketing and distribution  excluding csg  increased by million in due to higher inventory purchases and extended terms with vendors 
accounts payable in the steel group at the minimills increased million in also  during  we received million from a litigation settlement see footnote  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
increased profits resulted in an increase of million in income taxes payable 
during  we received million for the contract balance and settlement of disputed change orders on an old large structural steel fabrication contract at smi owen 
we invested million in property  plant and equipment in  which was million less than in in addition  in  we acquired the remaining shares of csg for million  net of cash 
we received million during for the sale of the assets of smi owen 
we expect capital spending for fiscal to be million  including both new construction and acquisitions to expand our downstream businesses 
at august   we had million in temporary investments  as compared to million at we needed much less short term financing during than during  primarily due to better management of working capital  higher earnings  the litigation settlement  the sale of smi owen and cash from stock issued under incentive and purchase plans 
these events enabled us to repay all of our short term borrowings 
in  we also made our final payment on the long term notes 
in may  our board of directors declared a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend on our common stock payable june  to our shareholders of record on june  see footnote  capital stock  to the consolidated financial statements 
on june   we issued  additional shares of common stock 
at august    shares of common stock were issued and outstanding  and  were held in our treasury 
also  we issued  additional shares of common stock during because more employees exercised stock options  and we issued more shares than last year under our employee stock purchase plan because of the significant increase in our average market price per share 
we issued all shares from treasury shares 
as a result of this activity  our cash flows increased by million in as compared to million from such activity in we paid dividends of million during  slightly more than the million we paid during on may   our directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of eight cents per share on common stock 
we paid this quarterly cash dividend on july to stockholders of record at july  this new cash dividend rate on the after split shares represents a increase in our cash dividend 
this was the st consecutive quarterly cash dividend we have paid 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity for fiscal year and the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of august  dollars in thousands payments due within after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt     operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations      total contractual cash obligations      we have not discounted the cash obligations in this table 
total amounts are included in the august  consolidated balance sheet 
see footnote  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
includes minimum lease payment obligations for noncancelable equipment and real estate leases in effect as of august  see footnote  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
about of these purchase obligations are for inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business  most of the remainder are for freight and supplies associated with normal revenue producing activities 
at august   we received  of net funding from the sales of accounts receivable 
if we terminated the accounts receivable program on august   we would have to pay the first million of collections from these accounts to third party financial institutions 
we complied with the terms of this program as of  and for the year ended august  other commercial commitments we maintain stand by letters of credit to provide support for certain transactions that our customers or suppliers request 
at august   we had committed million under these arrangements 
a cash deposit included in current other assets on the consolidated balance sheet collateralized million of these commitments 
all commitments expire within one year 
at the request of a customer and its surety bond issuer  we have agreed to indemnify the surety against all costs the surety may incur should our customer fail to perform its obligations under construction contracts covered by payment and performance bonds issued by the surety 
we are the customer primary supplier of steel  and steel is a substantial portion of our customer cost to perform the contracts 
we believe we have adequate controls to monitor the customer performance under the contracts including payment for the steel we supply 
as of august   the surety had issued bonds in the total amount without reduction for work performed to that date of  which are subject to our guaranty obligation under the indemnity agreement 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings  government investigations including environmental matters  and contract disputes 
we may incur settlement  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals we deem necessary 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our financial statements for the estimable potential impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular period 
construction contract disputes see footnote  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental and other matters we are subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations in all locations where we have operating facilities 
we anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will involve continuing capital expenditures and operating costs 
our original business and one of our core businesses for over eight decades is metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  we are committed to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  are contrary to the goal of greater recycling 
such regulations expose us and the industry to potentially significant risks 
we believe that recycled materials are commodities that are diverted by recyclers  such as us  from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
environmental agencies at various federal and state levels classify certain recycled materials as hazardous substances and subject recyclers to material remediation costs  fines and penalties 
taken to extremes  such actions could cripple the recycling industry and undermine any national goal of material conservation 
enforcement  interpretation  and litigation involving these regulations are not well developed 
the us environmental protection agency  or epa  or an equivalent state agency notified us that we are considered a potentially responsible party  or prp  at fourteen sites  none owned by us 
we may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  or cercla  or a similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
we are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting  or at the appropriate time we may contest  our liability at the sites 
in addition  we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
in fiscal  we incurred environmental expense of million 
this expense included the cost of environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessments  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
approximately thousand of our capital expenditures for related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
at august   million was accrued for environmental liabilities of which million is classified as other long term liabilities 
dividends we have paid quarterly cash dividends in each of the past consecutive years 
we paid dividends in at the rate of cents per share each quarter for the first three quarters  and cents per share for the fourth quarter

the following types of derivative instruments were outstanding at august   in accordance with our risk management program 
currency exchange forwards we enter into currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of international trade commitments denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  or  if the transaction involves our australian  united kingdom or german subsidiaries  their local currency 
no single foreign currency poses a primary risk to us 
fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 
effective september   we changed most of our european subsidiaries functional currency to the euro 
we do not anticipate that this change will have a significant impact on our financial results 
commodity prices we base pricing in some of our sales and purchase contracts on forward metal commodity exchange quotes which we determine at the beginning of the contract 
due to the volatility of the metal commodity indexes  we enter into metal commodity forward or futures contracts for copper  aluminum and zinc 
these forwards or futures mitigate the risk of unanticipated declines in gross margins on these contractual commitments 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to small gains and losses from ineffectiveness 
interest rate swaps see footnote  credit arrangements  regarding our strategy for managing the fluctuations in interest rates on our long term debt
