item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report on form k and the information incorporated by reference may include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
the company intends the forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements 
all statements regarding the company s expected financial position and operating results  its business strategy  its financing plans and the outcome of any contingencies are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are based on current estimates and projections about our industry and our business 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth or implied by any forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to the inability to manage our recent rapid growth  unforeseen environmental liabilities and the uncertain military  political and economic conditions in the world 
these risks are detailed in part i  item risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
the company assumes no obligation to update publicly the forward looking statements contained herein  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as may be required by law 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on a regular basis  including those related to bad debts  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  and environmental contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on various factors including historical experience  consultation and advice from third party subject matter experts and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances  which could have a significant impact on the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title to the customer 
such revenues do not involve difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
the company does not offer product warranties to its customers 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers and industries in which the customers operate 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
the company writes down its inventories for estimated slow moving and obsolete goods equal to the difference between the carrying cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a significant sudden increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may have understated or overstated the write down required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued  it would be required to recognize such costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if the company does not properly estimate the lower of cost or market of its inventory and it is therefore determined to be undervalued  it may have over reported its cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and its reported operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets consist of assets arising from acquisitions which are being amortized on a straight line basis 
the realizability and amortization period of goodwill is evaluated whenever an indication of impairment exists 
the company is required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective july  under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
the company establishes reserves for environmental matters and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
if the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than has been accrued  or the company s share of the contingency increases or decreases  or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change  we would recognize an additional expense or benefit in income in the period such determination was made 
the company determines a need for a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

the pharmaceuticals  biochemicals nutritionals segment sales were  in fiscal and  in  an increase of  or 
this segment now represents the largest segment of the company in both net sales and gross profit 
the acquisition in march contributed sales of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the segment s sales  excluding the schweizerhall pharma portion  were  in versus  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was a direct result of increased volume in one generic pharmaceutical product and the initial shipments of several generic pharmaceutical products which have been in development for the past several years 
the nutritionals business showed a slight decline in versus due to softer demand for nutritional supplements 
the chemicals colorants segment saw an overall decrease of  or  to  in from  in this decrease reflects a general slowdown in the economy and in the entire industrial chemical market 
also  the shrinking dye stuff industry in the united states caused sales to decline 
in addition  the pigment industry has had economic difficulties  with the advertising sector in particular  resulting in decreased demand 
pharmaceutical intermediates custom manufacturing reported sales of  for versus  last year  an increase of  or 
schweizerhall pharma sales were  in and  in  an increase of  the segment s sales excluding the effect of the acquisition are  for and  for  an increase of or 
this increase is attributable to increased sales volume from the introduction of new products  especially in the fourth quarter  which was somewhat offset by lost sales from this segment s former primary supplier 
that supplier terminated a supply agreement in october agrochemicals sales were  compared to  an increase of or 
a restructuring of the company s arrangement with a third party resulted in additional sales of  during the year ended june  excluding this  sales decreased by  or 
the primary causes were a reduction of sales to one large customer as well as an overall decline in demand 
institutional sanitary supplies other sales were  for versus  last year  a decrease of or 
the decline was attributable to an overall decline in demand due to the general economic slowdown in the united states during this past year 
this segment was also specifically disrupted by the after effects on the economy from the terrorist attacks of september  over of this segment s customer base is in the new york metropolitan area 
gross profit by segment before unallocated cost of sales primarily storage and certain freight costs increased  to  from  the inclusion of schweizerhall pharma  again in the pharmaceuticals  biochemicals and nutritionals segment  and to a lesser extent  the pharmaceutical intermediates and custom manufacturing segment  accounted for  in and  in gross profit on our continuing domestic and certain foreign sales increased  to  from  in  comparable to the increase in those sales 
the gross margins resulting from the schweizerhall pharma business in the pharmaceuticals  biochemicals and nutritionals segment amounted to  or versus  or for the rest of this segment s business 
for fiscal  the comparable gross margins were  or for the schweizerhall pharma business versus  or for all other business in the segment 
the gross margins realized from the schweizerhall pharma business in this segment are generally lower than the margins earned by our traditional business due to a different pricing and product mix 
in the pharmaceutical intermediates and custom manufacturing segment  the gross margins attributable to the schweizerhall pharma business amounted to  or in versus or in traditional business yielded gross margins of  or in versus  or in overall gross margins in are compared to last year if we adjust for the terminated supply agreement commission recorded in fiscal the agrochemicals segment showed a decline in gross profit of  which was in contrast to the increase in sales 
the restructuring of the company s arrangement referred to earlier led to an increase in sales  but the same gross profit contribution 
this is the primary cause of this discrepancy between sales and gross profit percentages for the period 
the chemicals colorants segment s gross profit declined  which was significantly higher than the decline in sales 
continued erosion of margins due to competitive pressures in many areas  particularly printing inks and electronic chemicals  caused this higher percentage decrease in margins than sales 
institutional sanitary supplies and other gross margins were in versus in the increased gross margins are a direct result of changes from a pricing review  lower costs and product mix 
unallocated cost of sales declined significantly to  from  or 
the results were achieved by lower amounts of inventory in warehouses  lower quantity sold and a negotiated reduction of storage rates paid as part of a corporate initiative 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal sg a increased primarily due to the acquisition of the distribution business of schweizerhall pharma in march sg a costs for this business increased  to  in fiscal versus  which were all recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal other factors contributing to the increase were rising employee health insurance costs  additional professional fees related to the company s tax strategy and global restructuring projects  higher office rental costs due to additional space taken  a higher bad debt provision and increased business insurance premiums 
operating profit for the year ended june  the operating profit was  compared to  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to a full year s positive contribution to operating profits from the schweizerhall pharma business  acquired on march   which was offset by higher sg a expenses 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased to for from  last year 
the reduction in income of was mainly attributable to a reduction in interest on investments of due to the holding of long term investments during last year of over  which were subsequently sold in the second half of fiscal to help finance the acquisition of schweizerhall pharma in march interest expense for was versus in the prior year 
the increase of or was entirely attributable to the short term bank loans and acquisition related debt arising from the schweizerhall pharma acquisition 
the total balance of this debt was reduced from  at june  to  at june  through debt payments totaling  tax rates the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was compared to last year s 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily a reflection of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions due to the schweizerhall pharma acquisition 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  sales and gross profit net sales for fiscal decreased  or  to  from  for fiscal although the overall sales decrease was relatively small  several of the segments showed significant changes 
the acquisition of schweizerhall pharma  which closed march   accounted for  or of net sales for of which  was in the pharmaceuticals  biochemicals nutritionals segment 
the contribution of this acquisition  offset somewhat by the loss of sales resulting from the termination of a supply agreement with a major supplier  resulted in this segment s increase  to  from  sales under the supply agreement with the major supplier that was terminated accounted for approximately million of sales in the balance of the sales resulting from that acquisition   were in the pharmaceutical intermediates custom manufacturing segment 
this segment had an overall decrease of  to  or 
the major supplier referred to earlier was the principal supplier to this segment and the sales decrease excluding the new sales from the schweizerhall pharma acquisition is directly related 
the chemicals colorants segment experienced a decrease in sales  to  from  dyes and pigment intermediates showed across the board decreases due to a general weakening of demand 
this was offset somewhat by higher industrial chemical sales as well as sales of pigments and agricultural intermediates  two relatively new areas  which showed significant growth from the continuing development of new products 
sales of the agrochemicals segment also increased to  from  or 
this was due primarily to increased sales of two products  with all other products remaining relatively flat 
the institutional sanitary supplies other segment increased or  mainly due to a full year of activity in fiscal for its magnum line which was acquired in october  which amounted to months of sales 
gross profit by segment before freight and storage costs for the entire corporation for the year increased for the year to  from  unallocated cost of sales  primarily storage and certain freight costs  increased to  from  the inclusion of schweizerhall pharma for the fourth quarter  fuel surcharges on domestic freight and increased goods in warehouses as a result of the acquisitions accounted for the increase 
therefore  since the percent increase in unallocated cost of sales was greater that the increase in total gross profit by segment  net gross profit increased by a slightly lesser percentage 
the profit margins on sales from the schweizerhall pharma acquisition in the pharmaceuticals  biochemicals and nutritional segment of  were within that segment s normal range 
this segment also benefited from the sales commission earned relating to the previously mentioned major supplier 
this accounts for the somewhat larger percentage increase in gross profit than sales 
the pharmaceutical intermediates custom manufacturing segment benefited from a sales commission earned with the aforementioned major supplier relating to profits on open orders at the time of termination 
this  coupled with the gross profit of relating to sales of this segment resulting from the schweizerhall pharma acquisition  at substantially higher gross margins than the lost sales  resulted in gross margins being virtually unchanged  in spite of the sales decrease 
the chemicals colorants sector showed a decrease in gross profit reflecting a greater percentage decrease in gross profit than sales 
this was caused by increased competition 
gross profits in the agrochemicals sector increased  greater than the increase in sales 
increased sales of higher profit products  combined with a decrease in certain product reregistration costs  caused this 
lastly  gross profits in the institutional sanitary supplies and other segment fell caused by a shift in product mix towards lower profit products 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the acquisition and inclusion of the schweizerhall pharma business as of march  accounted for  of the increase 
costs related to the acquisition and assimilation of the acquired business in addition to the related amortization of goodwill and intangible assets also contributed to the overall increase 
fiscal includes a non recurring employee separation charge of selling expenses increased due to an increased presence in china and the promotional expenses related to our recent acquisitions 
compensation related costs also increased as new positions were added to support the growth and expansion of the company 
interest and other income interest expense of in fiscal reflected an increase of from the of interest expense for the increase is a direct result of the short term loans assumed in connection with the acquisition of the schweizerhall pharma business 
interest and other income increased by to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in income was attributable to the incremental amounts realized by the schweizerhall pharma business during the fourth quarter of fiscal tax rates the effective tax rates were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory tax rate at primarily due to state income taxes

 business combinations  sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets and in august the fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all future business combinations and specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas amortization expense relating to goodwill was  and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
sfas will also require that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas the company has adopted the provisions of sfas and sfas effective july  upon adoption the company will evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations  and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill 
the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments 
in addition  the company will be required to test goodwill and  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with sfas any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as of june  the company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of  and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of the company has evaluated the remaining useful lives of its intangible assets that will continue to be amortized and has determined that no revision to the useful lives will be required 
the company expects to complete its initial impairment review of goodwill by the end of the second quarter fiscal because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate whether any transitional impairment losses associated with the company s goodwill will be required to be recognized 
b in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets in the period in which they are incurred 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas effective july  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
c sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  sfas retains the requirement of opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily controlled subsidiary 
the company has adopted sfas effective july  the adoption of sfas for long lived assets held for sale did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas is largely unchanged from sfas the provisions of this statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities and therefore  will depend on future actions initiated by management 
as a result  the company cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas will have on the consolidated financial statements with respect to future disposal decisions  if any 
d in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of sfas statements no 
  and  amendment of sfas no 
and technical corrections 
sfas updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements by rescinding statement  which required all gains and losses from extinguishments of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect

additionally  the statement requires that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july  the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
e in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas will spread out the reporting of expenses related to restructurings initiated after  because commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets will no longer be enough to record a liability for the anticipated costs 
instead  companies will record exit and disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value  and they will subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas as of january  the company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as no planned restructuring charges currently exist 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market price  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market price risk investments at june   which consist of corporate securities and are recorded at fair value of  have exposure to price risk 
this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices quoted by stock exchanges and amounts to as of june  actual results may differ 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company hedges some of its transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities 
the instruments used for hedging are short term foreign currency contracts futures 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the currency of the related hedged transactions 
at june   the company had foreign currency contracts outstanding 
the difference between the fair market value of the foreign currency contracts and the related commitments at inception and the fair market value of the contracts and the related commitments at june  was intercompany transactions with foreign subsidiaries are typically not hedged 
therefore  the potential loss in fair value for a net currency position resulting from a adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of june  is not applicable 
the company is subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for its subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
on june   the company had translation exposure to various foreign currencies with the most significant being the euro and singapore dollars 
the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates  as of june   amounts to  actual results may differ 
interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based upon its financing  investing and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company s financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this sensitivity analysis  the company used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be immaterial 
however  there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly affect its results of operations
