the extraordinary loss in fiscal represented the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized debt discount as a result of the repayment of long term debt in conjunction with our initial public offering in september we define comparable store sales as net sales from stores that have been open for more than full months and that have not been substantially remodeled during that time 
for purposes of determining the comparable store sales increase  average net sales per store and average net sales per gross square foot  fiscal results were recalculated based on a week year 
average net sales per store represents net sales from stores open throughout the full period divided by the number of such stores 
average square footage per store represents the square footage of stores open on the last day of the period divided by the number of such stores 
average net sales per gross square foot represents net sales from stores open throughout the full period divided by the gross square footage of such stores 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto included as item the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors 
overview the children s place retail stores  inc is a specialty retailer of apparel and accessories for children from newborn to twelve years of age 
as of march   we operated stores in states  located primarily in regional shopping malls 
we also sell our merchandise on our website 
over the last several years  we have been aggressively opening new stores to capitalize on our business strengths and strong store economics 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we opened a total of  and new stores  respectively 
we closed one store in fiscal and one store in fiscal we intend to continue our expansion program and currently plan to open approximately stores in fiscal  which will include approximately stores in canada 
our net sales have grown significantly during the past several years  primarily as a result of new store openings 
during fiscal  we reported a comparable store sales decline of due in part to the difficult economic climate which caused a slowdown in store traffic 
we reported comparable store sales growth of and during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
despite the weak sales environment  net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we were able to achieve improved profitability in fiscal through higher margins on our merchandise  a focus on our inventory levels and expense control 
earnings per share also increased to per share in fiscal from in fiscal during fiscal  we plan to focus our efforts on the opening of approximately stores  the start up of our canadian operations and distribution facility  and the implementation of certain information system initiatives  as well as an ongoing assessment of our administrative infrastructure to support our growing business 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at our retail stores or when shipped from our distribution center if the product was purchased from our website 
actual return rates have historically been within our expectations and the reserve established 
however  in the unlikely event that the actual rate of sales returns by customers increased significantly  our operational results could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market  using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
at any one time  inventories include items that have been marked down to our best estimate of their fair market value 
we base our decision to mark down merchandise based upon its current rate of sale  the season  age and sell through of the item 
to the extent that our estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce our gross margins and operating results 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion taste of our customers and provide a well balanced merchandise assortment that satisfies customer demand 
any inability to provide the proper quantity of appropriate merchandise in a timely manner could increase future markdown rates 
litigation we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business 
in our opinion  any ultimate liability arising out of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business

in addition  as we continue our store expansion program we will consider additional sources of financing to fund our long term growth 
our ability to meet our capital requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations and successfully implement our store expansion plans

our first quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the period leading up to the easter holiday 
our third quarter results are heavily dependent upon back to school sales and our fourth quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the holiday season
