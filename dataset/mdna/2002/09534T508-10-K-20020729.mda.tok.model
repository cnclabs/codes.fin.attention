as of april   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our net loss available to common stockholders for the years ended april   and was million  million and million  respectively 
these losses resulted from charges related to the impairment of certain intangible and long lived assets  the amortization of deferred stock 
table of contents compensation and goodwill  and significant costs incurred in the development and sale of our products and services 
additionally  we experienced a significant decline in the demand for our products during the year ended april  we believe this decline in revenue substantially resulted from the weakening global economy and a corresponding reduction in information technology spending 
unless there are positive changes in current macroeconomic conditions  we expect that the lowered levels of demand experienced in fiscal will continue throughout fiscal as a result  we expect to incur additional operating losses and continued negative cash flows from operations through at least fiscal our limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate  on an ongoing basis  our estimates and judgements  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  excess inventory and purchase commitments  investments  intangible assets  lease losses and restructuring accruals  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the accounting policies described below  among others  are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgements  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations revenue recognition and allowances  inventory write down  restructuring accruals  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition and allowances 
we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment  assuming that evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is determinable and collectibility is probable  unless the company has future obligations for installation or must obtain customer acceptance  in which case revenue is deferred until these obligations are met 
maintenance contract revenue is initially deferred when the customer purchases a maintenance contract and recognized evenly over the life of the contract 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our review process  revenue is recognized upon cash receipt 
during the course of fiscal  revenue from several of our customers was recognized upon cash receipt 
we also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer solvency  current economic and geographic trends  and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents inventory write down 
we write down inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments  and our reported results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs and other charges against earnings may be required 
restructuring accruals 
in fiscal  as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in information technology spending rates  we implemented two restructuring plans  which included reductions in workforce and a consolidation of facilities 
we performed a comprehensive analysis of our real estate facility requirements and identified excess facility space  which has subsequently been offered for sublease 
based upon the results of the analysis  during fiscal  we recorded charges related to estimated facilities lease losses  net of expected sublease income 
in determining the net facilities charge  various assumptions were made  including the time period over which the facilities will be vacant  expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates 
the charges recorded were estimates in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and represented the low end of an estimated range that may be adjusted upon the occurrence of future triggering events 
triggering events may include  but are not limited to  changes in estimated time to sublease the facilities  sublease terms  sublease rates  and lease termination 
should operating lease rental rates decline or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facility  adjustments to the facilities lease losses liabilities may be necessary in future periods based upon the then current actual events and circumstances 
in fiscal  we also recorded charges for a reduction in workforce in response to a decline in customer demand and macroeconomic conditions 
see item  note restructuring charges of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the united states 
results of operations net sales 
net sales decreased to million for the fiscal year ended april  from million in fiscal  which was an increase from million in fiscal this decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to fewer unit sales and a purchasing trend towards our lower end systems  which have lower average sales prices than our higher end systems  partially offset by increased service and other product revenue 
the increase in fiscal revenue was due to higher sales volumes resulting from the introduction of our   and series products and growth in our customer base as we expanded our sales force 
during fiscal  and  no customer accounted for more than of our net sales 
net sales from international operations were million  or of net sales  in fiscal  million  or of net sales  in fiscal  and million  or of net sales  in fiscal we expect international revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decrease moderately in fiscal compared to fiscal unless macroeconomic conditions improve sooner than anticipated  we believe near term demand for our products will remain soft in fiscal once conditions improve  we expect our net sales to increase as a result of continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  although the initial year over year growth rate in our net sales that we experienced in and is not expected to occur in the future 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was an increase from million in fiscal excluding a million inventory write down in the fourth quarter of fiscal and a million inventory write down in the fourth quarter of fiscal  gross margin decreased to in fiscal  and increased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  continued changes in the market demand caused an additional write down of inventory 
gross margin decreased in fiscal due to fixed manufacturing costs on lower volumes of sales 
these fixed manufacturing costs were reduced with the february restructuring plan 
the impact of the restructuring  however  is not expected to impact gross margins until the first quarter of fiscal during the second half of fiscal  excess inventories were built up in anticipation of projected sales volumes that never materialized as a result of the sharp deterioration in macroeconomic conditions that caused customers to defer or delay capital expenditures on information technology 
as a result  we wrote down million of excess and obsolete inventories 
excluding this write off  increases in gross margin were principally due to the introduction of higher margin products in fiscal  the resulting economies of scale from higher unit production and cost savings achieved by outsourcing component manufacturing 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including competition  fluctuations in demand for our products  the timing and size of customer orders and product implementations  the mix of direct and indirect sales  the mix and average selling prices of products  new product introductions and enhancements  component costs  manufacturing costs and product configuration 
if actual orders do not match our forecasts  as we have experienced in the past  we may have excess or inadequate inventory of some materials and components or we could incur cancellation charges or penalties  which would increase our costs or prevent or delay product shipments and could seriously harm our business 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  and prototype and testing equipment costs 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal these increases in research and development expenses in absolute dollars were primarily attributable to increases in staffing and associated support for engineers required to expand and enhance our product line and  to a lesser extent  expenses related to prototype and testing costs 
research and development headcount decreased to at april  from at april   which was an increase from at april  the decrease in research and development headcount resulted from the restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is expected to result in significantly lower research and development expenses beginning in the first quarter of fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  which was a decrease from in fiscal this increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales results from both the significant decrease in sales during fiscal  and the significant increase in expenses 
we continued to invest significantly in research and development projects during much of fiscal  while revenues were declining 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we significantly reduced research and development headcount in light of the continued lower revenue levels 
through april   all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
we expect research and development expenses to decrease beginning with the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the restructuring plan implemented in february should growth in demand for our products resume  and after we realize potential efficiencies within our research and development organization  we expect to increase our research and development expenses in absolute dollars and to increase headcount to provide for development of new products 
however  should sales decline further in future periods  we may implement additional cost cutting programs to further reduce our research and development expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  advertising and promotional expenses  and customer service and support costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was an 
table of contents increase from million in fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in is related to the reduction of headcount 
sales and marketing headcount decreased to at april  from at april   which was an increase from in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  and from in fiscal these decreases in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales occurred even with the lower revenue experienced in fiscal  reflecting our efforts to lower such expenditures to keep more in line with the reduced revenue that we are experiencing 
should growth in demand for our products resume  and after we realize potential efficiencies within our sales and marketing organization  we expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in an effort to expand domestic and international markets  introduce new products and establish and expand new distribution channels 
however  should sales decline further in future periods  we may implement additional cost cutting programs to further reduce our sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was an increase from million in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for fiscal is primarily attributable to decreased staffing and associated expenses 
general and administrative headcount decreased to at april  from at april   which was an increase from at april  as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from for in fiscal  which was a decrease from in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from the decline in sales experienced in fiscal compared to fiscal and the increase in the provision for bad debt expense in the second quarter of our fiscal we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease beginning with the first quarter of our fiscal as a result of the restructuring plan implemented in february should growth in demand for our products resume  and after we have realized potential efficiencies within our current general and administrative organization  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and to increase headcount to manage expanding operations and facilities 
however  should sales decline further in future periods  we may implement additional cost cutting programs to further reduce our general and administrative expenses 
stock compensation 
stock compensation expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was an increase from million in fiscal this non cash charge reflects the amortization of deferred stock compensation and termination and acceleration charges for departing employees 
stock compensation expense decreased significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal and as a result of the decreasing amount of amortization of stock compensation  most of which was recorded in connection with our november initial public offering  certain below market option grants in fiscal and unvested options assumed in our december acquisition of entera 
in addition  the fiscal expense includes a non recurring deferred stock compensation charge of million in connection with the accelerated vesting of certain unvested stock options held by our former chairman 
based on the options granted through april   we have a remaining balance of million in deferred stock compensation  approximately million of which we expect will be amortized in fiscal goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was an increase from no charges in fiscal this decrease in was primarily attributable to the cumulative million impairment of assets written off in the quarters ended april   july   october   january  and april  that ultimately decreased our entire goodwill balance to zero 
furthermore  the purchase price accounting for the acquisition of entera was completed during the quarter ended january   resulting in a reduction of million to goodwill 
for additional discussion regarding impaired goodwill  refer to the impairment of assets section below 
acquired in process technology 
we recorded a non recurring  non cash million charge in fiscal for the value of in process technology acquired in the entera transaction  which relates to in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future use in our development activities 
no such charges were recorded in fiscal years or 
table of contents there were two projects included in the in process technology for entera 
the efforts required to complete the acquired in process technology included the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design requirements  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the value of the acquired in process technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis rate of on the anticipated income stream of the related product revenues 
the discounted cash flow analysis was based on our forecast of future revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses related to the products and technologies purchased from entera 
the calculation of value was then adjusted to reflect only the value creation efforts of entera prior to the close of the acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  the products were approximately and complete  respectively  with approximately million and million in estimated costs remaining  respectively 
the majority of these costs were incurred by the end of fiscal the acquired in process technology was expensed in the period the transaction was consummated 
restructuring 
as discussed further in the reorganization plans section below and in item  note restructuring charges below  we recorded a non recurring million charge related to facilities closure costs  lease abandonment costs  certain employee severance costs and contract termination costs for fiscal impairment of assets 
as discussed further in the asset impairment section below  during each quarter of fiscal we performed an impairment assessment of our tangible and intangible assets and determined that enterprise level goodwill associated with the springbank and entera acquisitions was impaired 
as a result  a million impairment charge was recorded to write our enterprise level goodwill net book value down to zero in fiscal in addition  a million impairment charge was recorded in fiscal interest income and other expense 
net interest income and other expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was an increase from million in fiscal in general  the decreases in interest income and other expenses are due to the lower interest rates and cash available for investment 
the net interest income and other expenses of million recorded for fiscal include million  which reflects an other than temporary decline in value of our available for sale securities 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was an increase from million in fiscal  and is composed entirely of foreign corporate income taxes 
the foreign corporate income taxes are a function of our international expansion and the establishment of branches and subsidiaries in various jurisdictions 
the provision for income taxes is based on income taxes on minimum profits the foreign operations generated for services provided to us 
our tax expense for fiscal will continue to be significantly dependent on the amount and mix of income derived from sources subject to corporate income taxes of foreign taxing jurisdictions 
accretion of preferred stock 
in fiscal  a non recurring million charge was recorded in connection with the november issuance of  shares of series d preferred stock at per share to accrete the stock to its fair value 
during november  all of the shares of series d preferred stock converted to common stock upon completion of our initial public offering 
acquisitions springbank networks  inc on june   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of springbank networks  inc springbank  a privately held company organized to develop content management technologies 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date 
since june   the results of operations of springbank have been included in our consolidated statements of operations 
purchase consideration totaled approximately million and included approximately million shares of cacheflow common stock  approximately million of assumed liabilities and approximately million in transaction costs 
the entire million purchase price was allocated to goodwill 
for further discussion regarding goodwill  refer to the asset impairment section below 

table of contents entera  inc on december   we completed the acquisition of entera  inc entera  a company that develops standards based streaming content distribution and management technologies  in a stock for stock merger transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase consideration was approximately million consisting of approximately million shares of cacheflow common stock with a fair value of approximately million  the assumption of approximately  outstanding stock options with a fair value of approximately million  and approximately million in transaction costs 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was valued at million 
of this excess  million was allocated to goodwill  million was allocated to deferred compensation  and million was allocated to in process research and development 
for further discussion regarding goodwill  refer to the asset impairment section below 
stock compensation we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended april  and we did not record any deferred stock compensation in fiscal deferred stock compensation results from a variety of stock based transactions 
our stock compensation balance generally represents the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of stock options and warrants granted to employees  consultants  directors and third parties on the date such stock awards were granted 
however  we have also completed other stock based transactions that impact deferred stock compensation such as acquisitions in which the outstanding options of the acquired entity are assumed or instances where certain modifications are made to the terms and conditions of option grants subsequent to the grant date 
related stock compensation expense is recorded over the option vesting period  generally two to four years  or immediately if there is no vesting period 
we recorded stock compensation expense of approximately million  million and million for the years ended april   and we may record additional compensation in the future if management decides to grant below market stock options  assume outstanding options in any future acquisitions  modify outstanding stock awards subsequent to their date of grant  or enter into other transactions that may require the recognition of additional compensation 
we expect compensation expense  which is primarily attributable to amortization of deferred compensation charges  to impact our reported results through april  reorganization plans fiscal as discussed in item  note restructuring charges of the consolidated financial statements  in february  our board of directors approved a restructuring program to significantly reduce our operating expenses and to further align our organization with current market conditions  future revenue expectations and our planned future product direction 
this plan involved the following steps reducing our workforce by employees  which represented approximately of our workforce  closing and relocating two research and development facilities to the sunnyvale  california headquarters location  downsizing our international operations and discontinuing plans to fund additional international expansion we will continue to manage current international investments  and canceling certain vendor contracts that existed prior to the restructuring and enhancing productivity in our operations in an effort to reduce costs 
in connection with this restructuring plan  we accrued approximately million in the quarter ended april  relating to employee severance costs  facilities closure costs  lease abandonment costs and contract termination costs 
all employees were notified of their termination prior to april  estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding sublease rates and the time required to locate sub lessees that were derived from market trend information provided by a commercial real estate broker 

table of contents these estimates will be reviewed on a periodic basis and to the extent that these assumptions materially change due to changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expense for the abandoned facility will be adjusted 
as of april   substantially all severance costs related to domestic employees had been paid and million remain accrued for lease abandonment costs  contract termination costs and certain international employee severance costs 
the lease abandonment costs will be paid over the respective terms through in august  our board of directors approved a restructuring program in response to the continued economic slowdown that negatively impacted in the first quarter of fiscal demand for our products  as potential customers deferred spending on internet and intranet infrastructure 
in order to streamline our cost structure and better position us for growth  we implemented a reduction in workforce of approximately positions 
we incurred million in restructuring costs in the quarter ended october  to complete this effort  which included employee severance costs of approximately million and certain contract termination costs of approximately million 
as of april   severance payments to domestic and international employees were substantially completed  and of the million restructuring charges  million had been paid  leaving a remaining accrual of million for contract termination fees on our balance sheet 
fiscal in february  our board of directors approved a restructuring program instituted in response to the economic slowdown that negatively impacted the demand for our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as potential customers deferred spending on their internet and intranet infrastructure 
as part of the restructuring program  we implemented a reduction in workforce by employees and incurred million in restructuring charges  which included employee severance costs of approximately million and certain contract termination costs of approximately million 
at april   million of million in restructuring charges remain accrued 
as of october   these severance and contract termination payments were completed 
we cannot assure that our most recent restructuring program will achieve all of the expense reductions and other benefits that we anticipate 
in addition  anticipated savings from the reduced headcount or facility consolidations have been  and may in the future be  mitigated by subsequent increases in headcount and subsequent facilities additions related to our operating requirements 
see item  note restructuring charges of the consolidated financial statements for further discussions 
asset impairment in fiscal  management performed on a quarterly basis an impairment assessment of long lived assets and determined that certain enterprise level goodwill recorded in connection with our springbank and entera acquisitions was not fully recoverable 
the assessment was performed primarily due to the significant decline in our stock price  the net book value of assets significantly exceeding our market capitalization  and the overall decline in industry growth rates 
the overall decline in industry growth rates indicates that this trend may continue for an indefinite period 
as a result  we recorded million in impairment charges in fiscal to fully write off goodwill based on the market value method 
the estimate of fair value was based upon our average market capitalization  which was calculated using our average closing stock price surrounding july   october   january  and april  additionally  we recorded a write down of million of certain leasehold improvements  computer software and hardware in fiscal the leasehold improvements write down related to two research and development facilities  which were closed in connection with our february restructuring plan 
liquidity and capital resources from inception  we financed our operations and the purchase of property and equipment through private sales of preferred stock  bank loans  equipment leases  and an initial public offering of our common stock 
at april   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  and million in working capital 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we used cash primarily to fund our net losses from operations 
we implemented a strategic restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of our fiscal with the goal of reducing our net cash used in operating activities beginning with the first quarter of our fiscal cash used in operating activities in the fiscal includes million of payments against accrued restructuring liabilities related to terminated and vacated real estate leases 
we expect to make payments of approximately million against our accrued restructuring liabilities over the next months 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  and net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of property  plant and equipment  and to a lesser extent  to purchases of short term securities 
net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to sales of investment securities and cash acquired in business acquisitions  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 
we expect that  in the future  any cash in excess of current requirements will continue to be invested in short term investment grade  interest bearing securities 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our capital expenditures consisted primarily of purchases of computer  equipment and software  furniture and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activities for fiscal were primarily attributable to the exercise of employee stock options 
in fiscal  we raised million from the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset by employee stock repurchases 
in fiscal  financing came from numerous sources during may  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds from the sale of series c preferred stock at per share 
during october  we raised approximately million through the cash exercise of options granted to a board member and consultant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
during november  we raised approximately million through the sale of  shares of series d preferred stock at per share 
during november  we raised approximately million  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and offering costs  through sale of  shares of our common stock in an initial public offering at per share 
during december  million of the initial public offering proceeds were used to repay all of our outstanding debt 
we have no material commitments or obligations other than those under leases 
we do have minimal royalty and purchasing payment commitments in the ordinary course of our business 
as of april   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities  nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we have suffered recurring losses from operations and currently project such losses for fiscal our current business plan for reflects continued initiatives to increase revenue  reduce overhead  and realize the 
table of contents benefit of recent reductions in employee headcount and occupancy costs 
the plan projects that the amount of the quarterly net loss will decline from quarter to quarter with net income projected to begin in fiscal as a result  current cash and short term investment balances are projected to be sufficient to fund the excess of expenses over revenue for the year 
in our review of our operating requirements  we determined that even with a reduction of revenue in excess of from fiscal  we would still have sufficient working capital to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least fiscal if revenues decrease below that level without further expense reduction or if cash is used for unanticipated uses  we may need additional capital sooner than expected 
although we cannot guarantee that planned results will be obtained in fiscal or that sufficient debt or equity capital will be available to us under acceptable terms  if at all  we believe that our planned revenue and expense assumptions can be realized 
however  if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us  we will eventually be unable to continue our operations 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations statement  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
statement eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  statement further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the requirements of statement are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after june  under statement  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the amortization provisions of statement apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   companies are required to adopt statement in their fiscal year beginning after december  ie  may  for our fiscal year 
the provisions of each statement  which apply to goodwill and certain intangibles acquired prior to june  will be adopted by us on may  we believe the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for companies with fiscal year end beginning after december  ie  may  for our fiscal year 
statement supersedes fasb statement no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of a segment of a business of accounting principles board opinion no 
we believe the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to certain market risks including changes in exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposures to exchange and interest rate risks and we are not a party to any risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
as of april   we had approximately million invested primarily in certificates of deposit  and fixed rate  short term corporate and us government debt securities  which are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease 
table of contents in value if market us interest rates increase 
we maintain a strict investment policy  which is intended to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the following table presents notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of april  total fair value in thousands cash equivalents fixed rate average rate investments fixed rate average rate total investment securities average rate foreign currency exchange rate risk we develop products in the united states and sell them throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since all of our sales are currently made in united states dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
if any of the events described above were to occur  our net sales could be seriously impacted  since a significant portion of our net sales are derived from international operations 
for the fiscal years  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales were derived from customers outside of north america 
in contrast  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
specifically  the exposure includes intercompany loans  and third party sales or payments 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we  however  do not consider the market risk associated with our international operations to be material 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes
