similarly  statements that describe our objectives  plans or goals also are forward looking statements 
all of these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the relevant forward looking statement 
the principal risk factors that could cause actual performance and future actions to differ materially from the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  dependence on attracting and retaining qualified and experienced consultants  portability of client relationships  local political or economic developments in or affecting countries where we have operations  ability to manage growth  restrictions imposed by off limits agreements  competition  risks related to the growth and results of futurestep  reliance on information processing systems  and employment liability risk 
readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements included in this annual report are made only as of the date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to publicly update these forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are the world s leading recruitment firm with the broadest global presence in the recruitment industry 
our services include executive recruitment  middle management recruitment through futurestep  strategic management assessment and executive coaching 
we have approximately executive recruitment consultants and futurestep consultants based in nearly offices across countries 
our clients are many of the world s largest and most prestigious public and private companies  middle market and emerging growth companies as well as government and not for profit organizations 
over half of the executive recruitment searches we performed in fiscal were for board level  chief executive and other senior executive positions and our  clients included approximately of the fortune companies 
we have established strong client loyalty  
table of contents more than of the executive recruitment assignments we performed in fiscal were on behalf of clients for whom we had conducted multiple assignments over the last three fiscal years 
based on deteriorating economic conditions in late fiscal  we began developing a series of restructuring initiatives in the quarter ended july   to address our cost structure and to reposition the enterprise to gain market share and take full advantage of the eventual economic recovery 
our immediate goals were to reduce losses  preserve our top producers and maintain our high standards of client service 
in august  we announced these business realignment initiatives designed to reduce expenses in response to the current economic environment and to reposition our company to take advantage of the increase in the demand for recruitment services when the economy improves 
these initiatives resulted in a total charge against earnings in the first six months of fiscal of approximately million 
the charge reflects costs associated with a decision to reduce the workforce by approximately  or over employees  consolidate all back office functions for futurestep and korn ferry  exit the college recruitment market and write down related assets and goodwill 
in april  we implemented additional business realignment initiatives to further downsize our operations in europe  resulting in severance and facilities related charges for futurestep and executive recruitment of million 
in addition  we recognized a one time non cash charge of million to write off a non strategic investment that we believe is permanently impaired 
in june  we announced that we would account for our ownership interests in our mexico subsidiaries  which have been part of korn ferry since  under the equity method and restate our prior years results 
previously  we had consolidated the mexico subsidiaries operating results with a deduction for the other shareholders interest after tax 
while we believe that the consolidation method reflects the way these subsidiaries are managed and operate  the equity method best reflects our less than voting interest in the common stock of these entities 
there is no impact on earnings  eps  shareholders equity or net cash flow as a result of this restatement  however  revenue and expenses will be reduced 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results are based on our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
management is required to establish policies and procedures to ensure that revenue is only recorded for valid engagements  that the revenue from each engagement is recorded over the period of performance and related costs are matched against this revenue 
we provide recruitment services on a retained basis 
since the search is not contingent upon placement of a candidate  our assumptions are mainly related to establishing the period over which the service is performed 
these assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition and profitability for the period reported 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect the period over which revenue is earned  revenue and profit could be over or understated 

table of contents deferred compensation 
deferred compensation requires assumptions regarding participant data and the discount rate that can significantly impact the liability on our balance sheet and the related cost in our statement of operations 
management engages an actuary to review these assumptions to ensure that they reflect the population and economics of our deferred compensation plans in all material respects 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results due to changing market conditions  or changes in the participant population 
these differences could have a significant impact on our costs and liability 
carrying values 
valuations are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to determine the carrying value of various assets 
our most significant assets that require management to prepare or obtain valuations are goodwill and deferred income taxes 
management must identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and net earnings 
results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations with mexico on an equity basis for each of the past three fiscal years as a percentage of revenue fiscal year ended april  revenue compensation and benefits general and administrative expenses asset impairment and restructuring charges operating profit loss net income loss restated with mexico reported on the equity method

the continued weakness in the global economy has resulted in decreases in revenue in all of our business lines and geographic regions in fiscal this decline follows a year period of double digit growth 
executive recruitment revenue and operating profit loss  excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges  declined in all geographic regions in fiscal compared to each of the last two fiscal years 
the decline is due primarily to the slowdown of the united states economy that contributed to a decline of million or in executive recruitment revenue in north america for fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in futurestep revenue of for the fiscal year ended compared to fiscal reflects a decline in all geographic regions that is attributed to the weakness in the global economy 
futurestep operations in north america experienced the largest decline compared to the prior year primarily due to a decline in the number of engagements

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of

the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of its global operating activities  we are exposed to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships 
we manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below 
we have not utilized financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we trade in derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk generally  financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each year and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the year 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of comprehensive income 
financial results of foreign subsidiaries in countries with highly inflationary economies are measured in us dollars 
the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated using a combination of current and historical rates of exchange and any translation adjustments are included in determining net income 
historically  we have not realized any significant translation gains or losses on transactions involving us dollars and other currencies 
this is primarily due to natural hedges of revenue and expenses in the functional currencies of the countries in which our offices are located and investment of excess cash balances in us dollar denominated accounts 
in fiscal  and  we recognized foreign currency gains losses  after income taxes  of million  million and million  respectively  primarily related to our europe operations 
realization of translation gains or losses due to the translation of intercompany payables denominated in us dollars is mitigated through the timing of repayment of these intercompany borrowings 
interest rate risk we primarily manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our regular financing activities that generally are short term and provide for variable market rates 
as of april   we had an outstanding balance of million on our revolving line of credit bearing interest at prime plus  million of borrowings against the cash surrender value of coli contracts bearing interest primarily at variable rates payable at least annually and million of notes payable  of which million is due to shareholders resulting from business acquisitions in fiscal and  at rates ranging from to  of which million matures in fiscal and million matures in fiscal currently  we have all of our investments in interest bearing money market accounts at market rates
