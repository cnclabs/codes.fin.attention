item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page for a chart of hotel operating data for and application of business strategies internal growth from strong asset management  renovation  development and repositioning strong asset management we believe that the revenue and cash flow from our hotels will be maximized by intensive management and marketing 
we intend to derive increased cash flow through the application of our operating strategies  which include active hotel revenue maximization through effective yield management and cost containment initiatives 
we believe that our operators commitment to customer service and the experience of their management teams positions us to capitalize on the demand in our markets 
we also believe that  based on improving market conditions  the location of our core hotels  and the strength of our own and our operators management teams  the portfolio should provide us with the opportunity for long term cash flow growth through the hotel operations 
capital expenditure and renovation strategy we believe that our regular program of capital improvements at our hotels  including replacement and refurbishment of furniture  fixtures  and equipment  helps maintain and enhance their competitiveness and maximizes the results of the hotels operations 
consistent with this strategy  we have made significant renovations at several of our hotels in recent years 
in   and we spent million  million and million  respectively on renovations  excluding the projects at our chicago  illinois and lyndhurst  new jersey hotels which are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures 
this represented  and of   and consolidated hotel revenues  respectively  significantly above the hotel industry standard of 
looking forward to  we plan to continue certain capital improvement project at the hotels  however  the terms of the march amendment to our credit facility contain restrictive provisions relative to capital expenditure activity 
specifically  we are entitled to complete our renovations and expansion projects at our chicago  meadowlands and pink shell properties as discussed within the liquidity and capital resources section 
table of contents of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our other capital expenditures are limited to of our total hotel revenues 
development  expansion and repositioning strategy within the past year we have reflagged repositioned two hotels  the southfield embassy suites in october and the meadowlands lyndhurst courtyard by marriott in february in  we commenced an approximate million renovation of the executive plaza hotel in chicago  illinois 
upon completion  expected to be in the third quarter of  the property will be repositioned as a four star quality independent hotel and renamed hotel  which reflects the address of the property 
we have a ownership interest in this property through a joint venture formed with aew partners iii  lp aew  an investment partnership managed by aew capital management  lp  a boston based real estate investment firm that manages a portfolio of approximately billion 
in november  we completed a million renovation of a unit tower at the pink shell beach resort in ft 
myers beach  florida 
these renovated studio units in the tower are being sold as sanibel view villas condominiums  with the expectation that the unit owners will make their units available to us by contract for rental as hotel rooms 
as of march   of these units have sold  netting proceeds in excess of the renovation cost of the entire project 
we also continue to work on an expansion project at the pink shell beach resort  which would increase the resort by rooms 
although we are not obligated at this point to proceed with the project  our plan would be to demolish cottage units  or about of the rooms at the resort 
we would then construct a unit tower called white sand villas that would significantly upgrade the character of the resort 
the units in the new tower would be sold as condominiums  with the expectation that the owners would put their unused room nights back to the resort by contract 
as with any renovation  the shorter term effects may be a lower revenues due to the demolition of the cottage units 
the pre marketing activity for the project has generated significant interest 
we anticipate that we will only proceed with this project when we have sufficient pre sales of these units to fund construction costs and we have secured financing 
we anticipate that we may be in a position to commence construction in the summer of we may seek to develop additional full service or upscale limited service hotels on land that we acquire in our current geographic markets or on land contiguous to our hotels 
we believe that selective development of hotels in our existing geographic markets could enable us to take advantage of operating efficiencies to generate attractive returns on our investment 
we may also expand our existing hotels and or reposition under performing hotels by changing the franchise brand affiliation 
portfolio management we believe that the upscale and mid price market segments of the hospitality industry will present attractive acquisition opportunities 
our acquisition strategy focuses on the following categories target markets and product type full service commercial and resort hotels located in major urban markets  business centers and destination beach markets 
market repositioning opportunities undervalued hotels whose occupancy  daily rates and overall revenues can be significantly enhanced through new brand affiliations and or implementation of new management and marketing strategies which will maximize revenues and profitability 
redevelopment and renovation opportunities hotels with sound operational fundamentals that  because of a lack of capital  require physical renovation to achieve their full performance potential  and other properties which can benefit from total redevelopment and market repositioning 
portfolio acquisitions portfolios of hotels which result in geographic economies of scale or which may be managed by proven hotel operators  and that may benefit from our repositioning and redevelopment experience and access to capital 

table of contents we intend to maintain a geographically diversified hotel portfolio and may also cluster hotels within certain primary markets in order to take advantage of operational and managerial economies of scale 
we will acquire or develop additional hotel properties only as suitable opportunities arise  and will not undertake acquisition or development of properties unless adequate sources of capital and financing are available 
we will also sell selected non core suburban assets 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from capital obtained from borrowings  from the proceeds of the sale of non strategic hotels  from additional issuances of common shares  preferred shares  or other securities  from potential joint venture partners and from cash flows from operations 
our credit facility currently places limitations on our ability to make acquisitions 
brand strategy we believe that we can maximize our market share and revenue by taking advantage of our orientation toward sales and marketing to identify the most effective branding and to leverage our brands with effective direct sales strategies 
we focus on owning hotel properties that are  or can be  associated with brands that will lead the hospitality industry in revpar 
our portfolio is currently operated under franchise license agreements with premier nationally recognized hotel chains  including marriott  radisson  hilton  embassy suites  doubletree  holiday inn  hampton inn and quality suites 
we expect to continue to affiliate with a number of different franchisors in order to maximize the performance of our hotels by providing greater access to a broad base of national marketing and reservation systems  and to mitigate the risks of franchise loss and franchise overlap 
we believe that our relationships with certain franchisors facilitate finding acquisition opportunities and completing acquisitions on attractive terms 
in selected markets  hotels can be most appropriately marketed and positioned without the need of a franchise affiliation 
our french lick springs resort and spa in french lick  indiana operates as an independent hotel 
upon completion of the renovation of our chicago property in the third quarter of  hotel will also operate independent of a franchise agreement 
broad based reservation systems are available and are being used by the independent hotels 
our hotels franchise agreements expire at various dates through february   which  in some cases  may be extended for additional terms 
the franchise agreements generally impose certain management  operational  record keeping  accounting  reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which the franchised operator must comply 
some of the key provisions of the franchise agreements include the following the franchise agreements provide for early termination at the franchisor s option on the occurrence of certain events of default  such as the failure to properly maintain the hotel 
notification must be given to the franchisor upon the sale of a hotel giving the franchisor rights  as defined in its franchise agreement  ranging from consent to the transfer of ownership  the franchisor s ability to match an offer for sale  or the right to terminate the franchise agreement 
several of the franchise agreements can be terminated upon sale by the franchisee 
operator strategy in selecting operators  we seek hotel managers with demonstrated full service hotel expertise  a stable operating and financial performance history  an excellent reputation in the hospitality industry  an ability to introduce additional acquisition opportunities to us and to manage additional hotels for us

we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating  financing and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures and fund other cash needs 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the nareit definition differently than us 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions

table of contents significant accounting policies the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
through december   our principal source of revenue was lease payments from lessees pursuant to percentage lease agreements 
percentage lease revenue is based upon the room  food and beverage and other revenues of our hotels 
we recognize lease revenue for interim and annual reporting purposes on an accrual basis pursuant to the terms of the respective percentage leases and on an interim basis in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
under the provisions of sab no 
 a portion of our percentage lease revenues  which historically were recognized in the first  second  and third quarters  are deferred and recognized in the fourth quarter 
sab no 
impacts the interim reporting of revenues related to our leases  but has no impact on interim cash flow or year end results of operations 
in and beyond  sab no 
only impacts the consolidated statement of operations for the lease revenues related to the two hotels not operated under the trs structure as lease revenues from hotels operated under the trs will be eliminated in consolidation 
commencing in  as a result of the trs transaction  our principal source of revenue is the revenues generated from hotel operations 
the rooms  food and beverage and other revenue of the hotels are recognized as the services are provided 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform our review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceed its carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount to the related hotel property s estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
in the fourth quarter of and  we recorded charges of  and  respectively  for unrealized losses on the carrying value of several hotels due to their book value exceeding their net realizable value 
we do not believe that there are any factors or circumstances indicating impairment of any other of our investments in hotel properties at this time 
we estimate the fair market values of our properties through a combination of each property s expected cash flow generated from operations  holding period and ultimate proceeds from disposition 
in projecting the expected cash flows from operations of the asset  we base our estimates on future projected earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  and deduct expected capital expenditure requirements 
we then apply growth assumptions to project these amounts over the expected holding period of the asset 
our growth assumptions are based on estimated inflationary increases in room rates and expenses and the demand for lodging at our properties  as impacted by local and national economic conditions and estimated or known future new hotel supply 
the estimated proceeds from disposition are judgmentally determined based on a combination of anticipated cash flow in the year of disposition  cap rate  ratio of selling price to gross hotel revenues and selling price per room 
if actual conditions differ from those in our assumptions  the actual results of each asset s future operations and fair market value could be significantly different from the estimated results and value used in our analysis

the decrease in hotel revenues from the prior year  and resultant decrease in our lease revenues  resulted from the weak hotel operating environment 
during the first eight months of  lodging demand declined modestly due to the softening economy  following september th  the decline in demand was more severe 
another factor contributing to the decrease in revenues was the sale of the daytona beach radisson resort in january  which generated lease revenues of million in additionally  in february  we took over the radisson hotel mt

table of contents of in represented the write off of deferred financing costs associated with our former line of credit which was replaced in the third quarter of bmc results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended for the year ended december   bmc had hotel revenues of million compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the events of september th and the slowdown in travel in the subsequent months combined with the continued softening demand as a result of the slowing economy 
the sale of the daytona beach radisson resort in january also contributed to the decrease in hotel revenues  as million of revenues were recorded in versus 
million in percentage lease expense during was million  or of hotel revenues  compared to million  or of hotel revenues  in departmental and other hotel operating expenses  consisting primarily of rooms expenses  food and beverage costs  franchise fees  utilities  repairs and maintenance  and other general and administrative expenses of the hotels were million in compared to million in as a percent of hotel revenues  the departmental and other hotel operating expenses increased to in from in  because of falloff in demand during results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended for the year ended december   bmc had hotel revenues of million compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the addition of the executive plaza hotel in which a subsidiary of bmc commenced operations at the end of august percentage lease expense during was million  or of hotel revenues  compared to million  or of hotel revenues  in departmental and other hotel operating expenses  consisting primarily of rooms expenses  food and beverage costs  franchise fees  utilities  repairs and maintenance  and other general and administrative expenses of the hotels  were million in compared to million in as a percent of hotel revenues  the departmental and other hotel operating expenses decreased to in from in  because of increases in hotel revenues at a higher rate relative to increased expenses incurred 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary source of cash to meet our cash requirements  including distributions to shareholders  was our share of the partnership s cash flow from the percentage leases 
the lessees obligations under the percentage leases were largely unsecured and the lessees ability to make rent payments to the partnership under the percentage leases was substantially dependent upon the lessees ability to generate sufficient cash flow from the operation of the hotels 
going forward  under the trs structure  our primary source of cash will be our share of the partnership s cash flow from the operations of the hotels 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  and million of restricted cash for the payment of capital expenditures  real estate tax and insurance 
we had outstanding borrowings totaling million and million against our credit facility and term notes payable  respectively 
as of december   we had a million credit facility available  as limited under terms of the credit agreement  to fund acquisitions of additional hotels  renovations and capital expenditures  and for our working capital needs 
for information relating to the terms of our credit facility and our million  million  and million term notes payable  please see notes and  respectively  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of boykin lodging company included in this form k 
our million and million term notes payable are property specific mortgages and pose no covenant compliance issues 
the million drawn on the credit facility as of december  and the million term note contain covenant formulas regarding our overall leverage and debt service coverage 
as anticipated  at 
table of contents december   we were not in compliance with these covenants  but were granted a waiver for such non compliance by our banks 
in march  we amended both debt facilities in order to  among other things  ease these leverage and debt service coverage covenants 
we eliminated unused capacity on our credit facility that we were paying non use fees on by reducing the facility from million to million 
we also were able to obtain the option to automatically extend the maturity date on the million facility from its scheduled october maturity to july  the same time the credit facility matures 
we expect that our interest expense under these amended facilities will increase by approximately to million per quarter and that our quarterly amortization expense related to deferred financing costs will increase by approximately million per quarter 
the terms of the amendment to our credit facility contain more restrictive provisions than before relative to  among other things  our acquisition and capital expenditure activity  as well as the amount of distributions we may pay out 
specifically  we may only use up to million of proceeds under our credit facility for new acquisitions and  except for the ability to complete our renovations and expansion projects at our chicago  meadowlands and pink shell properties  our capital expenditures may not exceed of our total hotel revenues 
in addition  dividends on our common shares can not exceed the lesser of of our ffo or million per quarter  subject to certain exceptions  one being that we are entitled to distribute up to of reit taxable income 
the terms of the amendments also provide that these restrictions may cease once our financial covenant tests are back in line with the thresholds provided for in the original credit facility agreements 
based upon our current revpar and cash flow expectations  we expect to be in compliance with our covenants under the amended facilities throughout we can not guarantee that our actual results will not differ materially from our expectations 
we may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities  replacement credit facilities  or we may issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate  and be subject to such other terms as the board of directors considers prudent 
the availability of borrowings under the credit facility is restrained by borrowing base and loan to value limits  as well as other financial performance covenants contained in the agreement 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available in anticipated amounts from the credit facility 
the impact of the recent weak hotel operating environment and the events of september th on our cash flow and balance sheet has been dramatic 
we suspended the fourth quarter dividend and recently announced that the suspension would continue through the first quarter at this time  based on our current revpar and cash flow expectations  we anticipate that we will reinstate our dividend for the third quarter of  payable during the fourth quarter  but at a level significantly lower than historical levels 
we hope to be in a position to distribute approximately to of our annualized ffo per share going forward  or approximately per share for the third quarter payment based on the low end of our current ffo guidance 
our priorities are to conserve cash and maintain our leverage to allow us to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace 
in  we expect to spend approximately million in renovations at our hotels  excluding the pink shell and chicago executive plaza projects discussed below 
this amount primarily includes planned refurbishments and replacements at selected existing hotels 
we expect to use cash available from operations and restricted capital expenditure reserves  as well as borrowings under our line or credit to fund our renovations 
we also continue to work on an expansion project at the pink shell beach resort  which would increase the resort by rooms 
although we are not obligated at this point to proceed with the project  our plan would be to demolish cottage units  or about of the rooms at the resort 
we would then construct a unit tower called white sand villas that would significantly upgrade the character of the resort 
the units in the new tower would be sold as condominiums  with the expectation that the owners would put their unused room nights back to the resort by contract 
we anticipate that we will only proceed with the approximate million expansion project when we have enough pre sales of these units to fund our construction costs and we have secured financing 
our approximate million renovation of the chicago executive plaza hotel is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of during  the joint venture which owns the property spent approximately million 
table of contents towards the total renovation costs 
the remaining funding will be provided through equity contributions to the joint venture and draws on the construction loan previously secured 
we intend to provide million of equity funding in utilizing our credit facility 
we have an active shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to million in securities 
securities issued under this registration statement may be preferred shares  depository shares  common shares or any combination thereof  and may be issued at different times  depending on market conditions 
warrants to purchase these securities may also be issued 
the terms of issuance of any securities covered by this registration statement would be determined at the time of their offering 
inflation operators of hotels in general can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the operators ability to raise rates to keep pace with inflation 
our general and administrative costs as well as real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance and ground rent are subject to inflation 
seasonality our hotels operations historically have been seasonal 
twenty nine of our hotels maintain higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
the four hotels located in florida experience their highest occupancy in the first quarter 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in our quarterly cash flow received from hotel operations 
competition and other economic factors our hotels are located in developed areas that contain other hotel properties 
the future occupancy  adr and revpar of any hotel could be materially and adversely affected by an increase in the number of or quality of the competitive hotel properties in its market area 
competition could also affect the quality and quantity of future investment opportunities  or our ability to sell existing properties 
as a portion of the lodging industry s sales are based upon business  commercial and leisure travel  changes in general economic conditions  demographics  or changes in local business economics  could affect these and other travel segments 
this may affect demand for rooms  which would affect hotel revenues 
please refer to item c of this form k for further discussion regarding competition 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to carry all derivative instruments including embedded derivatives in the balance sheet at fair value 
during  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
also established a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the effect this new standard will have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations  if any 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments that bear interest at variable rates that fluctuate with market interest rates 
these debt instruments include our million secured credit facility  our million secured term loan  our million secured term loan and our share of floating rate debt under our unconsolidated joint ventures of million 
we have entered into both variable and fixed rate debt arrangements to allow us to optimize the balance of using variable rate debt versus fixed rate debt 
our variable rate debt allows us to maximize financial flexibility when selling properties and minimize potential prepayment penalties on fixed rate loans 
our million  fixed rate term note allows us to minimize our interest rate risk exposure 
in march  we also purchased interest protection on million of our floating rate debt that fixes the overall interest rate on this debt at 
approximately of our outstanding debt at december  is fixed rate in nature  compared with at the end of the weighted average interest rate of our variable rate debt was as of december  we review interest rate exposure continuously in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
it is our policy to manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates on our borrowings  through the use of fixed rate debt instruments  to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements  and after considering the need for financial flexibility related to our debt arrangements 
we may enter into forward interest rate agreements  or similar agreements  to hedge our variable rate debt instruments where we believe the risk of adverse changes in market rates is significant 
under a forward interest rate agreement  if the referenced interest rate increases  we would be entitled to a receipt in settlement of the agreement that economically would offset the higher financing cost of the debt issued 
if the referenced interest rate decreases  we would make payments in settlement of the agreement  creating an expense that economically would offset the reduced financing cost of the debt issued 
other than the interest protection agreement discussed above  we do not have any other material market sensitive financial instruments 
we do not believe that changes in market interest rates will have a material impact on the performance or fair value of our hotel portfolio as the value of our hotel portfolio is based primarily on the operating cash flow of the hotels  before interest expense charges 
however  a change of in the index rate to which our variable rate debt is tied would change our annual interest incurred by 
million  based upon the balances outstanding on our variable rate instruments at december
