item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included below in item and factors that may affect future results included above in item of this annual report on form k 
overview for the years ended december   and  we had net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for our product offerings  the rate of market acceptance of current and new products  the timing of the introduction by our strategic partners of commercial products based on our technology  the timing of regulatory approvals  our ability to scale up manufacturing operations and avoid component shortages  the introduction of new products by our competitors  the timing  extent and capital needs of our research and development efforts and the timing of significant orders 
our limited operating history makes accurate predictions of future operations difficult 
based upon preliminary first quarter revenue analysis  we believe the company s revenues will be significantly below the company s earlier guidance 
we attribute the anticipated revenue shortfall primarily to the fact that certain of our strategic partners continue to have delays in their commercialization timetables  thereby resulting in significantly reduced purchases of the company s instruments and consumable products 
our ability to achieve sustained profitability will depend upon our ability to continue to enter into strategic partnerships with companies that will develop and market products incorporating our technology and market and distribute our systems and consumables 
strategic partners will develop application specific bioassay kits for use on our systems that they will sell to their customers generating royalties for us 
strategic partners may also perform testing services for third parties using our technology that will also result in royalties for us 
some strategic partners will also buy our products and then resell those products to their customers 
through december   we have entered into strategic partnerships with companies 
of our strategic partners  only partners have released commercialized products utilizing the luminex platform 
revenue on sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  these criteria are met at the time our product is shipped 
we expect that each system s sale will generate a recurring revenue stream from the sale of consumable products 
in addition  we recognized royalty revenues for the first time from some of our strategic partners during royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells products incorporating our technology or provides testing services to third parties using our technology 
royalty revenue is recognized as it is reported to us by our partners and payment is typically submitted concurrently with the report and is reported as product revenue 
during  we also began selling to our customers extended service contracts for maintenance and support of our products 
in accordance with the terms of a federal grant from which the company withdrew on july   grant revenue was recorded as research expenses relating to the grant as incurred  provided that the amounts received were not refundable if the research was not successful 
two customers accounted for of product revenue in  and respectively 
we believe these customers relationships to be good  however  the loss of either customer  a significant reduction in product purchases or financial difficulty for either customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and resulting operations 
we believe these customers will continue as significant customers in  however  we do not currently expect such customers to maintain purchases at the same level as cost of product revenue consists of direct and indirect manufacturing  quality control  training  customer service and warranty costs 
our operating expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing scale up and business development and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we continue to develop the rbm business unit and other new products and services 
our rbm business unit  so long as it remains a business unit within the company  will be incurring research and development expenses  including expenses related to the acquisition of blood samples  development of the assays  development of the software that will capture the data and analyze the results and establishment of the laboratory 
our selling and marketing expenses will increase as we continue to commercialize our products  and general and administrative expenses will increase as we add personnel and expand our facilities 
deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of options or warrants and the fair market value of restricted stock grants 
for options granted to employees and directors  this difference is calculated as of the grant date and amortized ratably over the vesting period 
for options or warrants granted to consultants  the difference is recognized as of the vesting date with adjustments made to the recognized deferred compensation amount up and until that time based on the market value of our common stock 
as a result of stock options  warrants and restricted stock grants  we recorded  million and million in deferred stock compensation expense in the years ended december   and  respectively 
total unamortized deferred stock compensation as of december  was  total deferred revenue as of december  was  and consisted of i payments received for sales to customers with rights of return that had not yet expired  ii upfront payments from strategic partners to be used for the purchase of products or to be applied towards future royalty payments and iii unamortized revenue related to extended service contracts 
upfront payments from our strategic partners are nonrefundable and will be recognized as revenue as our strategic partners purchase products or apply such amounts against royalty payments

quarterly results the following table sets forth certain quarterly financial data for the periods indicated in thousands  except per share data 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenue     gross profit    loss from operations     net loss     basic loss per share quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenue     gross profit  loss from operations     net loss     basic loss per share liquidity and capital resources at december   we held cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and had working capital of million 
at december   we held cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance of equity securities 
our cash reserves are held directly or indirectly in a variety of short term  interest bearing instruments  including obligations of the united states government or agencies thereof and us corporate debt securities 
cash used in operations was million in  compared with million in cash used consisted of the million net loss for  increase in inventories of million at december  and an increase in receivables of million 
purchases of property and equipment in totaled million  compared with million in we have contractual minimum purchase commitments with one of our contract manufacturers 
should our production requirements fall below the level of our commitments we could be required to take delivery of inventory for which we have no immediate need or incur an increased cost per unit going forward 
the company is not otherwise committed to scheduled purchase requirements 
however  because of a long lead time to delivery  we are required to place orders for a variety of items well in advance of scheduled production runs 
should the company s need for raw materials and components used in production continue to fluctuate  we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing delivery of those materials 
our research and development expenses in were million  of which the rbm project was approximately million 
in we expect non rbm research and development expenses to remain comparable 
with respect to rbm  our research and development expenses could increase over prior year levels 
based on current plans  it is anticipated that aggregate research and development expenses for will be in the range of to million if rbm remains a business unit within the company 
as set forth in item business research and development  we are evaluating various legal  accounting and tax implications of structuring alternatives designed to provide rbm with capital 
if and until such a transaction occurs  the research and development expenses associated with rbm will continue to be incurred by the company 
anticipated research and development expenses for rbm for are expected to be in the range of to million 
selling  general and administrative expenses should increase slightly over as a result of additions to personnel  increased production and commercialization efforts and increased expenditures for product development and for the expenses related to development of our business unit 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products  payments under possible future strategic arrangements  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the need to acquire licenses to new technology and the status of competitive products 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are sufficient to fund our current operating expenses and capital equipment requirements for we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  incurring debt financing could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into agreements on unattractive terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments held to maturity 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
all payments for our products  including sales to foreign customers  are required to be made in us dollars  therefore  we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities 
accordingly  our foreign currency market risk is limited
