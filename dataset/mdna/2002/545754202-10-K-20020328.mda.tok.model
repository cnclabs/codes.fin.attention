one of our key strategies is to pursue selectively strategic acquisitions to enter new markets  expand our suite of services and product offering  increase our customer base and strengthen our market position 
in we completed one acquisition and we completed five acquisitions 
vidipax acquisition 
in june we acquired vidipax  a new york company which performs audio and video media restoration and migration services 
the acquisition price was million in cash   shares of common stock and an additional contingent payment in july of  shares 
discovermusic acquisition 
in march  we acquired discovermusic  a seattle company which was the largest provider of music samples on the internet 
the acquisition price was million in cash including acquisition costs and accrued liabilities  net of discovermusic s cash  and  shares of common stock 
online radio acquisitions 
in march and june  we acquired the assets and technology of two online radio companies  onair streaming networks and thedial 
the acquisition price was million in cash and  shares of common stock 
addition systems acquisition 
in june we acquired addition systems  inc  a los angeles company which develops proprietary content insertion technology 
the acquisition price was million in cash plus acquisition costs and  shares of common stock 
activate acquisition 
in september we acquired activate 
net corporation  a seattle company which provides live and on demand webcasting services for a variety of enhanced enterprise communication needs 
the acquisition price was million in cash  million of assumed liabilities and a deferred payment of million in stock or cash one year from the initial close of the transaction 
in we implemented operational consolidation and cost saving initiatives  which included the integration and realignment processes related to our acquisition activity 
as a result of these initiatives  we consolidated our production operations from three separate facilities to the one facility acquired in the activate transaction  and implemented a reduction in personnel 
details related to these initiatives are described in more detail below under special charges 
we believe that as a result of these actions in and additional operational and management realignment actions taken in march  gross margins and operating margins should improve 
we estimate that a significant majority of our cost of sales  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses are fixed or semi fixed 
sales commissions are variable depending upon orders booked and when revenue is recognized 
we have sustained losses on a quarterly and annual basis since inception and we expect to sustain losses for the foreseeable future as we invest in and grow our operations 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
operating losses resulted from significant costs incurred in the development and sale of our products and services as well as significant non cash charges related to stock based compensation and amortization of intangibles and other assets 
special charges related to property and equipment impairments  intangibles impairments and facilities shut downs have been a material component of operating losses as well 
we expect our operating expenses to decrease on an annual basis as we execute our business plan 
we anticipate that operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  debt repayments and any acquisitions  will constitute a material use of our cash resources in we expect to incur additional losses 
table of contents and continued negative cash flow from operations in we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability or positive operating cash flow 
our limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult 
in view of our limited operating history and the early and rapidly evolving nature of our business  we believe that interim and annual period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
our business prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties often encountered by early stage companies in the internet related products and services market 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and uncertainties 
we have experienced significant percentage growth in revenues in certain previous periods  however  we do not believe that prior growth rates or possibly even sequential quarterly growth are sustainable or indicative of future growth rates see forward looking statements 
in some future quarter our operating results may fall below our expectations as well as those of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock may fall significantly 
results of operations year ended december  compared to revenue 
revenues totaled million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to lower digital media services revenues offset by increases in media restoration revenues 
digital media services revenue decreased to million in from million in due to fewer large encoding projects in  and the decision in early to discontinue our digital media consulting services 
this decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of music samples revenues from the acquisition of discovermusic in march and enterprise webcasting revenues from the acquisition of activate in september music samples revenues totaled million in we had no such services available in  and accordingly had no such revenues 
we believe that revenues derived from our music samples service will not fluctuate significantly in enterprise webcasting services contributed million in revenues since our acquisition of activate on september  we believe the demand for such services will grow significantly in  contributing to higher revenues on a consolidated basis and we expect that webcasting revenues will comprise a significant percentage of our consolidated revenues in in we generated revenues from consulting services and the sale or license of custom applications and other totaling million 
these revenues related to product and service offerings that we decided to no longer support after our operational restructurings 
in we generated approximately  from such offerings before their discontinuation 
media restoration revenues totaled million in  as compared to  in this increase was the result of the inclusion of a full year of results in as compared to six months in  and increased orders from customers  notably coca cola  which provided approximately of consolidated revenues in we expect revenues generated from vidipax to increase in additionally  we believe that as a percentage of consolidated revenues  vidipax will continue to be significant  although we expect that percentage to decline 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to million in from million in on a consolidated basis 
costs  excluding depreciation and amortization  to generate the revenues described above decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the significantly lower number of personnel involved in digital media services production 
this reduction in headcount came as a result of the completion of our digital media archive system  which has allowed us to fulfill digital music encoding orders in a more automated manner rather than the historical method requiring significant manual processing 
the non cash component of cost of revenues  which is primarily depreciation  increased to million from million in as a result of a full year s depreciation in of our production facility 
adding to this increase was higher levels of equipment purchases throughout  contributing only a partial year of depreciation in  but a full year in cost of revenues increased from primarily due to decreased revenues and capacity utilization  as well as increased depreciation 
table of contents expense in from significant asset acquisitions in these increases were partially offset by the inclusion of higher margin product offerings acquired from discovermusic and vidipax 
we believe that margins should improve as a result of the consolidation of our production operations from three separate facilities to the one facility acquired in the activate transaction and the related reduction in personnel 
this integration should result in lower overhead costs in one shared facility 
we expect margins on traditional service offerings to improve as product mix changes towards enterprise webcasting  subscription services and offerings based upon our archival platform 
media restoration cost of sales totaled million in  an increase from  in the increase in gross margin was a result of increased levels of capacity utilization of its production lab as well as greater levels of orders on a relatively fixed cost of production 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the increase over the same period in is primarily due to the acquisition of online radio technology and personnel in  increased headcount in the first quarter of over the same period in the prior year and the cessation of capitalization of software development costs on projects completed in additionally  research and development headcount increased as a result of the acquisition of activate in september costs of enhancing the automated production system  the development of our archival platform and the continued development of online radio technology and other unannounced applications and service offerings comprised a majority of our research and development expenses in  while included a number of projects which have since been terminated 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
however  due to our operational restructuring and focus on digital audio opportunities and enterprise webcasting services  development headcount was significantly reduced and  as a result  we expect research and development expenses to decline in we had no media restoration services costs classified as research and development  and accordingly this had no impact on the consolidated results 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  co marketing expenses  trade show expenses  product branding costs  advertising and cost of marketing collateral 
the significant decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to the decreased personnel subsequent to our corporate restructuring and an overall reduction in marketing spending 
media restoration services sales and marketing expenses totaled  and  in and  respectively 
this increase was due to a full year of results in as compared to six months in and a general increase in commissions and other selling expenses to generate the increased level of sales 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the higher average headcount in compared to  an increase in unallocated facilities charges in  contractual bonuses paid to employees acquired in the vidipax transaction and increased legal expenses related to ongoing corporate initiatives 
general and administrative expenses also increased as a result of the acquisition of activate 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will decrease in future periods as a result of our restructuring 
fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses included a reduction of  in our bonus accrual resulting from a board of directors decision in late to conserve our cash resources and not pay cash bonuses to executives and certain other employees 
this reduction in our bonus accrual was partially offset by a one time charge of approximately  related to the write off of a significant receivable from a company that declared bankruptcy in december there were no revenues recognized in from that company 
media restoration general and administrative expenses totaled million and  in and  respectively 
this increase was due to a full year of results in as compared to six months in there were no appreciable differences in administrative expenses at vidipax from year to year  and accordingly  the monthly expense rate was relatively flat between years 

table of contents amortization of intangibles and other assets 
amortization of intangibles and other assets totaled million and million in and  respectively  and includes amortization of the goodwill and identified intangible assets related to past acquisitions and amortization related to the fair value of warrants granted to certain partners 
the increase was primarily due to increased amortization resulting from the discovermusic  onair  addition systems  inc and thedial transactions completed in and amortization of intangibles resulting from the vidipax acquisition in june  partially offset by lower amortization on intangibles resulting from the alive 
com transaction in  which were written down to estimated fair market value in the special charge 
future amortization will decrease significantly as a result of the impairment charges recorded in this impairment charge is described more fully in the section entitled special charges below 
this reduction in future amortization is expected to be slightly offset by amortization of the intangibles generated by the activate acquisition 
there was no amortization of intangibles and other assets from media restoration in or stock based compensation 
stock based compensation totaled  and million in and  respectively 
stock based compensation in was insignificant 
stock based compensation in consisted of million in amortization of deferred stock compensation  related to stock options previously granted below deemed fair market value  million in compensation expense related to the variable accounting treatment and the subsequent termination in the third quarter of of our consultant options  a charge of  related to the acceleration of options and  in credits related to the reversal of previously amortized deferred stock compensation due to option cancellations 
in the fourth quarter of  we accelerated the vesting of approximately  options that resulted in a charge of approximately  to stock based compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation will continue to decrease as the remaining amortization period expires 
as of december   approximately  remains in unamortized deferred stock compensation  of which approximately  is expected to be amortized in there was no stock based compensation recorded at vidipax in or in july  we exchanged  employee options with an exercise price greater than for  new options with an exercise price of 
these new options are accounted for as variable options  however since the exchange  our stock price has declined in value  and no stock based compensation charges have been generated 
should our stock price increase above the new options exercise prices  there could be substantial non cash charges recorded 
special charges 
in  we undertook a series of operational restructurings and facilities consolidations 
we assessed each product and service offering and the costs related to each in making the determination to cease providing  or otherwise change the level of support we provide for these offerings 
we determined that it was not feasible to continue to provide or support digital media consulting services  certain digital media applications and the alive e show platform in additionally  the decision was made to decrease the level of emphasis placed on video encoding activities 
this decision was made as a response to the decreased demand for such services  which started in the third quarter of and continued into the first quarter of  at which time we determined that no further resources would be provided to support video encoding in our seattle facility 
in the second quarter of we terminated approximately of our workforce 
that reduction in force created excess facilities  resulting in the development of facilities consolidation plans 
these plans of consolidation generated additional special charges for rent accruals as well as tenant improvement impairments throughout the remainder of the continued economic conditions surrounding our digital media services led to other impairment charges related to the valuation of our assets acquired from discovermusic  in the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we performed an analysis of all long lived assets in accordance with our accounting policies  and determined that certain of these assets were impaired 
impairment charges were then recorded as appropriate 
as a result of these actions and other 
table of contents economic conditions  we recorded special charges of million in these charges are summarized in the table following in thousands intangible and other asset impairments property and equipment write downs facilities related charges and other employee severance intangible and other impairments 
we recorded impairments of million in related to intangibles and other long term assets 
there were no such charges recorded in we decided in to focus on areas of business that we believed had a near term opportunity to drive increases in revenue 
this decision led us to make the acquisitions described in the business overview 
this refocusing of our business led to the decision to cease supporting certain digital media applications and the alive technology platform in the first quarter of the goodwill previously recognized associated with the alive 
com acquisition and certain other digital applications were impaired and  as each of these assets had no determinable cash flows associated with them  and no discernible fair market value  the remaining unamortized balances  totaling million were written off 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we reassessed the remaining alive intangibles and recorded additional impairment charges of  and  respectively 
we had previously capitalized the cost of warrants issued to a strategic partner 
in the first quarter of  we terminated this relationship  and accordingly  recorded a charge of  related to the unamortized portion of the warrants 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed a reassessment of the carrying value of all of the company s assets  both tangible and intangible  in conjunction with the corporate forecast for and beyond 
the development of this forecast demonstrated that certain assets related to acquisitions in and were impaired  as the projected undiscounted discernible cash flows did not exceed the carrying value of the assets over the estimated useful life of those assets 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge totaling million related to intangible assets acquired from discovermusic in march increased competition  including pricing pressures and the continued economic downturn caused us to revise our initial projections for the business and subsequently write down the value originally assigned to the acquired customer list and other acquired intangibles 
while we currently project that the music samples application will generate positive cash flow  the projected cash flows do not fully recover the current carrying value of the assets in the near term  resulting in the impairment 
the assets were written down to estimated current cost to replace  which the company believes is a reliable estimate of the fair market value 
in addition  we recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of  totaling million related to the impairment of various intangibles that were recorded as a result of our online radio transactions 
through december   we had not generated significant revenues from radio customers 
our current projections for online radio related revenues have been revised and are lower than those projections that existed at the time of the acquisitions 
this revision and the general uncertainty of the current economic situation and the advertising market required us to perform an assessment of these assets 
the projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining estimated life of two years did not fully support the valuation these assets had on the balance sheet 
accordingly  we retained an outside valuation firm to assess the fair market value of these assets 
we used this as the new basis of the intangible assets and recorded the difference between the current carrying value and the assessed fair market value to special charges 
we also recorded a charge totaling million in the fourth quarter of related to the impairment of vidipax goodwill 
vidipax currently generates net cash flows from operations  however  the current projected undiscounted cash flows did not fully support the current carrying value of the related goodwill 
we estimated 
table of contents the fair market value of vidipax s long lived assets and charged the million difference between the current carrying value and the estimated fair market value to special charges 
property and equipment 
we recorded special charges of million related to property and equipment in the calendar year 
this included charges of approximately  related to previously capitalized software that we abandoned during we determined that due to the acquisition of a music samples platform from discovermusic  the previously capitalized software costs associated with loudeye s separately developed music samples platform were redundant and not recoverable 
accordingly  since the code base developed by loudeye will not be sold or otherwise used  it was determined to have no further value and the remaining unamortized cost  approximately  was adjusted to zero 
we also discontinued all sales efforts related to certain digital media applications and terminated the related development efforts 
this resulted in a full impairment and a related charge of  as we had previously disclosed  our decision in early to focus on the audio business led to a further review of our video assets 
we performed a review of the current market prices for similar used equipment and adjusted the remaining value of our video assets down to the estimated net realizable value 
we sold a significant amount of these assets at auction during the quarter ended june   at amounts approximately equal to their adjusted values 
prior to the sale  we had ceased depreciation until such time as they were actually disposed 
we also recorded third quarter of charges of  related to assets acquired from discovermusic that were abandoned due to obsolescence or otherwise unusable in our restructured business 
in conjunction with the consolidated forecast for and beyond  it became apparent that the projected undiscounted cash flows were not enough to fully recover the carrying value of our remaining property and equipment excluding those recently acquired from activate 
we then performed an analysis of all remaining property and equipment that had not been recently purchased  to determine the current fair value of the assets  in other than a forced liquidation sale 
this analysis  which was substantially generated from valuations provided by used equipment resellers led to charges of million    and million in the first through fourth quarters of  respectively 
we do not currently expect to record any future fixed asset impairments  as substantially all property and equipment of the company are now carried at current fair market value 
we expect annual depreciation expense to decrease by approximately million as a result of these write downs facilities related charges and other 
as a result of acquisition activity  the de emphasis of our video encoding operations and the reductions in force that led to excess facilities  our board of directors approved plans of facilities consolidation during the course of these plans resulted in the closure of the santa monica and london offices in early and the migration from four facilities in seattle into one facility in late and early accordingly  all unamortized leasehold improvements related to the vacated facilities  totaling million  were charged to special charges in we also have accrued for the rental payments we believe will be paid on these abandoned facilities while we seek a suitable sublessor or negotiate a termination of the lease 
related rent charges of million were recorded in  including million in the fourth quarter of  reflecting current local real estate market conditions 
as of december   we have accrued million in accrued liabilities related to estimated future rental payments 
other charges of approximately  have been recorded related to outplacement services  impaired investments and other 
we believe that the current reserve on all facilities is adequate to cover rents for the period of time until they are sublet or we negotiate an effective termination 
we therefore do not foresee additional special charges related to facilities closures 
employee severance 
we have paid severance costs of million in related to the termination of a significant number of employees 
on a quarterly basis these amounts were  million   and  in the first through fourth quarters of  respectively 
we announced a reduction in force on march  and currently expect compensation costs savings to total approximately million in the remainder of the severance costs associated with that reduction in force total approximately million and will be recorded in the first quarter of we expect annual amortization expense in to decrease by approximately million as a result of the impairment charges recorded in 
table of contents interest income 
interest income representing earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decreased income was due primarily to our lower average cash and investment balances in in addition to lower interest rates 
we expect that our interest income will decrease in the future as our cash and investment balances decrease to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest expense related to our debt instruments as well as amortization of financing charges related to our debt instruments 
this totaled million and  in and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to increased levels of borrowings incurred to finance equipment purchases and acquisitions  partially offset by decreased interest rates and the refinancing of our credit facility in year ended december  compared to revenues 
revenues totaled million and million for and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to significant large scale orders from our digital media audio customers  the benefit of our previously announced acquisition of vidipax  revenues related to our consulting services group  the initial sales of certain digital media application  and certain contractual revenues associated with forfeited deposits and contractually guaranteed minimum revenues  and the recognition of deferred revenue upon satisfaction of certain terms or the removal of our continuing obligation under such contracts 
media restoration revenues generated by our vidipax subsidiary totaled  in revenues in  as compared to none in this increase was the result of acquisition of vidipax in june we earned approximately million in revenue from the performance of the four largest audio digital media services projects in  as compared with approximately  for the four largest such projects in the increase in large audio projects was primarily driven by trends driving the demand for online music  the rapid expansion of companies and business models focused on addressing that demand  as well as the build out of our capacity in late and early to be able to handle consumer volumes 
in addition  our consulting services contributed to the increase in revenues  substantially all of which occurred in the second and third quarters of the decreasing consulting services revenue trend in late was directly related to the slowing of the development of the market for digital video media offerings of our customers 
revenues included sales or licenses totaling  of certain digital media applications during we had no software applications ready for sale in  and accordingly had no revenues 
other application related contractual revenues totaling approximately  were recognized in when contractual obligations and any uncertainties related to performance were resolved 
such arrangements have revenue guarantees based upon either our performance or the end of the particular contractual period 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to million in from million in stock based compensation charges of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively were attributable to employees included in cost of revenues and are presented in the separate operating expense line item within the statements of operations 
cost of revenues as a percent of revenues remained relatively constant from year to year 
this consistent margin was primarily due to the significant increase in the amount of fixed expenses within cost of revenues 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was consistent with increased capital expenditures  which totaled million in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was significantly offset by the lower costs associated with higher margin services  contracts and applications  as well as increased efficiencies and utilization of employees and facilities 
media restoration cost of sales totaled  in as a result of our acquisition of vidipax in june operating expenses 
total operating expenses were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
without the effect of million of stock based compensation charges and million in amortization of intangible and other long term assets  operating expenses for the year ended december  would have been million  an increase of million over the comparable amount in the same period in 
table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses totaled million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
costs of developing our music sampling service  the digital media production system and certain other digital media applications for sale or license to third parties and continued work on enhancing our proprietary automated encoding processes comprised a significant portion of research and development expenses

as of december   we had capitalized approximately million in software development costs 
through december    of these capitalized amounts had been amortized into expense 
all other research and development costs had been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in the direct sales force in  commissions paid on the increased sales over the same period in  marketing related to the launch of our music sampling service and certain digital media applications  expanded advertising and trade show related expenses as well as costs associated with negotiating rights agreements with recording companies 
stock based compensation charges of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  were attributable to employees categorized within sales and marketing and are presented in the separate operating expense line item in the statements of operations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively

stock based compensation charges totaling million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  are attributable to employees categorized within general and administrative and are presented in the separate operating expense line item in the statements of operations 
amortization of intangibles and other assets 
amortization of intangibles and other assets totaled million and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  and includes amortization of the goodwill and identified intangible assets related to past acquisitions  amortization related to the fair value of warrants granted to certain partners and the discount on the sale of common stock to akamai technologies  inc in early the increase was primarily due to the timing of the alive 
com acquisition in december and vidipax in june stock based compensation 
stock based compensation totaled million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  and consisted of million in amortization of deferred stock compensation  through december   related to stock options previously granted below deemed fair market value  million in compensation expense related to the variable accounting treatment and the subsequent termination in the third quarter of of our consultant options  a charge of  related to the acceleration of options and  in credits related to the reversal of previously amortized deferred stock compensation due to option cancellations

there was million in stock based compensation charges during the year ended december   composed of  in amortization of deferred stock compensation and  of compensation expense related to marking certain consultant options to fair value 
special charges 
in january  we announced a cost savings initiative that resulted in a  special charge being incurred in consistent with the overall market trends  we experienced decreasing demand for video services 
accordingly  in december our board of directors approved a plan to close our santa monica  california facility and reduce video production that resulted in an impairment in the value of our video encoding equipment as well as existing tenant improvements at our santa monica facility which was 
table of contents closed in the first quarter of this combined non cash impairment charge of  was included as a component of operating loss in the special charge line item within the financial statements

interest expense consists of interest expense related to our debt instruments as well as amortization of financing charges related to our debt instruments 
this totaled  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to interest on increased levels of borrowings incurred to finance property and equipment expenditures

a portion of these funds is held in an investment account that serves as collateral for our credit facility 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
for  cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from a net loss of million  partially offset by non cash charges totaling million related to depreciation and amortization  the non cash components of the special charges and stock based compensation 
additional impacts on the cash flows from operations related to a decrease of million in accounts receivable  an increase in accrued compensation  benefits and other expenses of million and a decrease of approximately million in accounts payable 
all changes in operating assets and liabilities are net of amounts acquired in purchases of businesses 
cash used in operating activities in was due primarily to a net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by an increase in accrued compensation  benefits and other expenses of million and non cash stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization charges totaling million

cash used in investing activities in was primarily related to purchases of investments  property and equipment  cash paid for acquisition of businesses and capitalized software costs 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities in primarily resulted from the funds received from our new credit facility of million  offset by principal payments of our long term debt and capital lease obligations of million 
we repurchased million shares from our founder for million and also made a secured loan of million to him in the details of these arrangements are provided in the footnotes to financial statements in item net cash provided by financing activities in primarily resulted from the net proceeds of our initial public offering  the concurrent sale of common shares to a strategic investor  and the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option 
as of december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases  capital leases and credit facilities with our banks 
on august   we entered into a credit agreement with a bank providing for a revolving credit facility and letters of credit aggregating up to million to be used for working capital and general corporate needs  and to refinance existing long term debt 
on october   the credit agreement was amended to increase the principal sum to million 
obligations under the credit agreement are collateralized by a security interest in an investment account that 
table of contents must hold short term investments and cash equivalents with a value of at least million 
the revolving facility requires monthly payments of interest only until maturity on july  on july   we have an option to extend the maturity date to july   provided that we are not in default at that time 
at december   million was outstanding under the revolving facility 
approximately million of the proceeds were utilized to pay off an existing line of credit and term loan facility with another bank 
loans under the revolving facility bear interest  at our option  at the bank s prime rate  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points 
our interest rate on the outstanding principal balance was in the interest rates will be adjusted after the libor term to reflect the libor rate in effect at that time 
we have multiple other credit facilities and leasing arrangements that  in general  are not prepayable without penalty 
total amounts outstanding under these arrangements are million as of december  the interest rates on these instruments range from to 
the instruments have various maturity rates through november letters of credit of approximately  back certain of these notes and capital lease obligations 
on march   we announced a realignment of management and operations following the completion of the activate consolidation 
this approximately reduction in force is expected to result in estimated total savings of million annually and cost an additional  to million in related severance and outplacement services 
since our inception  our operating expenses have significantly increased in order to support our growth 
we currently anticipate that such expenses will continue to be a material use of our cash resources 
we expect that the following items may be a significant use of our capital resources in capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  are expected to total approximately million in the remainder of calendar year and will relate primarily to the facilities consolidation and normal operating asset replacements acquisition consideration resulting from the activate 
net acquisition in september  totaling million is due in september this can be settled in a combination of stock and cash see note to the financial statements 
additional commitments are outstanding under the existing facilities leases that have previously been expensed by us in the special charges 
we expect to pay approximately million in in rental charges for the facilities that we no longer occupy 
under our loan agreement with martin tobias  we extended  in loans during the first quarter of  and may extend up to an additional  in we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements during thereafter  if we cannot fund operating and other expenses  working capital and capital expenditure requirements from our operations  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing  sell assets or reduce spending plans 
in the event additional equity or debt financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms  or at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangibles will be evaluated against the new criteria and may result in certain intangibles being subsumed into goodwill  or alternatively  amounts initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and recognized apart from goodwill 
the company believes that the implementation of sfas no 
and will require reclassification of approximately  of intangibles with indefinite lives into goodwill and there will be no reclassification 
table of contents from goodwill into identified intangibles 
sfas no 
requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its estimated fair value 
the provisions of each statement that apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to june  will be adopted by the company on january  the adoption of sfas no 
will result in the company s discontinuation of amortization of its goodwill  however  the company will be required to test its goodwill for impairment under the new standard beginning in the first quarter of  which could have an adverse effect on the company s future results of operations if an impairment occurs 
the company currently has net goodwill of approximately million at december  the company expects the impact of implementation of these two standards to have a positive net future impact resulting from the decrease in amortization by approximately million in in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for the company on january  this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and other related accounting guidance 
the company believes this will have no impact 
critical accounting policies we have identified the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
long lived assets 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
when doing so  management is required evaluate the recoverability of an asset s or group of assets carrying value through estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
if the asset or asset is deemed impaired  the assets are written down to estimated fair value 
there is a risk that projected cash flows may be different than actual cash flows  particularly in light of the rapidly changing environment in which the company operates  or that the estimates of fair value differ from the actual amount that could be realized if the company were to sell its assets 
exit costs 
the company follows the provisions of eitf to record the costs associated with exit activities 
management is required to make its best estimates of exit costs such as remaining lease obligations and or termination fees  these estimates may be different than the actual amounts that will be paid under existing lease arrangements 
revenue recognition 
the company generates revenues primarily from two sources digital media services  licensing and selling digital media applications and media restoration services 
digital media services and other 
the company recognizes enterprise webcasting services revenues as services are rendered 
we recognize encoding services revenues when the services have been rendered and the company has no continuing involvement in the goods and services delivered  which generally is the date the finished media is shipped to the customer 
other revenues are generated from our music samples service business and in the prior year from licensing and selling of software and through application service provider arrangements 
we sell services in application service provider arrangements 
we are required to host the applications and the customer does not have the ability to have the application hosted by another entity without penalty to the customer 
billings are made based upon quantity of content streamed  and revenue is recognized as the services are delivered 
media restoration services 
we recognize revenues as services are rendered and we have no continuing involvement in the goods and services delivered  which generally is the date the finished media is shipped to the customer 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 

table of contents risk factors we have a limited operating history  making it difficult for you to evaluate our business and your investment loudeye was formed as a limited liability company in august and incorporated in march following our acquisition of activate in  we began to place greater emphasis on our enterprise webcasting services 
we therefore still have a very limited operating history upon which an investor may evaluate our operations and future prospects  as well as limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
in addition  the revenue and income potential of our business and market are unproven 
because of the emerging nature of the industry  our executives have limited experience in it 
as a young company operating in an emerging industry  we face risks and uncertainties relating to our ability to implement our business plan successfully 
our potential for future profitability must be considered in light of these risks  uncertainties and difficulties 
our quarterly financial results will continue to fluctuate making it difficult to forecast our operating results our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including variability in demand for our webcasting services and our other digital media services and applications  market acceptance of new webcasting and other digital media services and applications offered by us and our competitors  ability of our customers to procure necessary intellectual property rights for the digital media content they intend to utilize in their businesses  willingness of our customers to enter into longer term volume digital media and applications service agreements and purchase orders in light of the economic and legal uncertainties related to their business models  governmental regulations affecting use of the internet  including regulations concerning intellectual property rights and security measures  or competition from other companies entering our markets 
our limited operating history and unproven business model further contribute to the difficulty of making meaningful quarterly comparisons and forecasts 
our current and future levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures are based largely on our growth plans and estimates of expected future revenues 
these expenditure levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term and our sales cycle can be lengthy 
thus  we may not be able to adjust spending or generate new revenue sources in a timely manner to compensate for any shortfall in revenues and any significant shortfall in revenues relative to planned expenditures could have an immediate adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future periods  our stock price will likely decline significantly 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us  we may be unable to execute our business plan and current stockholders may experience significant dilution as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million of which is used as collateral for our credit facility 
we believe that our existing and available funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for our operations  working capital  debt service and capital expenditures through thereafter  we may need to raise additional funds 
we may have to 
table of contents raise funds even sooner in order to fund more rapid expansion  to develop new or enhanced services or products  to respond to competitive pressures  to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies or otherwise to respond to unanticipated requirements 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced and these securities may have rights and preferences superior to that of our current stockholders 
if we raise capital through debt financing  we may be forced to accept restrictions affecting our liquidity  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or pay dividends 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on favorable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to pursue our business objectives 
this inability could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because we expect to continue to incur net losses  we may not be able to implement our business strategy and the price of our stock may decline we have incurred quarterly net losses totaling million from august  inception through december   and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may increase our operating expenses and capital expenditures in the future as we attempt to expand our webcasting services  digital media service and application offerings  enter into licensing agreements with copyright holders  grow our customer base  enhance our brand image and improve our technology infrastructure 
this would likely increase our quarterly net losses and negative cash flows 
accordingly  our ability to operate our business and implement our business strategy may be hampered by our future negative cash flows  and the value of our stock may decline as a result 
our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if  for example  we incur unforeseen capital expenditures  unforeseen operating expenses or make investments to maintain our competitive position 
if this is the case  we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development plans or otherwise forego market opportunities 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to be profitable in the future and we may not generate sufficient revenues to be profitable on either a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
to address the risks an uncertainties facing our business strategy  we must  among other things achieve broad customer adoption and acceptance of our products and services  successfully integrate our acquisition of activate and execute our webcasting services strategy  successfully integrate  leverage and expand our sales force  incorporate our online radio technology strategy  successfully scale our current operations  implement and execute our business and marketing strategies  address copyright issues that effect our business  develop and maintain strategic relationships to enhance our products and services  respond to competitive developments in the digital media infrastructure industry  we might not be successful in achieving any or all of these objectives in a cost effective manner  if at all  and the failure to achieve these could have a serious adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial position 
each of these objectives may require significant additional expenditures on our part 
even if we ultimately do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 

table of contents our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and is likely to be subject to national market listing compliance proceedings with nasdaq the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
for example  during the week period ended march   the price of our common stock ranged from to per share 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  to actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  competitors announcements  changes in recommendations by securities analysts  and conditions in the digital media services markets 
if our stock price falls below per share for consecutive trading days or certain other conditions are met  we may receive notice from nasdaq that we need to comply with the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq national market within calendar days from such notification or be moved to and be traded on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if our stock is delisted from the national market  an investor could find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of  our common stock 
additionally  our stock may be subject to penny stock regulations 
our success is dependent on the performance and retention of our executive officers and key employees our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees  all of whom are employed on an at will basis and have worked together for only a relatively short period of time 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
in addition  we have hired or named new employees in in key executive positions  including our john baker  our chief executive officer  and joel mcconaughy  our senior vice president and chief technical officer 
the loss of one or several key executives could seriously harm our business 
any reorganization or reduction in the size of our employee base could harm our ability to attract and retain other valuable employees critical to the success of our business 
acquisitions we have made or may make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition we expect to continue to evaluate and acquire businesses  technologies  services  or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
in december  we acquired alive 
com  inc  in june we acquired vidipax  inc  in june we acquired addition systems  inc  in march we acquired discovermusic  and in september we acquired activate 
we have also acquired certain assets and technology from onair and thedial 
com 
we have limited operating history as a combined company and therefore limited experience in addressing emerging trends that may affect our combined business 
the integration of these and any future acquisitions into our operations may place a significant strain on our employees  systems and other resources 
if any acquisition fails to integrate well  our operations and financial position could be harmed 
acquisitions require integrating the business  personnel  technology and products of the acquired entity and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
in addition  acquisitions may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will be realized 
acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business  or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and the incurrence of large and immediate write offs  any of which could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our acquisition of activate could cause significant dilution to existing stockholders which could decrease the trading price of our common stock as a result of the activate acquisition  we will be required to make payments totaling million on or about september  pursuant to the merger agreement  we can make this payment in either cash or stock or a combination of the two  provided  however  we may not issue more than of our outstanding capital stock in payment of such obligation  calculated post issuance 
our existing stockholders  therefore  
table of contents could face significant dilution if we elect to issue the maximum permissible amount of stock in making such payment 
we are dependent on the development and rate of adoption of digital media and the delay or failure of this development would seriously harm our business we are dependent on the development and rate of adoption of digital media services and applications and the delay or failure of this development would seriously harm our business 
the development of commercial services and applications for digital media content is in its relatively early stages 
if the internet does not develop as an effective medium for the distribution of digital media content to consumers or if businesses predicated on the distribution of digital media content are not profitable or are unable to raise necessary operating capital  then we may not succeed in executing our business plan 
many factors could inhibit the growth of the distribution of digital media content  including concerns about the profitability of internet related businesses  uncertainty about intellectual property rights associated with music and other digital media  bandwidth constraints  piracy and privacy 
our success depends on users having access to the necessary hardware  software and bandwidth  or data transmission capability  to receive and broadcast high quality digital media over the internet 
congestion over the internet and data loss may interrupt audio and video streams  resulting in unsatisfying user experiences 
the success of digital media distribution over the internet depends on the continued rollout of broadband access to consumers on an affordable basis 
widespread adoption of digital media technology depends on overcoming obstacles to the deployment and use of digital media software  identifying additional viable revenue models for digital media based businesses  improving audio and video quality and educating customers and users in the use of digital media technology 
if digital media technology fails to overcome these obstacles  our business could be seriously harmed 
because digital recorded music formats  such as mp  do not always contain mechanisms for tracking the source or ownership of digital recordings  users are able to download and distribute unauthorized or pirated copies of copyrighted recorded music over the internet 
this piracy is a significant concern to record companies and artists  and is the reason many record companies and artists are reluctant to digitally deliver their recorded music over the internet 
as long as pirated recordings are available  many consumers will choose free pirated recordings rather than paying for legitimate recordings 
accordingly  if this issue is not addressed  our business might be harmed 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a majority of our revenues so the loss of  or delay in payment from  one or a small number of customers could have a significant impact on our revenues and operating results a limited number of customers have accounted for a majority of our revenues and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
during the year ended december   one of our customers accounted for of our revenues and during the year ended december   two of our customers accounted for approximately of our revenues 
we believe that a small number of customers may continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
due to high revenue concentration among a limited number of customers  the cancellation  reduction or delay of a large customer order or our failure to timely complete or deliver a project during a given quarter is likely to significantly reduce revenues 
in addition  if any significant customer fails to pay amounts it owes us  or does not pay those amounts on time  our revenues and operating results could suffer 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing and broadening our customer base  our business could be harmed 
average selling prices of our products and services may decrease  which may harm our gross margins the average selling prices of our products and services may be lower than expected as a result of competitive pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers who negotiate price reductions in exchange for longer term purchase commitments or otherwise 
the pricing of services sold to our customers depends on the duration of the agreement  the specific requirements of the order  purchase volumes  the sales 
table of contents and service support and other contractual agreements 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience pricing pressure and anticipate that the average selling prices and gross margins for our products will decrease over product life cycles 
we may not be successful in developing and introducing on a timely basis new products with enhanced features that can be sold at higher gross margins 
we may be liable or alleged to be liable to third parties for music  software  and other content that we encode  distribute  or make available on to our customers we may be liable or alleged to be liable to third parties for the content that we encode  distribute or make available to our customers if the content or the performance of our services violates third party copyright  trademark  or other intellectual property rights  if our customers violate the intellectual property rights of others by providing content to us or by having us perform digital media services  or if content that we encode or otherwise handle for our customers is deemed obscene  indecent  or defamatory 
any alleged liability could harm our business by damaging our reputation  requiring us to incur legal costs in defense  exposing us to awards of damages and costs and diverting management s attention which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our customers for encoding services generally agree to hold us harmless from claims arising from their failure to have the right to encode the content given to us for that purpose 
however  customers may contest this responsibility or not have sufficient resources to defend claims and we have limited insurance coverage for claims of this nature 
because we host  stream and webcast audio and video content on or from our web site and on other web sites for customers and provide services related to digital media content  we face potential liability or alleged liability for negligence  infringement of copyright  patent  or trademark rights  defamation  indecency and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials we host 
claims of this nature have been brought  and sometimes successfully pressed  against content distributors 
in addition  we could be exposed to liability with respect to the unauthorized duplication of content or unauthorized use of other parties proprietary technology 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage or any alleged liability could harm our business 
we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to past  current  or future technologies 
the music industry in particular has recently been the focus of infringement claims 
we expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in our industry segment grows 
in addition  these risks are difficult to quantify in light of the continuously evolving nature of laws and regulations governing the internet 
any claim relating to proprietary rights  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause service upgrade delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  and we can not assure you that we will have adequate insurance coverage or that royalty or licensing agreements will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property  and we may be found to infringe on proprietary rights of others  which could harm our business our intellectual property is important to our business  and we seek to protect our intellectual property through copyrights  trademarks  patents  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions in our customer  supplier and strategic relationship agreements  nondisclosure agreements with third parties  and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors 
we cannot assure you that measures we take to protect our intellectual property will be successful or that third parties will not develop alternative solutions that do not infringe upon our intellectual property 

table of contents in addition  we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by others 
potential customers may be deterred from distributing content over the internet for fear of infringement claims 
the music industry in particular has recently been the focus of heightened concern with respect to copyright infringement and other misappropriation claims  and the outcome of developing legal standards in that industry is expected to impact music  video and other content being distributed over the internet 
if  as a result  potential customers forego distributing traditional media content over the internet  demand for our digital media services and applications could be reduced which would harm our business 
the music industry in the us is generally regarded as extremely litigious in nature compared to other industries and we could become engaged in litigation with others in the music industry 
claims against us  and any resultant litigation  should it occur in regard to any of our digital media services and applications  could subject us to significant liability for damages including treble damages for willful infringement 
in addition  even if we prevail  litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and attention 
any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims 
further  we plan to offer our digital media services and applications to customers worldwide including customers in foreign countries that may offer less protection for our intellectual property than the united states 
our failure to protect against misappropriation of our intellectual property  or claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of third parties could have a negative effect on our business  revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
a class action lawsuit has been filed against us which may result in litigation that is costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and may harm our business we and certain of our current or former officers and directors are named as defendants in a purported class action complaint which has been filed allegedly on behalf of certain persons who purchased our common stock during the time period beginning on march  and ending on december  the complaint alleges violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of primarily it alleges that there was undisclosed compensation received by our underwriters in connection with our initial public offering 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this matter 
any resolution of this matter in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operation 
in addition  the costs to us of defending any litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation or other proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
in addition  because class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in their stock prices  we could become involved in additional litigation 
we rely on strategic relationships to promote our services and for access to licensed technology  if we fail to maintain or enhance these relationships  our ability to serve our customers and develop new services and applications could be harmed our ability to provide our services to users of multiple technologies and platforms depends significantly on our ability to develop and maintain our strategic relationships with key streaming media technology companies and content providers 
we rely on these relationships for licensed technology and content 
we also rely on relationships with major recording labels for our music content licensing strategy 
obtaining comprehensive music content licenses is challenging  as doing so may require us to obtain copyright licenses with various third parties in the fragmented music recording and publishing industries 
these copyrights often address differing activities related to the delivery of digital media  including reproduction and performance  some of which may require separate licensing arrangements from various rights holders such as publishers  artists and record labels 
the effort to obtain the necessary rights by such third parties is often significant  and could disrupt  delay  or prevent us from executing our business plans 
because of the large number of potential parties from which we must obtain licenses  we may never be able to obtain a sufficient number of licenses to allow us to provide services that will meet our customers expectations 

table of contents due to the evolving nature of our industry  we will need to develop additional relationships to adapt to changing technologies and standards and to work with newly emerging companies with whom we do not have pre existing relationships 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing new relationships or that our partners will view these relationships as significant to their own business or that they will continue their commitment to us in the future 
if we are unable to maintain or enhance these relationships  we may have difficulty strengthening our technology development and increasing the adoption of our brand and services 
our music content licenses could result in operational complexity that may divert resources or make our business more expensive to conduct the large number of licenses that we need to maintain in order to expand our music related services creates operational difficulties in connection with tracking the rights that we have acquired and the complex royalty structures under which we must pay 
in addition  our licensing agreements typically allow the third party to audit our royalty tracking and payment mechanisms to ensure that we are accurately reporting and paying the royalties owed 
if we are unable to accurately track the numerous parties that we must pay in connection with each delivery of digital music services and deliver the appropriate payment in a timely fashion  we may risk termination of certain licenses 
competition may decrease our market share  revenues  and gross margins we face intense and increasing competition in the digital media services market 
if we do not compete effectively or if we experience reduced market share from increased competition  our business will be harmed 
in addition  the more successful we are in the emerging market for digital media services  the more competitors are likely to emerge 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include service functionality  quality and performance  ease of use  reliability  scalability and security of services  establishing a significant base of customers and distribution partners  ability to introduce new services to the market in a timely manner  customer service and support  attracting third party web developers  and pricing 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our digital media services  there are two principal types of companies we do compete with enterprise webcasting companies and digital media services companies 
enterprise webcasting competition 
our primary competitors are content distribution networks  such as akamai and ibeam  and internet broadcasters  such as yahoo broadcast 
each of these companies provide services similar to ours and each has a well established market presence 
we also compete with providers of traditional communications technologies  such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  as well as applications software and tools companies  such as centra software  evoke communications  lotus sametime  microsoft netmeeting and placeware 
there are also smaller competitors that focus on certain of our individual market segments  such as investor relations webcasts 
other digital media services competition 
there are a number of companies that provide outsourced digital media services 
as the digital media services market continues to develop  we expect to see increased competition from traditional telecommunication service providers or resellers of those services 
we also face competition from the in house encoding services  streaming networks and content management systems and encoding services 

table of contents many of our competitors have substantially more capital  longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive development of their technologies  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and establish more comprehensive marketing and advertising campaigns than we can 
our competitors may develop products and service offerings that we do not offer or that are more sophisticated or more cost effective than our own 
for these and other reasons  our competitors products and services may achieve greater acceptance in the marketplace than our own  limiting our ability to gain market share and customer loyalty and to generate sufficient revenues to achieve a profitable level of operations 
our failure to adequately address any of the above factors could harm our business and operating results 
our industry is experiencing consolidation that may intensify competition the internet and digital media services industries are undergoing substantial change that has resulted in increasing consolidation and a proliferation of strategic transactions 
many companies in these industries have been going out of business or are being acquired by larger entities 
as a result  we are increasingly competing with larger competitors that have substantially greater resources than we do 
we expect this consolidation and strategic partnering to continue 
acquisitions or strategic relationships could harm us in a number of ways 
for example competitors could acquire or enter into relationships with companies with which we have strategic relationships and discontinue our relationship  resulting in the loss of distribution opportunities for our products and services or the loss of certain enhancements or value added features to our products and services  competitors could obtain exclusive access to desirable multimedia content and prevent that content from being available in certain formats  thus decreasing the use of our products and services to distribute and experience the content that audiences most desire  and hurting our ability to attract customers  suppliers of important or emerging technologies could be acquired by a competitor or other company which could prevent us from being able to utilize such technologies in our offerings  and disadvantage our offerings relative to those of competitors  a competitor could be acquired by a party with significant resources and experience that could increase the ability of the competitor to compete with our products and services  and other companies with related interests could combine to form new  formidable competition  which could preclude us from obtaining access to certain markets or content  or which could dramatically change the market for our products and services 
any of these results could put us at a competitive disadvantage that could cause us to lose customers  revenue and market share 
they could also force us to expend greater resources to meet the competitive threat  which could also harm our operating results 
if we fail to enhance our existing services and applications products or develop and introduce new digital media services  applications and features in a timely manner to meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry trends or standards  our ability to grow our business will suffer the market for digital media service solutions is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and short product life cycles 
these market characteristics are heightened by the emerging nature of the internet and the continuing trend of companies from many industries to offer internet based applications and services 
the widespread adoption of the new internet  networking  streaming media  or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our operating practices or infrastructure 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights from music companies and other content owners to be able to legally provide our services  
table of contents identify and respond to emerging technological trends in the market  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our digital media services and applications from those of our competitors  acquire and license leading technologies  bring digital media services and applications to market and scale our business on a timely basis at competitive prices  and respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new services and applications or enhancements to existing services and applications that meet evolving industry standards and customer needs 
in the future  we may not be able to address effectively the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards 
the technical innovations required for us to remain competitive are inherently complex  require long development schedules and are dependent in some cases on sole source suppliers 
we will be required to continue to invest in research and development in order to attempt to maintain and enhance our existing technologies and products  but we may not have the funds available to do so 
even if we have sufficient funds  these investments may not serve the needs of customers or be compatible with changing technological requirements or standards 
most development expenses must be incurred before the technical feasibility or commercial viability of new or enhanced services and applications can be ascertained 
revenue from future services and applications or enhancements to services and applications may not be sufficient to recover the associated development costs 
the technology underlying our services and applications is complex and may contain unknown defects that could harm our reputation  result in product liability or decrease market acceptance of our services and applications the technology underlying our digital media services and applications is complex and includes software that is internally developed and software licensed from third parties 
these software products may contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
we may not discover software defects that affect our current or new services and applications or enhancements until after they are sold 
furthermore  because our digital media services are designed to work in conjunction with various platforms and applications  we are susceptible to errors or defects in third party applications that can result in a lower quality product for our customers 
because our customers depend on us for digital media management  any interruptions could damage our reputation  cause our customers to initiate product liability suits against us  increase our product development resources  cause us to lose sales  and delay market acceptance of our digital media services and applications 
we do not possess product liability insurance  and our errors and omissions coverage is not likely to be sufficient to cover our complete liability exposure 
our business will suffer if our systems fail or our operations facilities become unavailable a reduction in the performance  reliability and availability of our systems and network infrastructure may harm our ability to distribute our products and services to our customers and other users  as well as harm our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers and content providers 
our systems and operations are susceptible to  and could be damaged or interrupted by  outages caused by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  internet breakdown  earthquake and similar events 
we do not have any redundancy in our webcasting facilities and therefore any damage or destruction to these would significantly 
table of contents harm our webcasting business 
our systems are also subject to human error  security breaches  power losses  computer viruses  break ins  denial of service attacks  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and tampering designed to disrupt our computer systems  web sites and network communications 
a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our web sites could strain the capacity of the software  hardware and telecommunications systems that we deploy or use 
this could lead to slower response times or system failures 
our operations also depend on receipt of timely feeds from our content providers  and any failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of such feeds could disrupt our operations 
we also depend on web browsers  isps and online service providers to provide access over the internet to our product and service offerings 
many of these providers have experienced significant outages or interruptions in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
these types of interruptions could continue or increase in the future 
our digital distribution activities are managed by sophisticated software and computer systems 
we must continually develop and update these systems over time as our business and business needs grow and change  and these systems may not adequately reflect the current needs of our business 
we may encounter delays in developing these systems  and the systems may contain undetected errors that could cause system failures 
any system error or failure that causes interruption in availability of products or content or an increase in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing business services customers  users  advertisers or content providers 
if we suffer sustained or repeated interruptions  our products  services and web sites could be less attractive to such entities or individuals and our business could be harmed 
significant portions of our business are dependent on providing customers with efficient and reliable services to enable customers to broadcast content to large audiences on a live or on demand basis 
our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers 
any failure of such network providers to provide the capacity we require may result in a reduction in  or interruption of  service to our customers 
if we do not have access to third party transmission capacity  we could lose customers and if we are unable to obtain such capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us  our business and operating results could suffer 
our computer and communications infrastructure is located at a single leased facility in seattle  washington  an area that is at heightened risk of earthquake and volcanic events 
we do not have fully redundant systems  and we may not have adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage 
despite our efforts  our network infrastructure and systems could be subject to service interruptions or damage and any resulting interruption of services could harm our business  operating results and reputation 
because our principal stockholders and management may have the ability to control a significant percentage of stockholder votes  the premium over market price that an acquiror might otherwise pay may be reduced and any merger or takeover may be prevented or delayed our officers and directors beneficially own or control the voting of approximately of our outstanding common stock 
martin tobias  our former chief executive officer and former member of the board of directors  has given the board of directors  an irrevocable proxy to vote all of the approximately million shares of our common stock that he owns 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements and our report on form k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on october  for a more complete description of the proxy 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  have the ability to substantially influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including election or removal of our board of directors  amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  and adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger  takeover or other business combination involving us 

table of contents these stockholders have substantial influence over our management and our affairs 
accordingly  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business consolidation involving us  or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares 
this concentration of ownership could also adversely affect our stock s market price or lessen any premium over market price that an acquiror might otherwise pay 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the provisions of delaware law could also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an acquisition of loudeye  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
see description of capital stock for more information on our charter and by law provisions 
government regulation could adversely affect our business prospects we do not know with certainty how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright and other intellectual property issues  taxation  illegal or obscene content  retransmission of media  personal privacy and data protection will apply to the internet or to the distribution of music and other proprietary content over the internet 
most of these laws were adopted before the advent of the internet and related technologies and therefore do not address the unique issues associated with the internet and related technologies 
depending on how these laws developed and are interpreted by the judicial system  they could have the effect of limiting the growth of the internet  creating uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for our products and services  increasing our cost of doing business  exposing us to significant liabilities associated with content distributed or accessed through our products or services  or leading to increased product and applications development costs  or otherwise harm our business 
specifically with respect to one aspect of copyright law  on october   the digital millennium copyright act or dmca was enacted 
the dmca includes statutory licenses for the performance of sound recordings and for the making of recordings to facilitate transmissions 
under these statutory licenses  depending on our future business activities  we and our customers may be required to pay licensing fees in connection with digital sound recordings we deliver or our customers provide on their web site and through retransmissions of radio broadcasts and or other audio content 
a copyright arbitration royalty panel has determined that  for eligible non subscription services  sound recording performance rates should be per performance for the period october  with a surcharge of of the total performance fee for the ephemeral copies used to facilitate such performances 
however  that decision is subject to review and revision by the us copyright office  and several appeal petitions have been filed 
furthermore  the copyright office s review is subject to an appeal to a federal court of appeals 
the fees for the same types of transmissions offered on a subscription basis have not been determined and will be the subject of another copyright arbitration royalty panel proceeding  as will fees for digital phono record deliveries pursuant to the mechanical license provisions of the us copyright act 
depending on the rates and terms adopted for the statutory licenses  our business could be harmed both by increasing our own cost of doing business  and by increasing the cost of doing business for our customers 
because of this rapidly evolving and uncertain regulatory environment  both domestically and internationally  we cannot predict how existing or proposed laws and regulations might affect our business 
in addition  these uncertainties make it difficult to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations governing digital music 
these laws and regulations could harm us by subjecting us to liability or forcing us to change our business 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide internet media infrastructure services and applications 
our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the stock market 
as substantially all sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our services less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our risks 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since substantially all of our investments are in short term instruments with original maturities of less than six months 
due to the limited duration of our short term investments and their investment grade level  we anticipate no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are presented 
we invest in investment grade government obligations  institutional money market funds and other obligations with fdic insured us banks 
concentration is limited to in any one instrument or issuer 
our primary investment focus is to preserve capital and earn a market rate of return on our investments 
we do not speculate nor invest in publicly traded equity securities and therefore do not believe that our capital is subject to material market risk 
the average portfolio balance must remain under one year in duration
