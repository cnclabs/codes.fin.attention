item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors that may affect our performance and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide technology driven internet audience measurement information solutions for media and commerce 
our products and services enable our customers to make informed business critical decisions regarding their internet strategies 
our customers include leading advertising agencies  media companies  financial services institutions  e commerce companies and traditional marketers requiring analysis of the online environment 
we have formed strategic relationships with nielsen media research  the leading source of television audience measurement and related services in the united states  and acnielsen  a leading global provider of market research information and analysis 
we believe that these relationships enable us to offer the most accurate and globally comprehensive internet audience information currently available 
international operations we conduct our international operations primarily through joint ventures 
we have a joint venture  eratings  with acnielsen to develop and maintain internet audience measurement panels and to market products and services under the nielsen netratings brand in other key international markets 
as of december  we held a ownership interest and acnielsen held the remaining 
we and acnielsen are each required to either make capital contributions to the joint venture in proportion to our ownership interests to fund its ongoing operating expenses or to allow the other party to make such capital contributions unilaterally which would dilute our ownership position 
as of december   we held a direct ownership interest in netratings japan  eratings  our joint venture partner  held a ownership interest  and the remaining ownership interest was held by various japanese investors 
in january  we established a joint venture in france  mediametrie eratings 
com  in which we held a ownership interest as of december   eratings held a ownership interest  and mediametrie held the remaining ownership interest 
we and the other owners of mediametrie eratings 
com  each make quarterly capital contributions in proportion to our ownership interests in the joint venture to fund its ongoing operating expenses 
through our strategic relationships and our joint ventures  we provided the nielsen netratings service in countries as of december  however  we currently anticipate that  during  our eratings joint venture will reduce the number of countries in which it reports internet audience measurement data to between and countries 
recent developments on october   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with jupiter media metrix  inc jupiter  providing for us to acquire jupiter in exchange for approximately million in cash and stock  subject to certain reductions 
on february   we and jupiter media metrix announced our mutual termination of the agreement and plan of merger 
neither company was required to pay a breakup fee and each company was generally responsible for its own acquisition related expenses 
we currently anticipate acquisition related expenses to total between and million  of which approximately million was incurred and included as deferred acquisition costs on the balance sheet as of december  as a result of the mutual termination  we will expense these charges in the first quarter of also on october   we entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization with acnielsen corporation providing for netratings to acquire acnielsen s percent stake in acnielsen eratings 
com  or eratings  a company that has been operated as a joint venture between acnielsen and us since the closing of this acquisition was expressly conditioned upon the closing of our acquisition of jupiter media metrix  and the agreement was subject to termination should our agreement with jupiter media metrix be terminated prior to closing 
as a result of the termination of our agreement with jupiter media metrix  we and acnielsen mutually elected to terminate our agreement to acquire the remainder of eratings 
however  we are continuing to evaluate the potential advantages of a consolidation of our domestic service offerings with the international service offerings conducted by eratings 
we currently anticipate acquisition related expenses to total between and million  of which approximately million was incurred and included on the balance sheet as of december  as a result of the mutual termination  we will expense these charges in the first quarter of the acquisition related costs include our share  as defined in the acquisition agreement  of costs incurred by eratings to reduce the number of countries in which it reports internet audience measurement services 
on february   we announced a restructuring plan intended to streamline our business to focus on core products  refine our product line  and implement a reduction in our workforce 
in the first quarter of  we also completed the previously announced transition of william pulver to president  ceo  and board member  simultaneous with the resignation of ceo  founder  and board member  david toth 
we also announced the promotion of sean kaldor  vp of analytics and corporate marketing and client analytics  barbara jarzab  vice president and chief of measurement science  and george durney  senior vice president of sales as well as the addition of manish bhatia  senior vice president of product marketing and business development 
simultaneous with these announcements we announced the resignation of tim meadows  executive vice president of products and services and a founder of the company 
we have refocused our team on developing and enhancing our core products and have discontinued the sale and development of two products  adspectrum and ecommercepulse 
additionally  we have consolidated our use of facility space to approximately  square feet of the  square feet available under our milpitas lease 
we anticipate annualized cost savings of between million and million as a result of these changes and expect to incur a one time charge of between and million in the first quarter of to cover reorganization and workforce reduction costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  our management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  investments  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies  and litigation 
our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgment regarding the collectibility of those fees 
we primarily sell these products and services pursuant to one year subscription agreements and bill our customers in advance  typically on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our information and analytical products and services ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
prepaid subscription fees are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
if a contract s collectibility comes into question  revenue recognition is discontinued until collectibility is reasonably assured 
this determination is based on our management s judgment and could adversely affect both revenue and deferred revenue 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make contractually required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and such allowances are based on management s judgment 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note of our financial statements 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses  in accordance with fas a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual case 
we do not believe the outcomes to these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
nonetheless  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategy related to these proceedings 
investments in debt and equity securities we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within or adjacent to our strategic focus and these entities are non publicly traded companies whose value is difficult to determine 
for those investments accounted for based on the cost method  we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
for those investments accounted for based on the equity method  we reduce our investment in accordance with our equity in each joint venture s loss and record a corresponding loss on joint ventures in our statement of operations 
the equity basis is adjusted for any additional capital contributions or commitments 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments and such amounts that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
accounting overview we generate revenue primarily from the sale of our internet audience measurement products and services 
we sell our products and services to customers in a wide range of industries 
as of december   over customers worldwide  including over domestically  had contracts in place with either us or our joint ventures for the nielsen netratings service 
through december   our information and analytical products and services  which include our audience measurement services  ecommerce services  and media and advertising services  have accounted for substantially all of our revenue 
we primarily sell these products and services pursuant to one year subscription agreements and bill our customers in advance  typically on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our information and analytical products and services ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
therefore a significant portion of revenue recognized in any period results from the amortization of deferred revenue balances 
prepaid subscription fees are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from the sale of custom research services and royalty payments from our strategic and joint venture partners 
revenue from custom services is recognized in the period in which the service is provided 
cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses related to the recruitment  maintenance  and support of our us and canadian internet audience measurement panels  which are expensed as they are incurred  as well as operational costs related to our data center 
accordingly  such expenses are not matched with any revenue or subscriptions generated in a given period and are higher in periods in which we are involved in significant panel development activities 
also included in cost of revenue are the data acquisition costs related to our joint ventures  which are recognized ratably over the term of the customer s subscription agreement  as the data is provided  and the royalty fees associated with certain data partnering agreements 
we expect cost of revenue will decrease in future periods as a result of the discontinuation of adspectrum and ecommercepulse and related royalty payments 
we anticipate that our household panel size may decrease as a result of natural attrition and as we focus increasingly on our at work and combo panel development 
we do not anticipate this decrease to have a material adverse impact on the quality of our services 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel associated with our research and product development activities 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in product development is critical to achieving our strategic objectives 
however  we expect that research and development expenses will decrease during the first quarter of due to a reduction in discretionary expenses related to research and development programs as well as the reduction in force announced on february  sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  and commissions to our salespeople and analysts  commissions paid to nielsen media research  as well as costs related to seminars  promotional materials  public relations  advertising  and other sales and marketing programs 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will decrease during the next quarter due to a reduction in expenses related to marketing programs as well as the reduction in force announced on february  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for executive management  finance  accounting  human resources  legal  information technology and other administrative personnel  in addition to professional fees  provisions for doubtful accounts  and other general corporate expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase during the next quarter due primarily to an increase in legal fees associated with our pending patent litigation 
we expect this increase to be offset in part by a reduction in expenses resulting from our reduction in force announced on february  in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees  we recorded non cash stock based compensation charges of million as of the year ended december  representing the difference between the exercise price of these options and the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant 
these amounts are being amortized over the respective vesting periods of the options using a graded vesting method 
also in  in connection with certain agreements with nielsen media research governing our strategic relationship  we also issued two warrants to nielsen media research  with respect to which we recorded non cash stock based compensation charges of million for the year ended december  representing the black scholes value of these warrants 
these charges are being amortized over five years 
we have also recognized  in additional non cash stock based compensation charges through the year ended december  related to the acceleration of certain vesting periods associated with specific severance agreements 
we recognized non cash amortization of these stock compensation charges of million  million and million for the years ended december   and as of december   the remaining non cash stock based compensation was scheduled to be amortized at the rate of approximately million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the actual amount of these charges to be recognized in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued compensation has been recorded are terminated before they vest 
loss from joint ventures represents an accrual for capital contribution commitments to our eratings joint venture based on its results of operations  as well as the write down of certain joint venture investments for our pro rata share of their losses incurred in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
we expect the losses to continue in future periods  at a lesser rate  as our joint ventures reinvest in their operations and strive to reach profitability 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances 
interest expense relates primarily to the interest on accrued capital contributions to our eratings joint venture 
due primarily to the anticipated continued decline in short term interest rates in as well as our planned cash use during the three month period ending march   we expect interest income to decrease in future periods 
we have recorded no provision for federal or state income taxes for any period since our inception as we have incurred losses in each period 
as of december   we had approximately  and  of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income  expiring beginning in utilization of the net operating loss tax and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
see note of notes to financial statements 
we have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our business and prospects 
we incurred net losses of million  million  million  million  and million for the years ended     and the period from july  inception through december   respectively 
during the first three quarters of  we experienced a decrease in renewal rates and the renewal rates are a significant driver for our revenue growth 
while renewal rates increased in the fourth quarter of  we cannot be certain that they will continue to rise 
we also intend to continue to invest in a disaster recovery data center  enhance our product and service offerings  and develop the infrastructure requirements necessary to grow our operations 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future

net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in arising primarily from proceeds resulting from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our initial public offering and our private placement transactions with nielsen media research 
these activities were partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations

we have a million equipment line of credit with venture lending leasing 
funds borrowed under the line of credit are secured by all of our tangible assets and bear interest at an annual rate of 
as of december  we had utilized approximately  under the line of credit with a balance of  outstanding 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
less than one year years after years in thousands capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations in the ordinary course of business we enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners principally for panel development  panel maintenance  and marketing 
there are no material commitments for these arrangements extending beyond while we have historically made additional contributions to our joint ventures in order to maintain our ownership percentage  we are not contractually required to make such contributions 
in the event of a request for capital infusion  we have the option as to whether or not we participate in the round of funding 
should we elect not to participate our equity position would be diluted in that joint venture 
we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months  although we could elect to seek additional funding prior to that time 
we could require additional capital prior to the end of this period if  for example  we were to experience greater than expected losses from operations  we were required to pay damages in connection with any litigation  or if we were to pursue one or more business acquisitions or investments 
if we do require additional financing  however  we cannot be certain that it will be available when required  on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are not successful in raising additional capital as required  our business could be harmed 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be reduced 
risk factors that may affect our performance an investment in our company involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks below  together with the other information contained in this report  before you make an investment decision with respect to our company 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and could cause you to lose all or part of your investment 
we have incurred losses since inception and we may be unable to achieve profitability we have experienced operating losses in each quarter since our inception 
we incurred net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we intend to continue to make significant expenditures related to panel maintenance and operations  restructuring and further development of our technology and infrastructure 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
although our revenue has grown as compared to prior years  we anticipate a decline in revenue during the first quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of and we may not be able to achieve significant revenue growth in the future 
our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we may not achieve sufficient revenue to become profitable 
we have a limited operating history in the evolving market for internet audience measurement we were incorporated in july and did not start generating revenue until the quarter ended june  we introduced our nielsen netratings internet audience measurement service in the quarter ended june  accordingly  we are still in the early stages of development and have only a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business 
one should evaluate our likelihood of financial and operational success in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses  delays and difficulties associated with an early stage business in an evolving market  many of which may be beyond our control  including the risk that a competing company s internet audience measurement service will become the accepted standard for internet audience measurement  the extent of growth  if any  in the internet audience measurement market  our potential inability to successfully manage any significant growth we may achieve in the future  our potential inability to develop our brand  and the risks associated with our international operations  including the necessary investments in our international joint ventures and the costs associated with winding down operations in a number of international markets 
our quarterly revenues may significantly fluctuate and because our expense levels are based in large part on our estimates of future revenues  an unexpected shortfall in revenue would significantly harm our operating results and lead to reduced prices for our stock due to our limited operating history and the evolving nature of the market in which we compete  our future revenue is difficult to forecast 
further  our expense levels are based largely on our investment plans and estimates of future revenue 
we may be unable to adjust our spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our planned expenditures in a particular quarter would harm our results of operations and could cause our stock price to fall sharply  particularly following quarters in which our operating results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
factors that may cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating results on a quarterly basis include the following  many of which are beyond our control the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business  the amount and timing of costs related to changes in the size or composition of our at home and at work panels  particularly as a result of turnover among panel members  the impact on our renewal rates caused by the failure of any of our current customers  our customers budgetary constraints  or a perceived lack of need for our services  changes in demand for our products and services due to the announcement or introduction of new products and services or the cancellation of existing products and services by us or our competitors or a continued slowdown in online advertising spending  changes in the pricing of our products and services in light of the services and pricing offered by our competitors  the impact of possible acquisitions or equity investments both on our operations and on our reported operating results due to associated accounting charges  and technical difficulties or service interruptions that significantly harm our ability to deliver our products and services on schedule 
the slowing of the general economy has had a disproportionate effect on our business our dependence on customers in e commerce and internet advertising industries has caused us to be disproportionately affected by current economic conditions 
many customers in these industries are experiencing declining revenues and are experiencing difficulty raising the capital they need to maintain their operations at prior levels 
accordingly  many such customers have scaled back the resources they devote to services such as ours and in the future they may cease operations altogether 
if economic conditions do not improve and we continue to experience a slow down in the global economy  our business and results of operation may continue to suffer greater than those businesses who operate in more traditional  established markets 
the acceptance and effectiveness of internet advertising and electronic commerce is uncertain  and if these markets fail to develop or develop more slowly than we expect  our business will suffer our future success will depend in part on an increase in the use of the internet as an advertising medium  the proliferation of e commerce and the use of the internet as part of multi channel marketing strategies 
these markets and marketing techniques are new and rapidly evolving  and the long term effectiveness of internet advertising is uncertain 
more recently  in the face of a slowing economy overall  there has been increased uncertainty about the demand and market acceptance for internet advertising and e commerce 
the adoption of internet advertising  particularly by entities that have historically relied on traditional media for advertising  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business 
these companies may find internet advertising to be less effective than traditional advertising for promoting their products and services 
they may also be unwilling to pay premium rates for advertising that is targeted at specific types of users based on demographic profiles or recent internet behavior 
the internet advertising and e commerce markets may also be adversely affected by privacy issues surrounding the targeting of this type of advertising or the use of personal information 
providers of goods and services online continue to work toward the establishment of commerce models that are cost effective and unique  and effectively deal with issues such as channel conflict and infrastructure costs 
growth in the use of the internet for e commerce may not continue  or the internet may not be adopted as a medium of commerce by a broad base of customers 
in addition  many current and potential publishers of content and commerce merchants on the internet have little or no experience in generating revenue from the sale of advertising space on their internet sites or from conducting on line commerce transactions 
because of the foregoing factors  among others  the market for internet advertising and e commerce may not continue to emerge or become sustainable 
if these markets fail to develop or develop more slowly than we expect  our business will suffer 
we have limited ability to forecast the rate at which subscriptions for our services may be renewed  and we may not achieve sufficiently high renewal rates to become profitable we derive substantially all of our revenue from annual subscriptions for our services 
as our business becomes more established  we expect subscription renewals and sales of additional products and services to existing customers to account for an increasing proportion of our revenue 
any unexpectedly low renewal rates or a reduction in the number of products and services that we are able to sell to existing customers would harm our operating results and could prevent us from becoming profitable 
to date  renewals have been an essential element of our revenue growth  however  these rates declined during the first three quarters of we can not assure you that we will be able to achieve or sustain high renewal rates  particularly during an economic downturn 
additionally  because most internet related businesses are still in the early stages of development  consolidations in our customer base or the failure of a significant number of our customers businesses could cause a decline in renewal rates for our products and services 
the market for internet audience measurement and analysis is highly competitive  and if we cannot compete effectively  our revenues will decline the market for internet audience measurement and analysis is new  rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly competitive 
we compete with a number of companies in the market for internet audience measurement services and analytical services and we expect competition in this market to intensify in the future 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are the development of independent  reliable measurement panels based on a proven high quality sampling methodology that are representative of the entire target audience  the timeliness of reported results  the breadth and depth of measurement services offered and their flexibility and ease of use  the ability to provide quality analytical services derived from internet audience measurement information  the ability to offer products and services in a comprehensive set of international markets  and pricing 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition  and significantly greater marketing resources than we have 
in addition  some of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  or devote more resources to technology and systems development 
in light of these factors  we may be unable to compete successfully in our market 
we have recently experienced significant changes in our executive management in february  william pulver replaced david toth as our chief executive officer  president and as a member of the board 
mr 
pulver had joined the company as our chief operating officer in november  formerly  mr 
pulver was president of our joint venture  eratings and was a twenty two year veteran of acnielsen 
previously  in january  we announced the departure of tim meadows  a founder of our company and our executive vice president of products and services 
also in january  we announced the appointment of four new members to our executive management team mr 
george durney  who prior to the promotion served as our vice president of sales for the eastern region  assumed the role of senior vice president for sales  ms 
barbara jarzab  formerly our vice president of research  assumed the role of vice president and chief of measurement science  mr 
sean kaldor  formerly our chief analyst and vice president of analytics  assumed the role of vice president of analytics and corporate marketing  and mr 
manish bhatia joined the company as our senior vice president for product marketing and business development 
further  in february  terry nolan resigned from his position as our vice president of administration 
we intend to continue to add new members to our senior management 
the transition of these employees into new duties and the loss of senior management may result in both disruption to our ongoing operations and the departure of existing employees and or customers 
the transitions also may materially harm the way that the market perceives our company and the price of our common stock 
failure to effectively manage this period of business transition could result in loss of sales  delays in new product developments and diversion of management resources  among other adverse effects 
any acquisitions or equity investments that we undertake could be difficult to close and integrate  may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value or harm our operating results we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
negotiating such acquisitions can be difficult  time consuming  and expensive and our ability to close such transactions may often be subject to approvals  such as governmental regulation  which are beyond our control 
consequently  we can make no assurances that such acquisitions  once undertaken and announced  will close 
for example  in october we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreements to acquire jupiter media metrix  inc and acnielsen eratings 
com but each of those agreements were subsequently mutually terminated by the parties in february and march  respectively 
further  the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into our business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of an acquired company also may consume much of our management s time and attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
companies in which we invest may not be successful in executing their business strategies and we may be required to write off all or part of our investment 
we may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions or investments successfully  or to integrate successfully any acquisitions with our current business 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could harm our business 
we are dependent on nielsen media research for the development and maintenance of panels of internet users in the united states and canada and on acnielsen and our other joint venture partners for the development and maintenance of such panels in international markets our audience measurement data is collected from randomly selected groups of internet users that are generally referred to as audience measurement panels 
our at home internet audience measurement panels in the united states and canada have been developed and are maintained by nielsen media research as part of our strategic relationship with that company 
similarly  our internet audience measurement panels and other sampling methodologies that we employ in geographic locations outside of the united states  canada  france and japan have been developed and maintained by eratings  our joint venture with acnielsen 
any failure on the part of nielsen media research  acnielsen  or our other joint venture partners to devote adequate resources to the development or maintenance of such panels or other sampling methodologies  or to maintain the overall quality of these methodologies  will harm our business 
in addition  nielsen media research may terminate its obligations with respect to internet audience measurement panels in the event it no longer holds at least of our outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis 
vnu nv  through its wholly owned subsidiaries nielsen media research and acnielsen  controls a majority of our outstanding stock and its representatives constitute a majority of our board of directors vnu  nv  through its wholly owned subsidiaries nielsen media research and acnielsen  has a majority stock ownership position in netratings  which enables it to control the direction and policies of netratings  including the election of our board of directors  amendment of our certificate of incorporation  and decisions regarding mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
this control may have the effect of discouraging certain types of transactions involving a change of control  including transactions in which the other holders of our common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
during any time that vnu is a majority stockholder  it will be required to consolidate our operating results with its own for financial reporting purposes 
our business strategy will require us to continue to incur significant losses as we attempt to establish our brand by increasing our marketing efforts and establishing strategic relationships 
incurring large expenses for these purposes may conflict with the interests of vnu in maximizing its net earnings  and vnu may therefore attempt to influence our expenditures in order to limit our losses in the short term to the detriment of our long term strategies 
in addition  vnu can control or influence the terms of our important commercial transactions  including our strategic relationships with nielsen media research and acnielsen 
we expect vnu s representatives on our board to recuse themselves from deliberations in which they have a clear conflict of interest 
however  these directors may take actions that favor vnu s interests over the interests of other stockholders 
for example nielsen media research could take actions which would increase the number of our customers for whom it is entitled to receive sales commissions  increase the amount paid to it for maintenance of audience measurement panels  decrease the sales goals that it must achieve in order to prevent us from selling advertising expenditure measurement data from third parties  or take other action detrimental to our other stockholders 
acnielsen may dramatically increase operating costs related to eratings at its discretion forcing us to incur a larger than anticipated costs related to this joint venture or choose to dilute our ownership position 
our brand is dependent on the reputations of third parties over which we have no control the strength of the nielsen netratings brand is also closely dependent on the reputations of nielsen media research  acnielsen  and our other joint venture partners and the strength of their brands 
therefore  any negative publicity generated by nielsen media research  acnielsen  or our other joint ventures whether or not directly related to any nielsen netratings branded products or services  as well as any erosion of the strength of any of their brands  will adversely affect our own brand identity 
costs to develop and maintain accurate internet audience measurement panels are significant and may increase to date  the expense of recruiting  maintaining  and operating our audience measurement panels has made up substantially all of the cost of revenue reported on our financial statements and  therefore  any increase in this expense will likely result in a corresponding decrease in our gross margin 
we believe that the quality  size and scope of our panels is critical to the success of our business 
the costs associated with maintaining the quality  size and scope are dependent on many factors some of which are beyond our control  including the cooperation rate of potential panel members and turnover among existing panel members  and accordingly we cannot control these costs to match increases or decreases in revenue 
to the extent that such additional expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue  our results of operations will be harmed 
we have limited experience in developing internet audience measurement panels  and we could experience lower cooperation rates or higher turnover rates in the future 
we may not be able to recruit or retain qualified personnel our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
we may have difficulties in retaining employees because many of our employees hold options to purchase our stock at prices significantly above the current market price for our stock 
although we provide compensation packages that include competitive salaries  stock options  bonus incentives  and other employee benefits  we may be unable to retain our key employees or to attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees in the future  which would harm our business 
we have incurred losses in our international joint ventures since their inception through our own efforts and those of our joint ventures  we have developed and currently provide data from internet audience measurement panels in countries however our joint ventures have incurred operating losses since inception 
we currently anticipate that our eratings joint venture will significantly reduce the number of countries it covers and as a result our nielsen netratings service will be available in between to countries by the end of our continued operation in international markets will require management attention  resources and significant capital contributions or dilution of our ownership position 
in addition  there can be no assurance of the continued growth of internet usage or adoption of our products and services in international markets 
the international markets for audience measurement services have historically been localized and difficult to penetrate and the expenses associated with global coverage have been significant although they have been primarily funded by our joint venture partners 
the success of our international operations will depend on our ability to recruit and maintain at home and at work panels that are representative of a geographic area  control costs and effectively manage foreign operations  and effectively develop  market  and sell new products and services in new  unfamiliar markets 
in addition  our international operations are subject to a number of inherent risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  deficiencies in the telecommunications infrastructure in some countries  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  more rigorous levels of privacy protection in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  economic and political instability  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the success of our international operations will be largely dependent on the efforts of acnielsen and our working relationship with acnielsen the challenges we face in operating internationally require skills and expertise in foreign countries that we do not currently have 
to enable us to expand and operate globally in a rapid timeframe  we entered into a joint venture with acnielsen  which controls of our eratings joint venture 
acnielsen has funded all of the venture s panel development costs in the countries initially targeted by the joint venture  which were determined by an operating committee consisting of two representatives of netratings and two representatives of the joint venture corporation 
after this initial stage  however  we will be required to either contribute additional capital to the joint venture or to allow acnielsen to make such capital contributions unilaterally with resulting dilution of our ownership interest in the venture 
accordingly  we will be subject to additional costs or dilution of our ownership interest 
furthermore  if we encounter significant problems in our working relationship with acnielsen  or if our joint venture is ineffectively managed  our international our operations are likely to fail 
we may not be successful in the development or introduction of new products and services to keep up with the proliferation of alternative internet access devices and technologies related to the expected convergence of the internet and television we believe that an increasing proportion of internet use will involve alternative internet access devices such as web enabled phones  television set top boxes and internet enabled gaming consoles and that there will eventually be a convergence of internet content and television programming 
accordingly  in order to continue to provide information about audience behavior throughout all major segments of the internet  we will be required to develop new products and services that address these evolving technologies 
we may be unsuccessful in identifying new product and service opportunities or in developing or marketing new products and services in a timely or cost effective manner 
in addition  product innovations may not achieve the market penetration or price stability necessary for profitability 
finally  we may not be successful in adapting our data collection software to evolving types of internet access devices or content 
if we are unable to provide audience measurement information regarding any significant segments of internet use  demand for our product and service offerings may suffer 
because the internet audience measurement industry is in its infancy  the pricing and acceptance of our products and services is uncertain we may be forced for competitive or technical reasons to reduce prices for some of our products or services or to offer them free of charge 
such circumstances would reduce our revenue and could harm our business 
additionally  our market is still evolving  and we have little basis to assess demand for different types of products or services or to evaluate whether our products and services will be accepted by the market 
if our products and services do not gain broad market acceptance  our business may fail 
a sale by vnu of its stake in netratings could adversely affect our stock price there are no contractual restrictions on the ability of vnu  through its nielsen media research or acnielsen subsidiaries  to sell shares of our common stock  although sales in the public market will be subject to the volume limitations of sec rule pursuant to these volume limitations  a controlling stockholder may sell shares under rule only if the shares to be sold  together with the shares sold during the past three months  do not exceed the greater of of the issuer s outstanding shares or the average weekly trading volume of the issuer s shares during the preceding four calendar weeks 
nielsen media research  acnielsen and several of our other stockholders have the right  under certain circumstances  to require us to register their stock for sale on the public market 
should vnu decide to sell its stake in netratings  it could adversely affect our stock price 
additionally  vnu will have the ability to transfer control of netratings  possibly at a premium over the then current market price 
because vnu will have the ability to effect such a transfer of control unilaterally  other stockholders could be denied an opportunity to participate in the transaction and receive a premium for their shares 
the audience measurement services offered by nielsen media research or acnielsen may eventually have features that overlap with features of our internet audience measurement services as a result of convergence of television and the internet nielsen media research s principal business consists of providing television audience measurement services based on audience panels that it develops independent of its strategic relationship with us 
acnielsen also derives a substantial portion of its revenue from television audience measurement services outside of the united states 
if television and the internet converge in the future as expected  any internet audience information that is reported by television audience measurement services through these vnu subsidiaries may overlap with the audience information that is reported by the nielsen netratings internet audience measurement services 
in the event of such overlap  vnu s services could begin competing with our services for the same research budgets among customers in the marketplace  and its offering of such services could conflict with its obligation to develop and maintain our internet audience panels 
our business may be harmed if we supply inaccurate information to our customers if we furnish inaccurate information to our customers  our brand may be harmed 
the information in our databases  like that in any database  may contain inaccuracies that our customers may not accept 
any dissatisfaction by our customers with our measurement methodologies or databases could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers and could ultimately harm our brand 
our customer contracts generally provide that each customer must indemnify us for any damages arising from the use of data  reports or analyses by the customer or the performance of any consulting  analytic or other services by us 
however  we cannot be certain that our contract provisions provide sufficient protection 
any liability that we incur or any harm to our brand that we suffer because of irregularities or inaccuracies in the data we supply to our customers could harm our business 
to date  we have not been notified of any liability claims or customer dissatisfaction relating to such problems with our data 
system failures or delays may harm our business  and our facilities and internal computer operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected losses our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
a failure of our network or our data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data  customer orders and day to day management of our business and could result in the corruption or loss of data 
our internal computer operations are located in leased facilities in san jose  california  in an area that is susceptible to earthquakes 
we do not have a backup facility to provide redundant network capacity in the event of a system failure 
accordingly  if this location experienced a system failure  our online services would become unavailable to our customers until we were able to bring an alternative facility online  a process which could take several weeks 
these systems are also vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
for example  during we experienced a significant period of downtime in the provision of our services due to the inadvertent actions of an employee  which we could not immediately correct because we lacked a back up system 
we intend to develop back up systems outside of san jose  however  as we replicate our systems at other locations  we will face a number of technical challenges  particularly with respect to database replications  which we may not be able to address successfully 
although we carry property and business interruption insurance  our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
during  the western united states and california in particular experienced repeated episodes of diminished electrical power supply 
as a result of these episodes  certain of our operations or facilities may be subject to rolling blackouts or other unscheduled interruptions of electrical power 
the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict either their occurrence  duration or cessation 
in addition  due to these power supply shortages  we may be subject to significantly greater power costs which may adversely affect our financial results 
a delay or discontinuation of our server hosting service could harm our business the servers on which we collect panel members data are maintained by abovenet at its facilities located in san jose  california 
we continually monitor our current utilization rate and the extent of our system capacity needs 
we believe we are currently operating at utilization levels that do not require additional capacity 
accordingly  our ability to collect internet audience data in real time is dependent upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of abovenet s computer and communications hardware and software systems 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at abovenet s facility could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers 
in addition  any failure by abovenet to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
in the past  we have experienced occasional minor interruptions in service from abovenet  although we have never experienced a significant interruption in service due to failures at abovenet 
in the event of a delay in the delivery of data from abovenet  or if abovenet should discontinue its services to us  we would be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services 
such a transfer could result in significant delays in our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers  which could damage our reputation and harm our business 
in recent quarters we have noticed a softening in the marketplace for co location services such as those offered by abovenet and its competitors and a corresponding decrease in the financial stability of many companies offering such services 
if this trend continues  we could face potential interruptions or cancellation of our services and could have difficulties in establishing similar services with alternative providers 
we are subject to pending legal proceedings we are currently subject to a claim filed by jupiter media metrix alleging patent infringement 
the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and enhanced damages and fees and to preliminarily and permanently enjoin us from infringing the patent in the future 
the litigation is still in the preliminary stage and although we intend to defend the matter vigorously  we are unable to predict its final outcome at this time 
this or any other claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could significantly harm our business 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could significantly harm our business 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in the event a claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology to avoid infringement  our business would be significantly harmed 
we are also currently subject to a securities class action complaint relating to our initial public offering 
the plaintiffs allege that our prospectus was materially false and misleading because it failed to disclose that the underwriters required several investors who sought large allocations of stock in the offering to pay excessive underwriters compensation in the form of increased brokerage commissions on other trades and required investors to agree to buy shares of our stock after the offering was completed at predetermined prices as a precondition to obtaining allocations in the offering 
the plaintiffs further allege that because of these purchases  our stock price after its initial public offering was artificially inflated 
similar complaints have been filed against a number of other issuers that had initial public offerings in and an adverse outcome could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights we regard our intellectual property as critical to our success 
we rely on patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights 
notwithstanding these laws  we may be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property rights or in obtaining patents or registered trademarks for which we apply 
we have applied for a us patent with respect to our bannertrack advertising tracking technology 
we have also applied to register the netratings  netratings insight  netratings online observer  bannertrack and commercetrack trademarks in the united states and have received notice of registration for netratings and netratings online observer 
we have undertaken only limited actions to protect our trademarks  servicemarks or tradenames outside of the united states and we have not registered any of our copyrights 
our patent applications or trademark registrations may not be approved or  even if approved  could be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
if our patent applications or trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own rights to the technology we are trying to patent or the trademarks we are trying to register  our use of such technology or trademark would be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with the third party owners  which might not be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we face intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve or may require us to make changes to our technology or business third parties may  from time to time  assert claims that we have infringed upon their proprietary rights or claims that our own trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid 
such claims could adversely affect our reputation and the value of our own proprietary rights 
from time to time we have been  and we expect to continue to be  subject to such claims in the ordinary course of our business  including claims of alleged infringement of patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
for example  we are subject to a patent infringement suit brought against us by jupiter media metrix 
protection of proprietary rights in internet related industries is inherently uncertain due to the rapidly evolving technological environment 
as such  there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  that provide for technologies similar to ours 
any claims of infringement and any resultant litigation  should they occur  could subject us to significant liability for damages  restrict us from using our technology or from operating our business generally  or require us to make changes to our technology 
any claims of this type  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  and divert management attention and resources 
in addition  such claims could result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims unless we are able to enter into royalty  licensing or other similar arrangements with the third parties asserting these claims 
such agreements  if required  may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to enter into these types of agreements  we may be required to either cease offering the subject product or change our technology underlying the applicable product 
if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non infringing technology or to license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis  it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any misappropriation of personal information about our panelists that is stored on our computers could harm our reputation or expose us to claims arising from damages suffered by those panelists personal information regarding our panelists is included in the data that our software captures from a panelist s internet use 
our panel data are released only in an aggregated format or in a form that is not identifiable on an individual basis 
however  if a person were to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate sensitive data about our panel members  our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by panel members as a result of such misappropriation 
governmental regulation of the internet might harm our business the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  libel and personal privacy is uncertain 
in addition  governmental authorities in various countries may seek to further regulate the internet with respect to issues such as user privacy  pornography  acceptable content  advertising  e commerce  taxation  and the pricing  characteristics and quality of products and services 
finally  the global nature of the internet could subject us to the laws of a foreign jurisdiction in an unpredictable manner 
any new legislation regulating the internet could inhibit the growth of the internet and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium  which might harm our business 
delaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make more difficult the acquisition of us by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest  or otherwise  and the removal of incumbent officers and directors 
these provisions include section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a merger with a or greater stockholder  such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer  until three years after that party became a or greater stockholder  the authorization in the certificate of incorporation of undesignated preferred stock  which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover  and provisions in our bylaws eliminating stockholders rights to call a special meeting of stockholders and requiring advance notice of any stockholder nominations of director candidates or any stockholder proposal to be presented at an annual meeting  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our board or to vote to repeal any of the anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million consisting of cash and highly liquid  short term investments 
declines of interest rates over time will reduce our interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and  accordingly  could adversely affect our net income and earnings per share 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december   our investments had a weighted average time to maturity of approximately days 
the following table presents the amounts of our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk by expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  time to maturity one year or less one to two years in thousands  except percent data unaudited cash and cash equivalents average interest rate short term investments average interest rates our outstanding capital lease obligations are all fixed interest rates and therefore have minimal exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
netratings writes down its equity investments based on its share of the net losses recorded by its joint ventures 
the net losses of those entities are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates could materially impact the joint venture losses recorded by netratings
