item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates our timely preparation of financial reports and related disclosures requires us to use estimates and assumptions that may cause actual results to be materially different from our estimated results 
specifically  we use estimates when accounting for depreciation  amortization  cost per copy contract contingencies  useful lives for intangible assets  and asset valuation allowances including those for bad debts  inventory  and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances 
our most critical accounting estimates include the following contract contingencies our office products business leases equipment usually for a sixty month period to county wide education systems and sells the lease to third party leasing companies 
under this program the school system is billed on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis at a specified rate for each copy they make 
the cost per copy charged to the school system is designed to cover the equipment cost  supplies except for paper and staples  service  and a finance charge 
on a quarterly basis  on a program by program basis  we project an expected outcome over the life of the program 
we use historical copy usage to predict the number of copies to be made over the remaining life of the program 
we adjust this estimate of the number of expected future copies based on known factors that will influence copy rates in each program 
we use historical service and supply costs incurred on each program to estimate future service and supply costs on a per copy basis 
we adjust these estimated costs for known factors that will impact service and supplies in the future 
we also estimate any other costs expected to be incurred such as deprecation on rental equipment 
on programs where the sum of the estimated future costs exceeds the expected future revenue  we recognize a provision for losses 
intangible assets we determine the utility of goodwill and trademarks based on estimated future cash flows and test for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements 
effective august  we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
our intangible assets are not impaired under this pronouncement 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast and demand requirements for the next twelve months 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
revenue recognition the government unilaterally modified the company s current boot contract to require a bill and hold procedure  on june  under bill and hold  the government issues a specific boot production order which  when completed and ready for shipment  is inspected and accepted by the quality assurance representative qar  thereby transferring ownership to the government 
under this contract modification  after inspection and acceptance by the qar  the boots become government owned property 
also  after qar inspection and acceptance  the company invoices and receives payment from the government  and warehouses and distributes the related boots against government issued requisition orders  which the company receives five days per week 
government owned boots stored in the company s warehouse are complete  including packaging and labeling 
the bill and hold procedure requires physical segregation and specific identification of government owned boots  and because they are owned by the government  the company cannot use them to fill any other customers order 
the company has certain custodial responsibilities for these boots  including loss or damage  which the company insures 
the related insurance policies specifically provide that loss payment on finished stock and sold personal property completed and awaiting delivery is based on the company s selling price 
in accordance with guidance issued under securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues from bill and hold transactions are recognized at the time of acceptance by the qar 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as leasing activity  allowances and depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal were down  to million as compared to million for fiscal the decline in sg a expenses resulted primarily from lower salary and related costs associated with reduced sales  support and administrative staff 
these reductions in sg a costs were partially offset by a increase in research and development expenditures included in sg a  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal in addition  sg a expenses were impacted by our write off of our remaining  investment in software purchased in fiscal to enhance our system sales strategy 
we considered this investment to be impaired because it is no longer used in our operations 
as a result of the above  operating loss for fiscal amounted to million as compared to the operating loss of million for fiscal the bar code business continues to be a very competitive market 
success in this business is dependent on the introduction of new market driven products in a growing economy

net revenues for the military combat boot business for fiscal increased  to million as compared to net revenues of million for fiscal this growth in net revenues was primarily the result of increased requirements for military combat boots by the us government government primarily related to the deployment of troops engaged in the war on terrorism

in september  the government instructed us to increase our production levels of military combat boots as a result of the anticipated deployment of troops in the war on terrorism 
the increased production levels represented a significant increase over the quantities normally purchased by the government under the contract 
the contract  which was set to expire on april   has been extended twice 
the first extension extended the contract ordering period through july  and provided for a minimum order of military combat boots of  pair consisting of the three current styles of direct molded sole boots covered by the contract 
these boots are scheduled for delivery during the first and second quarters of fiscal and will have an approximate million impact on revenues 
the second extension extended the contract ordering period through december  and provided for a minimum order quantity pair and a maximum order quantity of  pair 
based on orders received to date  we expect this contract extension to have a million impact on revenues 
the government has issued two solicitations to replace its expiring direct molded sole contracts  including the contract 
the first solicitation covers the three direct molded sole styles of vulcanized military combat boots 
the second solicitation covers the newly adopted waterproof membrane type of standard issue combat boot  which will replace the current molded style standard issue combat boot that has historically accounted for the majority of the government s order under the contract 
we have submitted bids for both solicitations and are awaiting the government s award decisions  which we expect to occur in november there are no assurances  however  that we will be successful in obtaining either of these contracts to produce boots for the government 
the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected if it is not successful in obtaining either of these contracts to produce boots for the government 
our contracts with the government are subject to partial or complete termination under certain specified circumstances including  but not limited to  the following for the convenience of the government  for the lack of funding  and for our actual or anticipated failure to perform our contractual obligations 
if a contract is partially or completely terminated for its convenience  the government is required to negotiate a settlement with us to cover costs already incurred 
we have never had a contract either partially or completely terminated 
however  if any such contract were either partially or completely terminated the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
net revenues for the western and work boot business increased to million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal this significant growth in net revenues was primarily attributable to high demand for our dan post and dingo branded products driven in part by the company s acquisition of the dingo and dan post brand names in june and october   respectively  a slight resurgence in the western boot market  and employment of successful sales and marketing strategies 
gross profit for the western and work boot business for fiscal grew  from million for fiscal to million for the current fiscal year

other business unit results of operations  fiscal compared to fiscal in august  we decided to phase out and discontinue the operations of the printing and packaging business 
normal operations of this unit ceased on april  net revenues amounted to approximately million and the loss from operations amounted to  net of income tax benefit 
the loss on disposal amounted to  net of income tax benefit 
the remaining assets had an estimated fair value of  financial condition and liquidity our financial condition remained strong at august  as cash and cash equivalents amounted to approximately million 
working capital equaled million and the current ratio was to we measure our liquidity by our ability to generate cash to fund our operations  investment activities and financing requirements 
our liquidity position is sensitive to and dependent on cash generated from operations  the level of capital expenditures  reductions in debt  payment of quarterly dividends  and adequate bank financing arrangements 
we have two lines of credit with a bank totaling million  all of which was available at august  one credit line totaling million expires in june the other credit line totaling million expires in november it is our belief that current cash and cash equivalents million at august   cash generated from operations  and the available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for fiscal we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
below is a table detailing  by fiscal year maturity dates  our contractual commitments as of august  amounts in thousands commitment thereafter bank loans operating leases total selected cash flow data is presented below in thousands of dollars source use of cash for years ended august  july  operating activities net earnings adjusted for depreciation and amortization accounts receivable inventories net cash provided by operating activities investing activities purchase of trademarks capital expenditures financing activities principal repayment of long term debt dividends paid net cash generated by operating activities during fiscal amounted to  in fiscal  net earnings plus depreciation and amortization totaled million  a increase as compared to fiscal as a result of our increased sales and improved operating performance 
the increase in accounts receivable balances for fiscal used approximately million of cash primarily attributable to the growth in net revenues related to our military combat boot business  western boot business and office products business 
inventory levels in the military boot business and the western boot business were increased to meet the government s requirements for military boots and to prepare for the higher demand for western boots for the fall selling season 
this increase in inventory used approximately million of cash 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we used  to purchase the dan post trademark 
this acquisition played a key role in the success of our western boot business for fiscal capital expenditures used approximately  of cash primarily for computer equipment  office equipment and manufacturing equipment for the footwear businesses 
financing activities for fiscal used  for debt principal payments and dividends 
the increase in debt reduction resulted from lower interest rates on our monthly loan payment of  and the application of proceeds from the tennessee warehouse sale to the outstanding indebtedness 
our western boot business experienced dramatic growth in fiscal our efforts to continue expanding this business in fiscal could negatively impact our liquidity 
similarly  if our military boot business s sales fall  either because we are unable to win a new contract to replace the current contract which expires in december or because the government s level of orders under a new contract is reduced  our future liquidity could be significantly adversely impacted 
inflation management does not believe inflation has had a material impact on sales or operating results for the periods covered in this discussion

important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those projected  estimated  assumed or anticipated in any such forward looking statements include the effect of competitive products and pricing  risks unique to selling goods to the government including variation in the government s requirements for our products and the government s ability to terminate its contracts with vendors  loss of key customers  acquisitions  supply interruptions  additional financing requirements  loss of key management personnel  our ability to successfully develop new products and services  and the effect of general economic conditions in our markets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes related to the aggregate million lines of credit and a term loan through our wholly owned subsidiary  dan post boot company 
as of august   there was no outstanding indebtedness under the lines of credit and million was outstanding on the term loan 
we do not buy or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
borrowings under these credit facilities described above bear interest at rates based upon the prime rate or the prime rate less a margin of one half percent offered by the applicable lender 
we have not entered into any swap agreements or engaged in any other hedging activities with respect to this variable rate indebtedness 
a increase in the interest rates under these credit facilities would increase annual interest expense by approximately  assuming that our aggregate borrowings under the credit facilities averaged million during a fiscal year
