item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains trend analyses and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements consist of  among other things  statements regarding net revenues  revenue mix  level of product returns  gross margins  costs and expenses and restructuring activity  as well as statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as we believe and similar expressions 
these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks 
as such  our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth elsewhere herein  including risk factors which may impact future operating results 
recent acquisitions in august  we acquired the remaining outstanding stock of buzzsaw 
com  inc buzzsaw that we did not own 
additionally  in october  autodesk acquired the software division of media  inc media 
the acquisition of buzzsaw is part of autodesk s strategy to extend its business to complementary new markets and the acquisition of media provides autodesk with streaming media technology for  among other things  the immediate playback of content over the internet 
both acquisitions were accounted for as purchases 
accordingly  autodesk s fiscal consolidated results include buzzsaw s and media s results of operations from the respective dates of the acquisitions 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  net revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition 
our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
based on whether the sale is product or service related  we recognize revenue as follows 
product sales are recognized at the time of shipment 
subscription  customer support and hosted service revenues are recognized ratably over the contract periods 
customer consulting and training revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for bad debts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
no single customer is significant to autodesk  and as such  our exposure to uncollectible trade receivables is generally limited 
estimated reserves are determined based upon historical loss patterns  the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with specific problem accounts 
while we believe our existing reserve for doubtful accounts is adequate and proper  additional reserves may be required should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate or as unusual circumstances arise 
product return reserves 
with the exception of contracts with certain distributors  our sales contracts do not contain specific product return privileges 
however  we permit our distributors and resellers to return product in certain instances  generally when new product releases supercede older versions 
over the past three years  product returns as a percentage of revenues have ranged from to percent annually 
the product return reserves are based on estimated channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions and other factors 
while we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns reserves is proper  any adverse activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made 
realizability of long lived assets 
we review the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable 
we consider some of the following factors important in deciding when to perform an impairment review significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget  shifts in business strategies  which impact the continued uses of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and the results of past impairment reviews 
in assessing the recoverability of these long lived assets  we first determine their fair values  which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets 
impairment charges  if any  result in situations when the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 
during fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the write off of goodwill primarily related to an acquired gis business and resulted from a strategic decision to abandon the underlying product line 
we will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
deferred tax assets 
we currently have million of deferred tax assets  mostly arising from net operating losses  reserves and timing differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software 
we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these deferred tax assets  which is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income in specific geographies 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made 
restructuring expenses associated with office closures 
during the year ended january   we recorded restructuring charges of million related to the closure of several domestic and international offices 
these charges were based upon the projected rental payments through the remaining terms of the underlying operating leases  offset by projected subleasing income 
the projected subleasing income amounts were provided by third party real estate brokers and were based on assumptions for each of the real estate markets where the leased offices were located 
should real estate markets worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as expected  we will record additional expenses in the quarterly period when such determinations are made 
this situation occurred during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded additional charges as a result of the inability to sublease offices abandoned earlier in the fiscal year 
if the real estate markets subsequently improve  and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  we will reverse some of the underlying restructuring accruals  which will result in increased net income in the period when such determinations are made 
results of operations net revenues 
our net revenues for fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal increased net revenues in asia pacific and the americas were partially offset by lower sales in europe 
net revenues for the discreet segment were million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior fiscal year as advanced system sales were significantly affected by a slowdown in the media  advertising and entertainment sectors 
should this slowdown continue  the discreet segment net revenues in fiscal will be adversely affected 
net revenues for the design solutions segment were million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the design solutions segment consists primarily of the geographic information services gis  building industry  manufacturing and platform technology divisions 
these divisions have industry specific focuses 
net revenues from sales of gis products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net revenues from sales of building industry products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net revenues from sales of platform technology products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower net revenues from sales of manufacturing products  which were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the overall increase in segment revenues was attributable to a stronger portfolio of product offerings  such as autodesk inventor  autodesk architectural desktop  autodesk map  autodesk land desktop and autocad  and increased customer demand for greater productivity tools 
although we have been reducing our dependence on autocad  sales of autocad and autocad upgrades continue to be a significant portion of our net revenues 
such sales  which are reflected in the net revenues for the platform technology division  accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal and percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal the stronger value of the us dollar  relative to international currencies  had a negative impact on net revenues in fiscal had exchange rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal  translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been million higher 
continued strength of the us dollar would have a negative impact on net revenues in fiscal international sales accounted for approximately percent of our net revenues in fiscal as compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
we believe that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total revenues 
many world economies are in the midst of current economic slowdowns 
economic weakness in any of the countries which contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our net revenues for fiscal were million  as compared to million in fiscal the percent growth reflected increased net revenues of percent in the americas and percent in asia pacific as compared to the prior fiscal year 
despite unfavorable exchange rate movements  net revenues in europe remained flat compared to the prior fiscal year 
net revenues for the discreet segment increased percent in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this was due to increased demand for our high end special effects  post production and broadcast products 
net revenues for the design solutions segment increased percent in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
net revenues from sales of gis products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net revenues from sales of building industry products increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal net revenues from sales of manufacturing products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net revenues from sales of platform technology products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these increases resulted from greater demand for our products  especially autodesk inventor and primarily all gis product offerings 
sales of autocad and autocad upgrades  which are reflected in the net revenues for the platform technology division  accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal and percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal the value of the us dollar  relative to international currencies  had a negative impact on net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal international sales  including exports from the us  accounted for approximately percent of our net revenues in fiscal as compared to percent in fiscal product returns  consisting principally of stock rotation  are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
over the past three years  product returns as a percentage of revenues have ranged from to percent annually 
we anticipate that the level of product returns in future periods will continue to be impacted by channel inventory levels  the timing of new product releases  as well as the quality and market acceptance of new products 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the cost of compact discs  cost of hardware sold mainly workstations manufactured by silicon graphics  costs associated with transferring autodesk s software to electronic media  printing of user manuals and packaging materials  shipping and handling costs  royalties  amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software  and cost of service contracts 
when expressed as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues was percent in fiscal and fiscal lower material costs  as a result of product mix  and lower software amortization costs were offset by higher royalty expenses 
cost of revenues were percent of net revenues in fiscal as compared to percent of net revenues in fiscal this lower percentage in fiscal was primarily due to reduced royalty costs of million that resulted from the expiration of some of our royalty arrangements in fiscal and reduced software amortization costs  offset in part by higher employee related expenses and professional fees 
in the future  cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues is likely to continue to be impacted by the mix of product sales  increased consulting and hosted service costs  software amortization costs  royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and the geographic distribution of sales 
however  we expect future cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues to remain within an historical range of to percent 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses include salaries  dealer and sales commissions  and travel and facility costs for our marketing  sales  dealer training and support personnel 
these expenses also include programs aimed at increasing revenues  such as advertising  trade shows and expositions  as well as various sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users 
marketing and sales expenses were percent of net revenues in fiscal compared to percent of net revenues in the prior fiscal year 
this difference was primarily due to higher employee related expenses  resulting from an increasing focus on direct sales to major accounts 
marketing and sales expenses were percent of net revenues in fiscal compared to percent of net revenues in fiscal this lower percentage in fiscal was partially due to lower employee related expenses of approximately million and some million less in advertising and promotion costs 
we expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products  to develop market opportunities and to promote our competitive position 
accordingly  we expect marketing and sales expenses to continue to be significant  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software engineers  contract development fees and depreciation of computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
general reductions in spending were partially offset by higher employee related costs  efforts associated with our location services initiatives and research and development costs incurred by redspark  prior to its dissolution in october research and development costs were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the higher expenditures in fiscal were primarily due to additional spending by acquired businesses  offset in part by lower facilities costs 
we expect that research and development spending will continue to be significant in fiscal as we continue to support product development efforts by our market groups 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include our information systems  finance  human resources  legal and other administrative operations 
general and administrative expenses were percent of net revenues in fiscal and fiscal higher employee related costs were offset by lower professional fees and depreciation costs 
general and administrative expenses were percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the lower percentage in fiscal was primarily due to lower employee related spending and lower spending related to information systems 
we currently expect that in the coming year general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  will remain generally consistent with the level experienced in fiscal amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the steady decline between years was due to some intangibles becoming fully amortized 
of the million fiscal amortization expense  million related to goodwill amortization 
beginning in fiscal  goodwill will no longer be amortized 
see recently issued accounting standards for further discussion 
restructuring and other 
during fiscal autodesk recognized million of restructuring and other charges 
these charges resulted from restructuring activities million  in process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of media million  the wind down costs associated with the dissolution of redspark million  and a goodwill write off of million 
the write off of goodwill primarily related to an acquired gis business and resulted from a strategic decision to abandon the underlying product line 
the restructuring costs  which were part of a formal exit plan approved by our board of directors during the second quarter of fiscal  were in connection with our effort to reduce operating expense levels 
during that same quarter  we reduced our revenue estimates for the remainder of fiscal as a result of the restructuring we expect to realize immediate pretax savings of million per quarter and increased cash flows of million per quarter 
these savings are expected to last for the next several quarters and the pretax savings will be reflected in each on going cost and expense line item in the consolidated statements of income 
both the pretax and cash flow savings will be re invested in other parts of the business 
we plan to record restructuring costs of approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal related to the consolidation of additional european offices 
also  we may need to record additional restructuring charges in fiscal associated with previously abandoned offices 
the reserves established during fiscal were in part based on subleasing assumptions 
should we be unable to sublease the office spaces as expected  we will record additional expenses in the quarterly period when such determinations are made 
during fiscal we reversed million of accruals  million of which related to a restructuring reserve established in fiscal the accruals were settled for less than originally estimated 
restructuring and other charges in fiscal of million consisted primarily of discreet logic inc and vision acquisition related charges and a corporate restructuring that occurred in that year 
for additional information regarding the restructuring and other charges recorded over the past three fiscal years  see note  restructuring and other in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income 
interest and other income  which consists primarily of investment income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal investment income fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances  average maturities and interest rates 
the decrease in interest and other income between fiscal  and was primarily due to a trend of declining interest rates on the investment of cash and marketable securities balances 
gain on disposal of affiliate 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a one time non cash gain of million related to the dissolution of redspark  a development stage company 
because we owned greater than percent of the voting stock  we had been consolidating redspark s operating losses since redspark was formed in april redspark s expenses  which were primarily research and development related  were included within the operating expense categories of our statement of income 
the gain  which resulted from the reversal of the minority interest liability balance  represents the reversal of cumulative losses recognized in excess of the million we originally invested 
provision for income taxes 
absent the impact of the gain on disposal of affiliate  our effective income tax rate was percent in fiscal and percent in both fiscal and there was no tax expense from the one time gain on disposal of affiliate since we had never recognized any tax benefits from our allocable share of redspark s accumulated losses 
consistent with previous years  the effective tax rate for fiscal is less than the federal statutory rate of percent due to the benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate  research credits  and tax exempt interest  partially offset by non deductible goodwill amortization 
the fiscal tax rate was lower than the fiscal and tax rates due to a relatively higher impact of these permanent items 
our future effective tax rate may be impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings  which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate  research credits  and tax exempt interest 
we believe that our fiscal effective tax rate will be less than percent primarily due to the adoption of new accounting rules that result in the discontinuation of goodwill amortization 
see recently issued accounting standards for further discussion 
at january   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately million of future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions 
we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
equity in net loss of affiliate 
in august  we acquired the remaining percent interest in buzzsaw that we did not own 
consequently  from the date of the acquisition buzzsaw s on going revenues and costs and expenses have been included in each of the respective line items in our consolidated statements of income 
we recognized equity in net losses of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing our proportionate share of buzzsaw s losses during those periods 
in april  we invested million in buzzsaw and maintained a percent interest 
loss recognition was suspended during the first quarter of  after we fully expensed all previous investments in buzzsaw 
business combinations buzzsaw in august  we acquired the remaining outstanding stock of buzzsaw that we did not own for million in cash plus the assumption of million of liabilities 
prior to the acquisition  we held a percent interest in buzzsaw  a privately held company that provides leading online collaboration applications to improve efficiencies and reduce costs for the building industry 
we accounted for this acquisition under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
the purchase consideration was allocated principally to a deferred tax asset in recognition of a significant amount of buzzsaw net operating loss and credit carryforwards that we expect to utilize to reduce our future tax obligations 
software division of media  inc media in october  we acquired the software division of media for million in cash 
we accounted for this acquisition under the provisions of sfas of the total purchase price  we allocated million to in process research and development ipr d  million to developed technology  million to brand names that have an estimated useful life of years  and million to goodwill 
the ipr d was expensed immediately since the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses could be identified 
as of the acquisition date  the ipr d substantially consisted of the hitman product  an enterprise encoding system that automates the encoding process and allows for the encoding of multiple jobs at the same time 
the hitman product was percent complete at the time  with million of estimated remaining costs to reach technological feasibility 
we recently released this product with actual costs to complete that approximated the initial million estimate 
in valuing the developed and in process technologies  we used a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected net revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses and income taxes resulting from such technologies over a year period 
the projected financial results  which were discounted using a percent rate for the developed technology and a percent rate for the ipr d  were based on expectations of media on a stand alone basis 
the revenue projections for developed technologies  which considered the release dates of new products  assumed a gradual decline 
we based the revenue projections for the ipr d on expected trends in technology and the timing of new product introductions 
vision solutions vision on april   we acquired vision  a vendor of enterprise automated mapping facilities management geographic information systems am fm gis solutions 
of the million purchase price  which was paid in cash  million represented the value of ipr d that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  and as such  was expensed during fiscal of the remaining purchase price  million was allocated to goodwill and million was allocated to other identified intangibles 
as of the acquisition date  the ipr d consisted of the development of two products  vision  which was percent complete at the time  and vision electric  which was percent complete 
both projects  which were originally expected to be completed in late fiscal  were released two years ago 
the projects were completed at an amount approximately equal to the original estimate of million 
in valuing the developed and in process technologies at the acquisition date  we used a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected net revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses and income taxes resulting from such technologies over a year period 
the projected financial results  which were discounted using a percent rate for the developed technology and a percent rate for the in process technology  were based on expectations for vision on a stand alone basis and excluded any synergistic benefits that we expected to achieve after the acquisition 
the revenue projections for the developed technologies  which considered the release dates of new products  assumed a gradual decline 
we based the revenue projections for the ipr d on expected trends in technology and the timing of our new product introductions 
although actual financial results to date have been lower than originally forecasted  autodesk has successfully integrated the vision technology with gis applications and products that were released in fiscal these gis applications and products generate sufficient cash flows to realize the remaining value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
discreet logic inc discreet in march  we acquired discreet in a business combination accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the transaction resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of approximately million shares of autodesk common stock in exchange for discreet s outstanding common stock 
accordingly  all prior period consolidated financial statements were restated to include the combined results of operations of discreet as though it had always been a part of autodesk 
prior to the acquisition  discreet s fiscal year ended on june in conforming discreet s fiscal year end to ours  we recorded a million adjustment to retained earnings during fiscal recent events revit technology corporation revit in april  we acquired revit for million in cash 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase under sfas the addition of revit complements our existing family of building industry applications with a parametric building modeler for customers to design  coordinate and integrate information about the entire building 
recently issued accounting standards during july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas this statement requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and redefines goodwill and other intangibles that should be recognized separate from goodwill 
sfas was effective for all business combinations initiated after june  both the acquisitions of buzzsaw and media were accounted for under sfas during july  the financial accounting standards board also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
this statement requires  among other things  that goodwill not be amortized  but be tested for impairment at least annually 
application of sfas is required immediately for business combinations completed after june   however  for transactions completed prior to this date  we plan to adopt the provisions of sfas on february  we recently completed an assessment of the annual goodwill impairment test pursuant to sfas and believe that none of the goodwill balances as of january  are impaired 
during august  the financial accounting standards board also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas is effective at the start of fiscal and supercedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
relating to the disposal of a segment of business 
we are currently assessing the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources at january   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and marketable securities totaling million  accounts receivable of million and a million line of credit with a financial institution 
other than operating leases  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements nor any special purpose entities 
during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities as compared to million in fiscal cash flows from operating activities  together with the proceeds from stock issuances resulting from our employee stock plans  continue to be our principal means of generating cash 
during fiscal the cash generated was used to fund the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million  the acquisition of businesses for million  capital and other expenditures of million  and dividend payments totaling million 
between november and march  the board of directors approved plans to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
of these million shares  million have been repurchased as of january  the purpose of the stock repurchase program is  among other things  to help offset the dilution to earnings per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans 
we have a us line of credit permitting short term  unsecured borrowings of up to million  which may be used from time to time for working capital or other business needs 
this credit facility contains restrictive covenants that  among other provisions  require autodesk to maintain certain financial ratios 
during fiscal and at january   we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants 
as of january   there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement  which expires in january we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments 
principal commitments at january   consisted of obligations under operating leases for facilities and some computer equipment 
at january   the future minimum lease payments under these lease commitments were as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter 
of these amounts  million has been included in our restructuring accruals at january  in april  we acquired revit technology corporation for million in cash 
the addition of revit complements our existing family of building industry applications with a parametric building modeler for customers to design  coordinate  and integrate information about an entire building 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  available line of credit and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated short term and long term cash requirements 
long term cash requirements  other than normal operating expenses  are anticipated for the development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products  financing anticipated growth  dividend payments  the share repurchase programs  the acquisition of businesses  software products  or technologies complementary to our business  and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for fiscal are currently anticipated to approximate what was incurred during fiscal  but could be reduced if our growth is less than anticipated 
our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
to minimize the impact of these fluctuations  we use foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments  primarily certain payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency instruments by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period 
the principal currencies hedged during fiscal were the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and japanese yen 
we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
risk factors which may impact future operating results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted  causing the trading price of our common stock to decline 
general economic conditions may reduce our net revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
because of the recent slowdown in the us and other countries economies  many customers are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
the impact of this slowdown on us  particularly in countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenues  is difficult to predict  but it may result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies  and increased price competition 
in addition  weakness in the end user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us  which would increase our credit risk exposure 
any of these events would likely harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include  among other things the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changes in marketing or operating expenses  changes in product pricing or product mix  platform changes  delays in product releases  distribution channel management  changes in compensation practices  the timing of large systems sales  and general economic conditions  particularly in countries where we derive a significant portion of our net revenues 
we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions 
in particular  our operating results in europe during the third quarter are usually impacted by a slow summer period  and the asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth quarters 
additionally  our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability 
further  gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of low end computer aided design products and autocad upgrades  which historically have had lower margins  grow at a faster rate than sales of our higher margin products 
existing and increased competition in the design software market may reduce our net revenues and profits 
the software industry has limited barriers to entry  and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding capacity at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry 
the design software market in particular is fairly mature and characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete  both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies 
in addition  some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources 
furthermore  the availability of third party application software is a competitive factor within the computer aided design market 
because of these and other factors  competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share  any of which would likely harm our business 
we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products  and to continue to provide existing product offerings  that compete favorably with respect to reliability  performance  ease of use  range of useful features  continuing product enhancements  reputation  price and training 
because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from a limited number of products  if these products are not successful  our net revenues will be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from sales of autocad software  autocad upgrades  and products that are interoperable with autocad 
as such  any factor adversely affecting sales of autocad and autocad upgrades  including product life cycle  market acceptance  product performance and reliability  reputation  price competition and the availability of third party applications  would likely harm our operating results 
net revenues or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline  which could harm our business 
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including the following net revenues or earnings shortfalls and changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
after periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our efforts to develop and introduce new products and service offerings expose us to risks such as costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenues 
rapid technological change as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry 
the software products we offer are complex  and despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products  damage to our reputation  loss of revenues  an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products  any of which would likely harm our business 
additionally  we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by computer aided design software 
as a result  we are transitioning to new business models  requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial resources 
such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs  or competitors may introduce new products and services that will achieve acceptance among our current customers  adversely affecting our competitive position 
disruptions with third party developer and licensing relationships could adversely impact our business 
independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities  while other technologies are licensed from third parties 
we generally either own or license the software developed by third parties 
because talented development personnel are in high demand  independent developers  including those who currently develop products for us  may not be able to provide development support to us in the future 
similarly  we may not be able to obtain and renew license agreements on favorable terms  if at all  and any failure to do so could harm our business 
our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third party developers  who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software 
some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles 
in particular markets  this disruption could negatively impact these third party developers and end users  which could harm our business 
our international operations expose us to significant regulatory  intellectual property  collections  exchange fluctuations and other risks  which could adversely impact our future net revenues 
we anticipate that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues 
risks inherent in our international operations include the following unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer collection cycles for accounts receivable  potential changes in tax laws and laws regarding the management of data  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 
our international results may also be impacted by general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets or in specific large foreign markets 
these and other factors may adversely impact our future international operations and consequently our business as a whole 
our risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency market exposures  which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 
if we do not maintain our relationship with the members of our distribution channel  our ability to generate net revenues will be adversely affected 
we sell our software products primarily to distributors and resellers 
our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network 
computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future 
in addition  the changing distribution models resulting from the internet  from increased focus on direct sales to major accounts or from two tiered distribution may impact our reseller network in the future 
while no single customer accounted for more than percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal  or  the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major international distributors or large us resellers could harm our business 
product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues 
with the exception of contracts with some distributors  our sales contracts do not contain specific product return privileges 
however  we permit our distributors and resellers to return product in certain instances  generally when new product releases supercede older versions 
we anticipate that product returns in future periods will continue to be impacted by product update cycles  new product releases and software quality 
we establish reserves for stock balancing and product rotation 
these reserves are based on estimated channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions and other factors 
while we maintain strict measures to monitor these reserves  actual product returns may differ from our reserve estimates  and such differences could harm our business 
if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights  our business could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our software products is time consuming and costly 
while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products  we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
furthermore  our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
infringement  invalidity claims  or misappropriation claims may be asserted against us  and any such assertions could harm our business 
any such claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and diversion of resources  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  which would likely harm our business 
we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies  our product and service development may be delayed 
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  and the software may not be appropriately supported  maintained or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss of licenses to  or inability to support  maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs  or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which would likely harm our business 
in addition  for certain of our on line collaboration applications and services  we rely on third party hardware and services 
financial difficulties or even failure of these third parties may impact our ability to deliver such on line collaboration applications and  as a result  may adversely impact our business 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel could harm our business 
our continued growth and success depends significantly on the continued service of highly skilled employees 
our ability to attract and retain employees is dependent on a number of factors  including our continued ability to grant stock incentive awards 
the loss of key employees or inability to recruit new employees would negatively impact our business 
in addition  we may experience increased compensation costs to attract and retain skilled personnel 
our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 
we periodically acquire or invest in businesses  software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances  debt and equity investments  and the like 
for example  in april we acquired revit 
the risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include  among others  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies  the failure to realize anticipated synergies  and the diversion of management s time and attention 
in addition  such investments and acquisitions may involve significant transaction related costs 
we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such investments and acquisitions may negatively impact our business 
in addition  such investments and acquisitions may contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the fluctuations could arise from merger related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions 
these costs or charges could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause lack of a consistent increase quarter to quarter in our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
contracts are primarily denominated in euro  swiss francs  canadian dollars  british pounds and japanese yen 
we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our hedging portfolio as of january  this analysis indicated that a hypothetical percent appreciation of the us dollar from january  would increase the fair value of our forward exchange option contracts by million 
conversely  a hypothetical percent depreciation of the dollar from january  would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange option contracts by million 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts 
interest rate sensitivity we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as security deposits  of million at january  these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of january  this sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus  plus or plus basis points over month and month time horizons 
for the month time horizon the market value changes for a   or basis point increase were reductions of million  million and million  respectively 
for the month time horizon the market value changes for a  or basis point increase were reductions of million  million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
investments in privately held businesses we have an investment portfolio with a net book value of approximately million as of january  that includes minority equity investments in several privately held technology companies  many of which are in the development stage 
we account for these minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting because our ownership interests are less than percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence on the investees 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never develop into commercially viable businesses 
we assess the value of these investments on a regular basis and when we identify other than temporary declines in the values of these investments  we write down the carrying values to their fair values 
write downs totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and in fiscal due to the inherently risky nature of these investments  we may incur additional losses in the future
