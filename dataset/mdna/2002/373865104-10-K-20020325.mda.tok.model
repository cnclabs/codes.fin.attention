in may  the company acquired the fleck insurance agency  inc of jasper  indiana 
the fleck agency was merged into the doty agency  inc the fleck agency was a general multi line  full service insurance agency with one office in jasper  indiana 
this merger was accounted for as a purchase 
accordingly  operating results of the fleck agency are included only after the date of merger 
results of operations net income in the company generated net income of  or per share 
the earnings increased by  or  from the  or per share reported for earnings during included  of after tax charges related to a balance sheet restructuring which occurred late in the fourth quarter of as described below 
operating results for represented a increase from the prior year s results  as adjusted for the effects of the balance sheet restructuring 
the increase in net income was largely fueled by increases in insurance revenues and mortgage banking revenues and a decrease in provision for loan losses 
the increase in the non interest revenue sources helped to mitigate a decline of million  or in net interest income 
late in the fourth quarter of  the company initiated a repositioning of its balance sheet within the mortgage banking component of the company s operations 
approximately million of sub prime  out of market mortgage loans were reclassified as held for sale in december the sale of these loans was completed in february  and the company no longer originates these types of loans 
net income for was  or per share as compared to net income of  or per share 
the recognition of an increased provision for loan losses for these types of loans and the difference between the book value and market value of the loans transferred to held for sale during the fourth quarter of had a significant impact on earnings for net interest income net interest income is the company s single largest source of earnings  and represents the difference between interest and fees realized on earning assets  less interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
several factors contribute to the determination of net interest income and net interest margin  including the volume and mix of earning assets  interest rates  and income taxes 
many factors affecting net interest income are subject to control by management policies and actions 
factors beyond the control of management include the general level of credit and deposit demand  federal reserve board monetary policy  and changes in tax laws 
net interest income in declined  or from results  while net interest income declined  or from net interest margin is tax equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
for the net interest margin improved modestly to compared with for this improvement in net interest margin in was attributable to an increase in core deposits and the declining interest rate environment tempered by a decline in the overall level of interest earning assets 
the net interest margin for was 
the decline in the company s net interest income during is largely attributable to a decline in the overall level of interest earning assets and an increase in federal funds sold and other short term investments 
the decline in interest earning assets is attributable primarily to the call of investment securities  refinance activity and residential real estate loans  and the aforementioned sale of sub prime mortgage loans 
the declining interest rate environment during resulted in the call of million of the company s agency securities during the majority of these securities were called during the first half of the year 
proceeds from the called investment securities and sale of sub prime residential mortgage loans were used to reduce short term wholesale funding  including time deposits of  or more  brokered deposits and fhlb advances 
in addition  a significant portion of these proceeds was held in federal funds sold and other investments for use as collateral for borrowings and to reduce other short term wholesale funds as these reached maturity during the federal funds sold and other short term investments are typically lower yielding than the earning assets that were called during average loans outstanding including loans held for sale declined million during compared with the sale of sub prime residential mortgage loans previously discussed was a significant factor in the reduced level of average loans outstanding 
also contributing to the decline in average loans outstanding during has been the sale of a majority of the company s residential loan production to the secondary market 
while these sales have not improved the company s net interest income  the increase in the level of loans sold has contributed to the company s non interest income growth 
the company s net interest margin and net interest income declined in compared with the decline in net interest margin resulted from a combination of flat loan yields and loan growth  and increased costs of wholesale funding to offset declines in core deposits 
wholesale funding represented a total of of total funding sources for compared with of funding sources for further  the mortgage banking division s use of wholesale funding sources in a rising interest rate environment reduced the division s net interest margin by approximately basis points in compared with also contributing to the increased cost of funds was the general rise in interest rates during the latter half of and first half of the company s employment of various asset growth strategies throughout also contributed to the decline in the net interest margin in compared to these asset growth strategies consisted of affiliate banks investing proceeds from fhlb borrowings in investment securities in order to more effectively utilize capital in excess of requirements 
while these strategies increased the dollar amount of net interest income  the net interest margin of the strategies range from to  and thus reduced the overall net interest margin percentage

provision for loan losses the company provides for loan losses through regular provisions to the allowance for loan losses  which totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
these provisions were made at a level deemed necessary by management to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
the lower level of provision during was primarily a result of the liquidation of the company s sub prime  out of market residential mortgage loan portfolio 
the increase in provision in was due to an increase in estimated losses related to the mortgage division s sub prime  out of market residential mortgage loan portfolio and overall loan growth throughout the company 
as discussed previously  the company sold its sub prime  out of market residential real estate portfolio in february  and the company no longer originates these types of loans 
a detailed evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is completed quarterly by management  the results of which will be used to determine provisions for loan losses 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors

a change in fee structure implemented during and a general increase in collections of fees were generally responsible for these increases 
in an effort to provide customers an opportunity to fulfill all their financial needs through the company s affiliate banks and associated financial services companies  the company completed strategic insurance acquisitions in and as a result  the company s property and casualty insurance revenues have grown steadily through the operations of doty insurance agency  inc in addition  insurance revenues have increased in both and due to the initiation during of the company s credit life and disability reinsurance operation through german american reinsurance company  ltd 
customer utilization of the company s investment product services expanded significantly during resulting in a growth in brokerage service revenue compared with the level of brokerage revenues declined by during investment brokerage services income  which is included in trust and investment product fees  totaled  in   in and  in net gains on sales of loans and related assets  and the provision for losses on loans held for sale are derived from the company s core banking and mortgage banking segments 
these gains in  exclusive of the market adjustment for sub prime loans reclassified in december  totaled  compared to  in the increased gain on sales of loans resulted from an increased level of residential loan production and a corresponding increase in loan sales to the secondary markets 
a lowering interest rate environment fueled these increases during loan sales totaled million during excluding the sub prime sale compared with during these gains losses  exclusive of the market adjustment for sub prime loans reclassified in december  remained relatively flat in at  compared to  in the provision for losses on loans held for sale on the sub prime loans reclassified in december totaled  resulting in the net loss on sales of loans  related assets  and provision for losses on loans held for sale of  during non interest expense non interest expense increased  or in following an increase of  or during the increase in resulted primarily from personnel costs 
the increase in resulted largely from increased personnel costs  merger and acquisition related expenses and collection costs primarily associated with the sub prime  out of market residential loan portfolio

the company transitioned to a pay for performance incentive plan in late and resulting in increased incentive compensation expense while salary expense has remained flat 
employee medical insurance benefit costs increased during compared with in  salaries increased approximately due to merit increases and staff additions to build necessary infrastructure in technology and support functions 
in addition  employee medical insurance benefits increased 
finally  the significant increase in investment brokerage activity and fees resulted in increased incentive compensation in in the financial services function compared to professional fees decreased during following an increase of in the level of professional fees increased during due in large part to merger and acquisition activities 
during  data processing fees increased  or 
this level of increase is due to a general rise in the number of accounts serviced by the company s third party data processor and an increase in fees associated with the electronic banking services provided to the company s customers 
data processing fees declined modestly during other operating expenses remained flat in compared with following an increase of during compared with collection costs declined  or during due primarily to the sale of the mortgage division s sub prime residential real estate loan portfolio in early the decline in collection costs was in large part offset by the building of insurance reserves by german american reinsurance company  ltd 
the increase in other operating expenses during was primarily attributable to increased collection costs associated with sub prime  out of market residential real estate loans in the company s mortgage banking division 
total collection costs increased  or during provision for income taxes the company records a provision for current income taxes payable  along with a provision for deferred taxes payable in the future 
deferred taxes arise from temporary differences  which are items recorded for financial statement purposes in a different period than for income tax returns 
the major item affecting the difference between the company s effective tax rate recorded on its financial statements and the federal statutory rate of is interest on tax exempt investments and loans 
other components affecting the company s effective tax rate include affordable housing tax credit investments and state income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was  and  respectively  in   and the lower effective tax rate in compared with the other years presented was attributable to a lower level of taxable income due primarily to the provision for losses on loans held for sale and reduced state income tax due to a change in apportionment rules 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional details relative to the company s income tax provision 
capital resources the company and affiliate banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications  including well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized  although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition 
the company and all affiliate banks at year end were categorized as well capitalized  except first state bank 
at year end  first state bank was categorized as adequately capitalized  with capital of  less than the requirement to be well capitalized 
adequately capitalized institutions must receive regulatory approval to accept brokered deposits  but management expects no other adverse consequences from first state bank s classification as adequately capitalized 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for actual and required capital ratios 
the company continues to maintain a strong capital position 
shareholders equity totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
total equity represented and  respectively  of year end total assets 
the million increase in shareholder s equity was primarily attributable to retained earnings generated by the company s affiliate banks and insurance companies 
an increase in market value of the company s securities available for sale also contributed to the increased level of shareholder s equity 
the company paid cash dividends of million in and million in the increase in dividends paid includes an increased number of shares outstanding arising from a merger transaction in late and the company s stock dividend declarations 
at december  the market value change of securities available for sale improved million  net of tax  from year end this increase in market value is recorded as an increase of shareholders equity  and was due to the decline in interest rates throughout uses of funds loans total loans at year end declined by million or

residential mortgage loans declined million or 
the company sold a majority of new residential loan production in the secondary market during the company s commercial and industrial loan portfolio increased million or

the funds were used to reinvest in tax advantaged obligations of state and political subdivisions and tax advantaged equity securities issued by us governmental agencies 
in addition  the funds were reinvested in asset mortgage backed securities to provide structured cash flows in the current historically low interest rate environment 
the level of federal funds sold and short term investments increased significantly during this increased level was primarily due to significant residential mortgage loan refinance activity driven by historically low interest rates

these sources consist of overnight federal funds purchased from other financial institutions  secured repurchase agreements that generally mature within days  and secured overnight variable rate borrowings from the fhlb 
these borrowings represent an important source of short term liquidity for the company 
long term debt is in the form of fhlb advances  which are secured by the pledge of certain investment securities and residential mortgage loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding borrowed funds 
risk management the company is exposed to various types of business risk on an on going basis 
these risks include credit risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
various procedures are employed at the company s affiliate banks to monitor and mitigate risk in their loan and investment portfolios  as well as risks associated with changes in interest rates 
following is a discussion of the company s philosophies and procedures to address these risks 
lending and loan administration primary responsibility and accountability for day to day lending activities rests with the company s affiliate banks 
loan personnel at each bank have the authority to extend credit under guidelines approved by the bank s board of directors 
executive and board loan committees active at each bank serve as vehicles for communication and for the pooling of knowledge  judgment and experience of its members 
these committees provide valuable input to lending personnel  act as an approval body  and monitor the overall quality of the banks loan portfolios 
the corporate loan committee  comprised of members of the company s executive officers and board of directors  strive to ensure a consistent application of the company s lending policies 
the company also maintains a comprehensive risk weighting and loan review program for its affiliate banks  which includes quarterly reviews of problem loans  delinquencies and charge offs 
the purpose of this program is to evaluate loan administration  credit quality  loan documentation and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable credit losses identified during its loan review process 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs less recoveries 
management estimates the required level of allowance for loan losses using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgement  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of a specific reserves on individual credits  b allocated reserves for certain loan categories and industries  and overall historical loss experience  and c unallocated reserves based on performance trends in the loan portfolios  current economic conditions  and other factors that influence the level of estimated probable losses 
the need for specific reserves are considered for credits when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring

the upward trend in net charge offs in was primarily related to sub prime  out of market residential real estate loans at the company s mortgage banking division 
the company discontinued new sub prime  out of market residential real estate lending during  and the portfolio of these loans was sold in  as discussed previously 
refer also to the section entitled provision for loan losses in the discussion regarding the results of operations 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of a non accrual loans  b loans which have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  c loans past due ninety days or more as to principal or interest  and  d other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more or when the borrower s ability to repay becomes doubtful 
uncollected interest accrued in the current year is reversed against income at the time a loan is placed on non accrual 
loans are charged off at days past due  or earlier if deemed uncollectible 
exceptions to the non accrual and charge off policies are made when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table presents an analysis of the company s non performing assets 
the decline in non accrual loans in and unfavorable trend in non accrual loans prior to was primarily attributable to sub prime  out of market residential real estate loans 
the repositioning of the balance sheet regarding these types of loans during the fourth quarter of and subsequent sale of approximately million in principal balance of loans during the first quarter of reversed the upward trend in non accrual loans

accounting standards require recognition of loan impairment if a loan s full principal or interest payments are not expected to be received 
loans considered to be impaired are reduced to the present value of expected future cash flows or to the fair value of collateral  by allocating a portion of the allowance for loan losses to such loans 
the total dollar amount of impaired loans at december  was  for additional detail on impaired loans  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and interest rate risk management liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to fund new loan demand  existing loan commitments and deposit withdrawals 
the purpose of liquidity management is to match sources of funds with anticipated customer borrowings and withdrawals and other obligations to ensure a dependable funding base  without unduly penalizing earnings 
failure to properly manage liquidity requirements can result in the need to satisfy customer withdrawals and other obligations on less than desirable terms 
the liquidity of the parent company is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
the affiliate banks source of funding is predominately core deposits  maturities of securities  repayments of loan principal and interest  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
funds management committees at the holding company and each affiliate bank monitor compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see the following section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committees and boards of directors of the holding company and its affiliate banks 
primary market risks which impact the company s operations are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the table 
lastly  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment 
the following table provides an assessment of the risk to npv in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the table indicates that as of december  the company s estimated npv might be expected to increase in the event of an increase in prevailing interest rates  and might be expected to decrease in the event of a decrease in prevailing interest rates dollars in thousands 
interest rate sensitivity as of december  net portfolio value net portfolio as a of present value value of assets changes in rates amount change npv ratio change base  the above discussion  and the portions of management s discussion and analysis that are referenced in the above discussion contains statements relating to future results of the company that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements relate to  among other things  simulation of the impact on net interest income from changes in interest rates 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied therein as a result of certain risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties expressed above  those that are described in management s discussion and analysis in item of this report  and those that are described in item of this report  business  under the caption forward looking statements  which discussions are incorporated herein by reference
