the effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the difference in the effective tax rate is primaril y attributable to a mix of foreign and domestic income and the impact of fica ti p credits on the relative pre tax income for the two years 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations include food and labor costs 
a number of the company s restauran t personnel are paid at the federal and state established minimum wage levels and accordingly  changes in such wage levels affect the company s labor costs however  since the majority of personnel are tipped employees  minimum wag e changes generally have little effect on overall labor costs 
during the firs t two quarters of fiscal  the company experienced significant increases i n utility costs  particularly natural gas 
historically  as food  labor and mos t recently  utility costs have increased  the company has been able to offse t these increases through menu price increases and economies of scale  however there may be delays in the implementation of such menu price increases or i n effecting timely economies of scale  as well as  competitive pressures which ma y limit the company s ability to recover any cost increases in its entirety 
t o date  inflation has not had a material impact on operating margins

the company may incur significan t volatility in reporting earnings in future periods as fluctuations in marke t prices of its common stock may greatly impact reported non cash compensatio n expenses on a periodic basis 
as part of its continuing review of options for enhancing stockholde r value  the company has engaged ubs warburg to advise the board of directors on a broad range of strategic alternatives for the use of the company s balance shee t and cash flow  including continued share buy backs  possible acquisitions o r other strategies including the possible sale of the company 
the company s exploration of strategic alternatives may not be successful 
to date  th e company has not adopted any alternative and is still in the process of explorin g strategic alternatives 
there can be no assurance as to which  if any alternative will ultimately be adopted  the terms and conditions of an y alternative that is selected or when any such alternative would be consummated

sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets t o be disposed of which resolve significant implementation issues that had evolve d since the issuance of sfas no 
sfas no 
also establishes a singl e accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the compan y will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal adoption of sfa s no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
risk factors if the company is unable to compete effectively with its competitors  th e company will not be able to increase revenues or generate profits 
our inabilit y to increase revenues is directly related to our ability to compete effectivel y with our competitors 
key competitive factors include o the quality and numbers of employees needed to adequately staff our restaurants  o the quality and value of the food products offered  o the quality of service  o the cost of our raw products  o the price of the food products offered  o the restaurant locations  and o the ambiance of facilities 
the company competes with other steakhouse restaurants specifically an d with all other restaurants generally 
the company competes with national an d regional chains  as well as individually owned restaurants 
the restauran t industry has few non economic barriers to entry  and as our competitors expan d operations  competition from steakhouse restaurants with concepts similar t o ours can be expected to intensify 
many of our competitors are well establishe d in the upscale and mid scale steak segments and certain competitors hav e substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than us 
suc h increased competition could adversely affect our revenues 
changing consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns  potentia l outbreaks of mad cow disease or foot mouth disease and other factor s affecting the availability of beef could force us to modify our restaurant s concept and menu and could result in a reduction in our revenues 
even if we are able to successfully compete with other restaurant companie s with similar concepts  we may be forced to make changes in one or more of ou r concepts in order to respond to changes in consumer tastes or dining patterns consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumptio n of beef  the primary item on our menus  or by specific events such as th e outbreak of mad cow disease or foot mouth disease which occurred in th e united kingdom 
in addition  these events could reduce the available supply o f beef or significantly raise the price of beef 
if we change a restauran t concept  we may lose additional customers who do not prefer the new concept an d menu  and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base t o produce the revenue needed to make the restaurant profitable 
in addition  w e may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a concept change and may not be able to successfully compet e against such competitors 
our success also depends on numerous factors affectin g discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposabl e consumer income and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these factors coul d reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of whic h could reduce revenues and operating income 
unforeseen cost increases could adversely affect our profitability 
our profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labor an d other operating costs 
our dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh foo d supplies means that shortages or interruptions in supply could materially an d adversely affect our operations 
in addition  unfavorable trends or development s concerning the following factors could adversely affect our results o inflation  food  labor and employee benefit costs  and o rent increases resulting from rent escalation provisions in ou r leases 
we may be unable to anticipate or react to changing prices 
if we ar e unable to modify our purchasing practices or quickly or readily pass o n increased costs to customers  our business could be materially affected 
failure to comply with government regulations could adversely affect ou r operating performance 
our restaurant operations are subject to certain federal  state an d local laws and government regulations  such as o obtaining of licenses for the sale of food and alcohol beverages  o national and local health sanitation laws and regulations  o national and local employment and safety laws and regulations  and o local zoning  building code and land use regulations 
while we have never experienced any significant difficulties i n obtaining necessary governmental approvals  the failure to obtain or retain foo d and liquor licenses or any other governmental approvals could have a materia l adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be subjected to dram shop liability  which generally provides a person injured by an intoxicated person with the right to recover damages fro m an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicate d person 
although we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensiv e general liability insurance  if we lost a lawsuit related to this liability  ou r business could be materially harmed 
the restaurant industry is affected by a number of trends  as well as by competition 
the restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes and b y national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
th e performance of individual restaurants may be affected by factors such as traffi c patterns  demographic considerations and the type  number and location o f competing restaurants 
in addition  factors such as inflation  increased food labor and employee benefit costs and the availability of experienced managemen t and hourly employees to successfully operate the restaurants may also adversel y affect the restaurant industry in general and our restaurants in particular 
our business depends on a limited number of key personnel  the loss of who m could adversely affect us 
some of our senior executives are important to our success because the y have been instrumental in setting the strategic direction of our company operating our business  identifying  recruiting and training key personnel identifying areas for expansion and arranging necessary financing 
these ke y personnel include jamie b 
coulter  our chief executive officer  td o connell our senior vice president of operations  and certain of our other executiv e officers 
although we believe there is a significant pool of talented personne l in the restaurant industry  if these members of our senior management tea m become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  it coul d adversely affect our business and development 
shareholders may not be able to resell their stock or may have to sell at a price substantially lower than the price they paid for it 
the trading price for our common stock has been highly volatile and coul d continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations i n our quarterly operating results  general conditions in the restaurant industr y or the general economy  and other factors 
in addition  the stock market i s subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the market price for publi c companies generally  or within broad industry groups  which fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating results or othe r circumstances of a particular company 
such fluctuations may adversely affec t the liquidity of our common stock  as well as price that holders may achieve fo r their shares upon any future sale 
finally  since we announced that we ha d engaged ubs warburg to explore strategic alternative for us  the trading pric e of our common stock has increased 
while we are unable to determine whether suc h announcement has had any impact on the price of our stock  if such announcemen t has had a positive impact on our stock price and if we are unable to consummat e a transaction which might enhance stockholder value or corresponds to th e expectations of investors  the price of our common stock could be adversel y impacted 
staggered board  blank check preferred stock  change of control agreements 
our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for thre e classes of directors to be elected on a staggered basis 
this enables existin g directors to exercise significant control over our affairs  and may act as a n impediment to any future attempts by third parties to take control of our boar d of directors 
the company plans to ask stockholders to approve a charte r amendment at its annual meeting to eliminate the present staggered term s and have directors elected annually starting with its annual meeting 
i n addition  our board of directors has the authority without further action by th e stockholders to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fi x the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof 
the exercise o f this authority may act as a further impediment to any future attempts by thir d parties to take control of our board of directors 
finally  our executive officers and certain employees are entitled t o receive a lump sum equal to one year s annual compensation plus othe r payments and incidental benefits under certain circumstances if there has been a change of control of the company 
mr 
coulter s change of control agreement is a single trigger contract in that he will receive the benefits provided for i n the agreement if there is a change of control as defined in the contract whil e the change of control contract for the other executive officers and employees i s a double trigger agreement in that there must be a change of control and a second event to occur within days of the change of control 
a single vendor distributes most of our consumable products 
approximately of the consumable products used in our restaurant s are distributed through and delivered by a single vendor 
while we believe w e could replace this vendor  any disruption of services by this vendor or an y change to a new vendor could adversely affect our restaurants 
we are uncertain as to the future of our australian operations 
the sales and operating margins of our australian restaurants hav e been negatively impacted by the effects of the national general sales ta x implemented by the australian government in july and the weakening of th e overall australian economy has had a negative impact on restaurant sales i n australia 
we closed australian restaurants in  one in  an d additional units may need to be closed in the future  due to  among othe r things  the failure of the market trade area surrounding various locations t o develop as originally anticipated  thus  such market areas may not achiev e sufficient demographics to support a profitable level of business 
we als o incurred a pre tax charge for impaired assets in each of fiscal and fisca l for the write down of impaired assets at certain under performin g australian restaurants 
these write downs require the use of estimates an d projections which are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
i f consumer spending in restaurants continues to be negatively impacted  we may b e required to make additional write downs of impaired assets in australia 
we had non cash stock compensation expenses for fiscal year of  and our future reported earnings will be impacted by previous stock repricings 
we currently have options outstanding to purchase approximatel y  shares subject to variable plan accounting 
until such options ar e exercised  forfeited or expire unexercised  as long as the price of our commo n stock continues to close above at the end of subsequent fiscal quarters we will record an additional non cash expense or benefit related to the reprice d options then outstanding based upon the change in our common stock price a s compared to the price at the beginning of the last reporting period 
this coul d result in extreme volatility in reported earnings which could increas e volatility in our stock price 
for fiscal year we had a non cas h compensation expense of  and our stock price at the end of fisca l was 
our exploration of strategic alternatives may not be successful we engaged ubs warburg to advise us in exploring a broad range o f strategic alternatives for enhancing the company s stockholder value 
we ar e uncertain as to what strategic alternatives may be available to us or wha t impact any particular strategic alternative will have on our stock price i f accomplished 
uncertainties and risks relating to our exploration of strategi c alternatives include o the exploration of strategic alternatives may disrup t operations  affect morale and distract management  which coul d have a material adverse effect on our operating results  o the process of exploring strategic alternatives may be mor e time consuming and expensive than we currently anticipate  o we may not be able to successfully achieve the benefits of th e strategic alternative recommended to us by our financia l advisor and our board  and o perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of ou r company may result in the loss of employees or busines s partners 
the impact of the recent terrorist attacks and the risk of future terroris t attacks may adversely impact our revenue 
as a result of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september  a number of our restaurants  particularly our del frisco s and sullivan s restaurants  were negatively affected 
additionally  recent terrorist warnings both in the united states and internationally  suggest the possibility of futur e terrorist attacks  which together with the unpredictability of future militar y action and other responses to such terrorist attacks has resulted in economi c uncertainty 
the occurrence of future terrorist attacks may adversely affect ou r business and make it more difficult to forecast our future results of operation item a
