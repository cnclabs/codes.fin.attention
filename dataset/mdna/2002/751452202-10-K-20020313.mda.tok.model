overview we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate investment trust that develops  acquires  manages and owns community centers in the midwestern  southeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
as of december   we had a portfolio of shopping centers totaling approximately million square feet of gross leaseable area located in states 
our properties consist of community shopping centers  nine of which are power centers and three of which are single tenant facilities 
we also own one enclosed regional mall 
our operating results are dependent primarily upon rental income received from tenants under existing leases 
our future success is dependent in part on our ability to collect rental payments  maintain occupancy and increase rental rates as leases expire 
an economic slowdown could result in increases in our overall vacancy rates or declines in the rent we can charge to re lease properties upon expiration of current leases 
occupancy occupancy in increased for our overall portfolio with a breakdown by asset category as follows enclosed regional mall community centers portfolio summary average base rents average base rents  per square foot  for the two portfolio categories at december  and were as follows percentage increase enclosed regional mall community centers portfolio summary lease renewals we achieved the following in base rent for leases that were renewed during per square per square percentage foot rent foot rent increase prior lease new lease decrease gla enclosed regional mall community centers new leases for new leases entered into during  we achieved the following increases in base rent per square foot rent per square percentage portfolio foot rent increase average new lease decrease gla anchor non anchor 
table of contents per square foot rent per square percentage portfolio foot rent increase average new lease decrease gla enclosed regional mall community centers critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
it is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
consistent with our disclosure policies we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgment reserve for bad debts we provide for bad debt expense based upon the reserve method of accounting 
historically we have provided approximately of rental revenues as our annual bad debt reserve based on the level of bad debt we have experienced 
due to the economic downturn in the retail industry and the increase in the number of retail companies filing for bankruptcy protection including kmart corporation during january  we increased the bad debt expense to approximately of rental revenue for the year ended december  we continuously monitor the collectability of our accounts receivable billed  unbilled and straight line from tenants and based on our judgment  adjust the allowance for bad debts as necessary 
it is our policy to cease recording rental income from tenants when we believe such amounts would be uncollectible 
management believes the allowance is adequate to absorb currently estimated bad debts 
however  if we experience bad debts in excess of the reserves we have established  our operating income would be reduced 
bad debt expense amounted to  and for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue recognition shopping center space is generally leased to retail tenants under leases which are accounted for as operating leases 
we recognize minimum rents on the straight line method over the terms of the leases  as required under statement of financial accounting standard no 
certain of the leases also provide for additional revenue based on contingent percentage income which is recorded on an accrual basis once the specified target that triggers this type of income is achieved 
the leases also typically provide for tenant recoveries of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
these recoveries are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
straight line rental income was greater than the current amount required to be paid by our tenants by   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounts receivable include unbilled straight line rent receivables of  at december  and  at december  straight line rent receivable at december   includes approximately  due from kmart corporation 
real estate we record real estate assets at the lower of cost or fair value if impaired 
costs incurred for the acquisition development and construction of properties are capitalized 
for redevelopment of an existing operating property  the undepreciated net book value plus the cost for the construction including demolition costs incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent such costs do not exceed the estimated fair value when complete 
to the extent such costs exceed the estimated fair value of such property  the excess is charged to expense 
we evaluate the recoverability of our investment in real estate whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired 
our assessment of recoverability of our real estate assets includes  but is not limited to recent operating results  expected net operating cash flow 
table of contents and our plans for future operations 
for the years ended  december   and  none of our assets were considered impaired 
during  we have completed redevelopment projects aggregating approximately  square feet at a total cost of approximately  at three of our shopping centers conyers crossing  clinton valley mall and roseville plaza 
we are currently expanding or redeveloping two shopping centers sunshine plaza and lantana plaza for a total cost of approximately in we will begin the redevelopment of our tel twelve shopping center from an enclosed regional mall to an open air center for a total cost of approximately  in connection with the redevelopment  we will demolish approximately of the gross leasable area  square feet of the shopping center and construct a  square foot building for a nationally recognized home improvement retailer 
other assets other assets consist primarily of prepaid expenses  proposed development and acquisition costs  and financing and leasing costs which are amortized using the straight line method over the terms of the respective agreements 
proposed development and acquisition costs amounted to  at december  and  at december   and included our investment of  in an entity that is currently developing a shopping center 
the cost method is used to account for our investment in the entity because we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee s operating and financial policies 
using our best estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  we review for impairment such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable 
result of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenue increased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  of the  increase  was the result of increased minimum rents 
the sale of white lake marketplace and athens town center in resulted in a reduction of  in minimum rents offset by a  increase in minimum rents in our portfolio when compared to the year ended december  recoveries from tenants decreased  or to  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the overall recovery ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decline in this ratio is a result of decreased occupancy during redevelopment of four shopping centers and the sale of white lake marketplace and athens town center 
in january  we sold white lake marketplace to pontiac mall limited partnership for cash of  resulting in a gain on sale of approximately  various executive officers trustees of the company are partners in that partnership 
the property was offered for sale  utilizing the services of a national real estate brokerage firm  and we accepted the highest offer from an unrelated party 
subsequently the buyer cancelled the agreement 
pontiac mall limited partnership presented a comparable offer  which resulted in more favorable economic benefits to us 
the sale of the property was entered into upon the unanimous approval of the independent members of our board of trustees 
since january   ramco gershenson  inc ramco  our management company providing property management services to us and to other entities  has been consolidated in our financial statements 
as of january   ramco elected to be a taxable real estate investment trust subsidiary for federal income tax purposes 
in conjunction with the tax election  we entered into an option agreement to purchase the remaining voting common stock of ramco 
in prior years this entity was accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
fees and management income earned by ramco contributed  to the increase in revenue for the year ended december  
table of contents for the twelve months ended december   percentage rents decreased to  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease is the result of tenant changes associated with redevelopment projects and our efforts to convert percentage rent to higher minimum rent when renewing leases 
interest and other income increased  to  for the twelve months ended december  total expenses for the year ended december  increased  or  to  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to a  increase in depreciation and amortization  a  increase in general and administrative expenses  and a increase in other operating expenses 
the increase was offset by a decrease in total recoverable expenses  including real estate taxes and a  decrease in interest expense 
depreciation and amortization increased in  to  from  in the increase is primarily due to the redevelopment projects completed during and amortization of leasing commissions and financing costs 
the consolidation of ramco in contributed to the increase

capitalized interest amounted to  during the twelve months ended december   and related to construction of auburn mile and redevelopment projects  as compared to of capitalized interest for redevelopment projects for the same period in for the year ended december   weighted average interest rates decreased to compared to for the same period in earnings from unconsolidated entities increased from in to for the year ended december  our share of rossford development llc s income increased from in to in the two joint ventures we invested in during contributed to the increase 
in addition  depreciation and amortization expense arising from our net basis in the unconsolidated entities assets decreased by from in to for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we completed  in asset sales and recognized net gains of  the sales of properties included white lake marketplace and athens town center  as well as the sales of four parcels of land 
the increase in minority interest is the result of higher income before minority interest for the twelve months ended december  when compared to the twelve months ended december  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenue increased or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  of this increase  minimum rents increased by  or  to  in from  in recoveries from tenants increased  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the sale of chester springs and rivertowne square in august to rpt invest  llc and the disposition of commack toys r us and trinity corners shopping center in december accounted for a reduction in minimum rent of  for the year ended december  development projects at white lake marketplace and auburn mile contributed  to minimum rent when compared to the balance of the increase in minimum rents is primarily attributable to five redevelopment projects completed during 
table of contents recoveries from tenants increased  or and is primarily due to a higher level of recoverable operating expenses and real estate taxes associated with white lake marketplace and auburn mile developments 
the overall recovery ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  for the twelve months ended december   percentage rents decreased to  compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of our initiative to convert tenants to higher minimum rent  reducing our reliance on percentage rents as a potential source of revenue 
interest and other income increased  from for the twelve months ended december  to  lease termination fees were  greater in the twelve months ended december  when compared to the same period in and kiosk license income increased for the period 
gain on sale of land options during the twelve months ended december   accounted for of the increase

real estate taxes increased  or  from  to  for the year ended december  white lake marketplace and auburn mile development projects contributed  to the increase in real estate taxes when compared to the  increase in depreciation is primarily due to the redevelopment projects we completed during and amortization for current year additions of tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
depreciation and amortization for white lake marketplace contributed to the increase 
general and administrative expenses were  and represented of total revenue for the year ended december   compared to  and of total revenue for the same period in the decrease is primarily attributable to a gain on sale of real estate recognized by ramco  one of our unconsolidated entities in  and by increased leasing and development fees earned by the unconsolidated entity  which reduced our reimbursement obligation 
interest expense increased  from  to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase is the result of higher interest rates on variable rate debt for the twelve months ended december   increased borrowings on the credit facility and increased borrowings on the construction loans used to finance white lake marketplace and the auburn mile developments 
earnings from unconsolidated entities increased  to in from a loss of in improved operating results of the unconsolidated entities increased  from in to for the year ended december  in addition  depreciation and amortization expense arising from our net basis in the unconsolidated entities assets decreased by for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we completed  in asset sales and recognized net gains of  the sales of properties included land parcels at tel twelve mall in april and roseville plaza in december the increase in minority interest is primarily the result of higher income before minority interest for the twelve months ended december  when compared to the twelve months ended december  liquidity and capital resources we generated  in cash flows from operating activities and  from investing activities for the year ended december  redevelopment of four shopping centers and improvements to existing properties used  and additional investments in unconsolidated entities used  during the year ended december  proceeds from the sale of real estate provided  during the year

the debt consists of twelve loans secured by various properties  plus one unsecured term loan and the credit facility  as described below 
ten of the mortgage loans amounting to  have maturities ranging from to  monthly payments which include regularly scheduled amortization  and have fixed interest rates ranging between to 
one of the mortgage loans  evidenced by tax free bonds  amounting to  secured by oak brook square shopping center  matures in  and carries a floating interest rate equal to of the new issue long term capital a rated utility bonds  plus interest to the lender sufficient to cause the lender s overall yield on its investment in the bonds to be equal to basis points over their applicable libor rate at december  
in april  we executed a  mortgage loan with lasalle bank na  secured by the property at madison shopping center 
the loan has a fixed interest rate of and matures in may in november  we converted a construction loan to finance the auburn mile shopping center development located in auburn hills  michigan to a new  mortgage loan 
the loan carries an interest rate of basis points over libor  an effective rate of at december   and matures in september the credit facility bears interest between and basis points over libor depending on certain debt ratios effective interest rate of at december  and matures september the credit facility is secured by mortgages on various properties and contains financial covenants relating to liabilities to assets ratios  minimum operating coverage ratios and a minimum equity value 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenant terms 
outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility amounted to at december  under terms of the credit facility  we are required to maintain interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rate on our floating rate debt 
we have interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of  at december  based on rates in effect at december   the agreements provide for fixed rates ranging from to and expire at various dates through march we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counter party to the interest rate swap agreements  however we do not anticipate non performance by the counter party 
after taking into account the impact of converting our variable rate debt into fixed rate debt by use of the interest rate swap agreements  at december   our variable rate debt accounted for approximately  of outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
variable rate debt accounted for approximately of our total debt and of our total capitalization 
our debt to total market capitalization our debt plus the market value of our equity ratio was at december  the properties in which ramco gershenson properties  lp the operating partnership  owns an interest and which we account for using the equity method of accounting are subject to non recourse mortgage indebtedness 
at december   the pro rata share of non recourse mortgage debt of these properties held by unconsolidated entities was  with a weighted average interest rate of 

table of contents the mortgage loans other than our credit facility encumbering our properties  including properties held by our unconsolidated joint ventures  are generally non recourse  subject to certain exceptions for which we would be liable for any resulting losses incurred by the lender 
these exceptions vary from loan to loan but generally include fraud or a material misrepresentation  misstatement or omission by the borrower  intentional or grossly negligent conduct by the borrower that harms the property or results in a loss to the lender  filing of a bankruptcy petition by the borrower  either directly or indirectly  and certain environmental liabilities 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain of such events  such as fraud or filing of a bankruptcy petition by the borrower  we would be liable for the entire outstanding balance of the loan  all interest accrued thereon and certain other costs  penalties and expenses 
with respect to the crossroads centre shopping center  which is owned by a joint venture in which we have a interest  we have guaranteed to the joint venture the completion of the center by october   and we have entered into a master lease with the joint venture under which we are obligated to provide net operating income sufficient to provide a to debt service coverage ratio 
in the event that the center is not completed by the scheduled completion date  we would be obligated to the joint venture for any damages it incurs due to such failure 
we believe that the construction of the center has been substantially completed in accordance with the terms of our agreement 
we have the option to purchase the crossroads centre shopping center from the joint venture  exercisable by notice on or before july   and if we do not exercise this option  we will be obligated to make an option payment of million to the owner of this joint venture on july  our capital structure at december   includes property specific mortgages  an unsecured term loan  the credit facility  our series a preferred shares  our common shares and a minority interest in the operating partnership 
at december   the minority interest in the operating partnership represented a ownership in the operating partnership which may  under certain conditions  be exchanged for  common shares 
as of december   operating partnership units op units issued were exchangeable for our common shares on a one for one basis 
we  as sole general partner of the operating partnership  have the option  but not the obligation  to settle exchanged op units in cash based on the current trading price of our common shares 
assuming the exchange of all limited partnership interests in the operating partnership  there would have been  of our common shares outstanding at december   with a market value of approximately  at december  based on the closing price of per share on december  
the principal uses of our liquidity and capital resources are for acquisitions  development  redevelopment  including expansion and renovation programs and debt repayment 
to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  we are required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our real estate investment trust taxable income as defined in the code 
we have historically funded  and may continue to fund  some of our acquisition and development activities by entering into joint venture transactions with third parties in which we own or less of the joint venture entity 
as part of our business plan to improve our capital structure and reduce debt  we will continue to pursue the strategy of selling fully valued properties and to dispose of shopping centers that no longer meet the criteria established for our portfolio 
our ability to obtain acceptable selling prices and satisfactory terms will impact the timing of future sales 
net proceeds from the sale of properties are expected to reduce outstanding debt 
the conversion of our tel twelve shopping center from an enclosed regional mall to an open air center is currently in process along with the proposed redevelopment at our shoppes of lakeland 
these redevelopments will include demolition and rebuilding of a portion of tel twelve  as well as retenanting of the shoppes of lakeland 
as a result of reduced rental income during the redevelopment period  it is our estimate that net income will decrease by approximately  for these two centers for the year ended december  
table of contents we anticipate that the combination of the availability under the credit facility  possible equity offerings  the sale of existing properties  and potential new debt will satisfy our expected working capital requirements through at least the next months 
we anticipate adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future to fund future developments  expansions  repositionings  and to continue currently planned capital programs  and to make distributions to our shareholders in accordance with the code s requirements applicable to reits 
although we believe that the combination of factors discussed above will provide sufficient liquidity  no such assurance can be given 
economic conditions substantially all of the leases at our properties provide for tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance and real estate taxes  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
many of the tenants leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact of inflation 
such provisions include the ability to receive percentage rentals based on a tenant s gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years  which may enable the operating partnership to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base and or percentage rentals if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
the retail industry has experienced some financial difficulties during the past few years and certain local  regional and national retailers have filed for protection under bankruptcy laws 
if this trend should continue  our future earnings performance could be negatively impacted 
risks related to our business adverse market conditions and tenant bankruptcies the economic performance and value of our real estate assets are subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate  including risks related to adverse changes in national  regional and local economic and market conditions 
our current properties are located in states in the midwestern  southeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
the economic condition of each of our markets may be dependent on one or more industries 
an economic downturn in one of these industries may result in a business downturn for our tenants  and as a result  these tenants may fail to make rental payments  decline to extend leases upon expiration  delay lease commencements or declare bankruptcy 
any tenant bankruptcies  leasing delays  or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant s lease  causing material losses to us and adversely impacting our operating results 
if our properties do not generate sufficient income to meet our operating expenses  including future debt service  our income and results of operations would be adversely affected 
during  seven of our tenants filed for bankruptcy protection  representing a total of locations 
these tenants represented approximately of our annualized base rental income at december  during january  two more of our tenants filed for bankruptcy protection  including kmart corporation  which represented approximately of our annualized base rental income at december  any bankruptcy filings by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre bankruptcy debts from that tenant  the lease guarantor or their property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums 
if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy  all pre bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full 
however  if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims 
it is possible that we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold  if at all  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents several of our tenants represent a significant portion of our leasing revenues 
as of december   we received of our annualized rent from wal mart stores  inc and from kmart corporation 
five other tenants each represented at least of our total annualized base rent 
the concentration in our leasing revenue from a small number of tenants creates the risk that  should these tenants experience financial difficulties  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we are involved in various tax disputes with the internal revenue service and may not be able to resolve these disputes on satisfactory terms 
we are involved in a dispute with the irs that relates to its examination of our taxable years ended december   through during the third quarter of  we held more than of the value of our total assets in short term treasury bill reverse repurchase agreements  which could be viewed as non qualifying assets for purposes of determining whether we qualify to be taxed as a reit 
we requested that the irs enter into a closing agreement with us that our ownership of the short term treasury bill reverse repurchase agreements would not adversely affect our status as a reit 
the irs deferred any action relating to this issue pending the further examination of our taxable years ended december   through as discussed below  the field examination has since been completed and the irs has proposed to disqualify us as a reit for our taxable year ended december   based on our ownership of the short term treasury bill reverse repurchase agreements 
in connection with the incorporation and distribution of all of the shares of atlantic realty trust in may  we entered into a tax agreement with atlantic under which atlantic assumed all tax liability arising out of the irs then ongoing examination  excluding any tax liability relating to any actions or events occurring  or any tax return position taken  after may   but including liabilities for interest  penalties  additions to tax and costs relating to covered taxes 
in addition  the tax agreement provides that  to the extent any of our taxes which atlantic is obligated to pay under the tax agreement can be avoided through the declaration of a deficiency dividend that is  our declaration and payment of a distribution that is permitted to relate back to the year for which the irs determines a deficiency in order to satisfy the requirement for reit qualification that we distribute a certain minimum percentage of our reit taxable income for such year  we will make  and atlantic will reimburse us for the amount of  such deficiency dividend 
in addition to examining our taxable years ended december   through  the irs examined our taxable year ended december  based on these examinations  the irs has not only proposed to disqualify us as a reit for our taxable year ended december   based on our ownership of the short term treasury bill reverse repurchase agreements  as noted above  but has also proposed to adjust increase our reit taxable income for the taxable years ended december     and if sustained  the adjustments proposed by the irs to our reit taxable income would  in and of themselves  disqualify us as a reit for at least some of these years unless we were to pay a deficiency dividend for each of the taxable years for which we would otherwise be disqualified as a reit as a result of having failed to distribute a sufficient amount of our taxable income 
we are continuing to dispute these issues with the irs through an administrative appeals procedure 
in addition  the irs is currently conducting an examination of our taxable years ended december   and  and of our operating partnership for the taxable years ended december   and based on the second of two examination reports issued by the irs  we could be liable for up to million in combined taxes  penalties and interest through march  however  this examination report acknowledges as does the initial examination report that we can avoid disqualification as a reit for certain of our examined tax years if we distribute a deficiency dividend to our shareholders 
the distribution of a deficiency dividend would be deductible by us  thereby reducing our liability for federal income tax 
based on the second examination report  the proposed adjustments to our reit taxable income would require us to pay a deficiency dividend to our current shareholders resulting in combined taxes  penalties  interest and deficiency dividends of approximately million as of march  if the irs successfully challenges our status as a reit for any taxable year  we will be able to re elect reit status commencing with the fifth succeeding taxable year or possibly an earlier taxable year if we meet 
table of contents certain relief provisions of the internal revenue code 
thus  for example  if the irs successfully challenges our status as a reit solely for our taxable year ended december   based on our ownership of the short term treasury bill reverse repurchase agreements  we will be able to re elect reit status no later than our taxable year which began january  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements made part of atlantic s quarterly report on form q filed with the securities and exchange commission for the quarter ended september   atlantic has disclosed its liability for the tax deficiencies and interest and penalties on the tax deficiencies proposed to be assessed against us by the irs for the taxable years ended december   through  as reflected in each of the two examination reports issued by the irs 
we believe  but can provide no assurance  that atlantic currently has sufficient assets to pay such tax deficiencies  interest and penalties 
according to the quarterly report on form q filed by atlantic for its quarter ended september   atlantic had net assets on september   of approximately million as determined pursuant to the liquidation basis of accounting 
if the amount of tax  interest and penalties assessed against us ultimately exceeds the amounts proposed in each of the examination reports  however  because interest continues to accrue on the proposed tax deficiencies  or if additional tax deficiencies are proposed or for any other reason  then atlantic may not have sufficient assets to reimburse us for all amounts we must pay to the irs  and we would be required to pay the difference out of our own funds 
accordingly  the ultimate resolution of any controversy over tax liabilities covered by the above described tax agreement may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows  including if we are required to distribute deficiency dividends to our shareholders and or pay additional taxes  interest and penalties to the irs in amounts that exceed the value of atlantic s net assets 
moreover  the irs may assess us with taxes that atlantic is not required under the above described tax agreement to pay  such as taxes arising from the recently commenced examination of us for the taxable years ended december   and  and of our operating partnership for the taxable years ended december   and there can be no assurance  therefore  that the irs will not assess us with substantial taxes  interest and penalties which atlantic cannot  is not required to  or otherwise does not pay 
our failure to qualify as a reit would result in higher taxes and reduced cash available for our shareholders 
we believe that we currently operate in a manner so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
if  however  we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates  and distributions to shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income 
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders  which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of  and trading prices for  our shares 
unless entitled to relief under certain internal revenue code provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit 
ability to successfully identify or complete suitable acquisitions and new developments 
integral to our business strategy is our ability to continue to acquire and develop properties 
we also may not be successful in identifying suitable real estate properties that meet our acquisition criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms 
we may not be successful in identifying suitable areas for new development  negotiating for the acquisition of the land  obtaining required permits and authorizations  completing developments in accordance with our budgets and on a timely basis or leasing any newly developed space 
if we fail to identify or complete suitable acquisitions or developments within our budget  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our growth could slow  which in turn could adversely impact our share price 

table of contents our redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
a key component of our business strategy is exploring redevelopment opportunities at existing properties within our portfolio and in connection with property acquisitions 
to the extent that we engage in these redevelopment activities  they will be subject to the risks normally associated with these projects  including  among others  cost overruns and timing delays as a result of the lack of availability of materials and labor  weather conditions and other factors outside of our control 
any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these redevelopment projects and adversely impact our operating results 
sensitivity analysis we are exposured to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt obligations 
based on our debt and interest rates and the interest rate swap agreements in effect at december   a basis point change in interest rates would affect our earnings and cash flows by approximately funds from operations we generally consider funds from operations  also known as ffo  an appropriate supplemental measure of our financial performance because it is predicated on cash flow analyses 
we have adopted the most recent national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo  which was amended effective january  under the nareit definition  ffo represents income before minority interest  excluding extraordinary items  as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  gains on sales of depreciable property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
our computation of ffo may  however  differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other real estate companies  and therefore  may not be comparable to these other real estate companies 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to pay distributions
