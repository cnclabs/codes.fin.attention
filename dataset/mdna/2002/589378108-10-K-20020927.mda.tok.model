such risks and uncertainties include certain factors identified in the following discussion as well as the risk factors appearing in item in this report on form k 
overview mercury designs  manufactures and markets high performance  real time digital signal and image processing computer systems that transform sensor generated data into information which can be displayed as images for human interpretation or subjected to additional computer analysis 
these multicomputer systems are heterogeneous and scalable  allowing them to accommodate several microprocessor types and to scale from a few to hundreds of microprocessors within a single system 
during the past several years  the majority of the company s revenue has been generated from sales of its products to the defense electronics market  generally for use in intelligence gathering electronic warfare systems 
the company s activities in this area have focused on the proof of concept  development and deployment of advanced military applications in radar  sonar and airborne surveillance 
medical imaging is another primary market currently served by the company 
mercury s computer systems are embedded in magnetic resonance imaging mri  computed tomography ct  positron emission tomography pet  and digital cardiology imaging machines 
the remaining revenues are derived from computer systems used in such commercial oem solutions as semiconductor photomask generation  wafer inspection  baggage scanning  seismic analysis and development of new reticle inspection and wafer inspection systems 
mercury uses a direct sales force to sell its computer systems to the defense electronics markets in the us  japan  the united kingdom and france 
defense electronics sales in other countries are achieved through distributors 
the company also uses a direct sales force to sell its computer systems to the us and international medical imaging markets 
the company sells its products to oems  value added resellers and end users 
over the past three fiscal years  the company has expanded its sales force to support growing revenues  made significant expenditures to recruit additional technical and professional staff  invested in information technology  and improved the company s financial  administrative and management infrastructure 
revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
for products with acceptance criteria that are not successfully demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance 
the company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
for long term contracts to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex equipment  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
revisions in contract cost estimates have the effect of adjusting earnings applicable to performance in prior periods in the current period 
anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which determined 
service revenue is recognized ratably over applicable contract periods or as the services are performed 
cost of revenues includes the cost of materials  component assembly  internal labor and related overhead 
cost of revenues also may include engineering and other technical labor and related overhead incurred in development and engineering consulting contracts and provisions for inventory and warranty 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues gross margin varies from period to period depending upon numerous variables including the mix of revenues from hardware  software  development and engineering consulting contracts  the mix of revenues among the markets served by the company  the cost of raw materials  the cost of outsourced services and labor  operational efficiencies  actual production volume compared to planned volume  and the mix of applications for which the company s computer systems are sold 
historically  the company s gross margins on service revenues have been lower than on product revenues 
in addition  the company s gross margins from development contract revenues are typically lower than the company s gross margins from standard product revenues 
the company intends to continue to enter into development contracts and anticipates that the gross margins associated with development contract revenues will continue to be lower than its gross margins on standard product revenues 
mercury has made significant investments in research and development in an effort to maintain its technology leadership in digital signal and image processing 
mercury invested million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  in development activities associated with the company s key technology competencies as well as in activities that are targeted at developing new technologies and products 
the company expects research and development expenses to continue to increase as the company continues to develop products to serve its markets  all of which are subject to rapidly changing technology  frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards 
the ability to deliver superior technological performance on a timely and cost effective basis is a critical factor in securing design wins for future generations of defense electronics  medical imaging systems  and other commercial applications 
significant research and development spending by the company does not ensure that the company s computer systems will be designed into a customer s system 
because future production orders are usually contingent upon securing a design win  the company s operating results may fluctuate due to either obtaining or failing to obtain design wins for significant customer systems 
on april   the company completed its acquisition of myriad logic  inc myriad 
myriad is a leading developer of i o technology based in silver spring  maryland 
the acquisition of myriad expands mercury s capability to provide more of a total system solution and provide more system integration services 
the total purchase price of million consisted of million in cash plus million of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  the company recorded approximately million of goodwill and million of acquired intangible assets 
critical accounting policies and significant judgements and estimates the company has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such polices affect its reported and expected financial results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  bad debts  income taxes  warranties  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
for products with acceptance criteria that are not successfully demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance 
the company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
for long term contracts to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex equipment  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
revisions in contract cost estimates have the effect of adjusting earnings applicable to performance in prior periods in the current period 
anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which determined 
service revenue is recognized ratably over applicable contract periods or as the services are performed 
the company assesses collectibility of trade receivables based on a number of factors  including past transaction and collection history with a customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if the company determines that collectibility of a particular sale is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon receipt of payment from the customer 
inventories  which include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  the company uses consistent methodologies to evaluate inventories for net realizable value 
the company records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand and non cancelable on order inventory in excess of estimated usage 
the excess and obsolete inventory evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
if actual demand  product mix or possible alternative uses are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company assesses the impairment of acquired intangible assets  property and equipment and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important that could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to prior operating results projections  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the asset or the strategy for the company s overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of acquired intangible assets  property and equipment and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one of more of the above indicators of impairment  the company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by its management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in its current business model 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
realization of the company s net deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
the company believes that it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted income  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet its expectations of future income 
the company and certain officers of the company have been named as defendants in a former employee litigation matter 
the company s assumption and estimate with regard to this litigation matter is that a loss is not probable and no loss accrual has been recorded 
if the plaintiff was to prevail on his claims and this assumption proves incorrect  the litigation could have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the fair value of the company s cash and investment portfolio at june  approximated carrying value due to the short term duration 
interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for issues contained in the investment portfolio 
the resulting hypothetical fair value would not be materially different from the year end carrying value 
the company s mortgage note agreements have fixed interest rates 
a hypothetical change in interest rates impacts the fair value of the mortgage notes payable but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
interest rate risk was estimated as the potential change in fair value from a hypothetical increase and decrease in interest rates 
the hypothetical fair value would not be materially different from the year end carrying value 
foreign currency risk the company operates primarily in the united states 
to date  greater than of the company s revenues has been billed and collected in us dollars 
however  a portion of the company s business is conducted outside the united states through its foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom  japan  the netherlands and france  where business is transacted in non us dollar currencies 
accordingly  the company is subject to exposure from adverse movements in the exchange rates of these currencies 
the euro is used as the functional currency for the company s subsidiaries in france and the netherlands  while the local currency is used as the functional currency for the company s subsidiaries in the united kingdom and japan 
consequently  changes in the exchange rates of these currencies may impact the translation of the foreign subsidiaries statements of operations into us dollars  which may in turn affect the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the impact of the movements in foreign currency exchange rates has been immaterial for all periods 
the company has not entered into any financial derivatives instruments that expose it to material market risk  including any instruments designed to hedge the impact of foreign currency exposures
