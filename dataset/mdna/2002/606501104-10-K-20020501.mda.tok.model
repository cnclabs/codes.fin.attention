item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the company s sales are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities and the profitability and cash flows of oil and gas companies and seismic contractors  which in turn are affected by expectations regarding the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  energy prices and finding and development costs 
the company believes that during the latter half of  the exploration and production companies anticipated an extended period of low oil and gas prices and began to reduce their intended levels of expenditures for seismic data 
consolidation within the oil industry has also delayed seismic data acquisition projects 
declines in oil and natural gas prices  or expectations that the recent improvement in oil and natural gas prices will not hold  could cause the company s customers to alter their spending plans and adversely affect the company s results of operation and financial condition 
the company leases and sells seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies and oil and gas companies conducting land and transition zone seismic surveys worldwide 
the company provides short term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer s requirements and offers maintenance and support during the lease term

this seasonal leasing activity by the company s canadian customers has historically resulted in increased lease revenues in the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters
