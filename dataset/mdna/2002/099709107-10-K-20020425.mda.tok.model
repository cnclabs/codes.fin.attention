average cash requirements to open a new or expanded waldenbooks store range from million to million  depending on the size and format of the store 
the company plans to lease new store locations predominantly under operating leases 
the company plans to execute its expansion plans for borders superstores and other strategic initiatives principally with funds generated from operations and financing through the lease and credit facilities 
the company believes funds generated from operations  borrowings under the credit facility  and financing through the lease facility will be sufficient to fund its anticipated capital requirements for the next several years 
as discussed below  the credit and lease facilities expire in october  but the company expects to be able to successfully renew the facilities in the second quarter of the company believes that its borrowing rate may increase upon renewal of the facilities if financial market conditions remain unchanged 
the company currently has a share repurchase program in place with remaining authorization to repurchase approximately million 
during   and  million  million  and million of common stock was repurchased  respectively 
the company plans to continue the repurchase of its common stock throughout fiscal  subject to the company s share price and capital needs 
the company has a million multicurrency credit agreement the credit facility which expires in october borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate or an increment over libor at the company s option 
the credit facility contains covenants which limit  among other things  the company s ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make acquisitions  merge  declare dividends  dispose of assets  issue or repurchase its common stock in excess of million plus any proceeds and tax benefits resulting from stock option exercises and tax benefits resulting from restricted shares purchased by employees from the company  and require the company to meet certain financial measures regarding fixed charge coverage  leverage  and tangible net worth 
the company is prohibited under the credit facility from paying cash dividends on common shares 
the company has a million lease financing facility the lease facility to finance new stores and other property through operating leases which expires in october the lease facility provides financing to lessors through loans from a third party lender for up to of a project s cost 
it is expected that lessors will make equity contributions approximating of each project 
independent of its obligations as lessee  the company guarantees payment when due of all amounts required to be paid to the third party lender 
the principal amount guaranteed will be limited to approximately of the original cost of a project  so long as the company is not in default under the lease relating to such project 
the lease facility contains covenants and events of default that are similar to those contained in the credit facility described above 
to date  the company has not been required to perform under the guarantees described above 
in the event that the company should be required to perform  borrowings under the credit facility would be sufficient to meet its obligations 
management believes that the rental payments for properties financed through the lease facility may be lower than those which the company could obtain elsewhere due to  among other factors  i the lower borrowing rates available to the company s landlords under the facility and ii the fact that rental payments for properties financed through the facility do not include amortization of the principal amounts of the landlords indebtedness related to the properties 
rental payments relating to such properties will be adjusted when permanent financing is obtained to reflect the interest rates available at the time of the refinancing and the amortization of principal 
there were properties financed through the lease facility  with a financed value of million  at january  of this amount  the company has recorded million as capital leases on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company expects that the properties financed under the lease facility will either be transferred to a new facility currently under negotiation or be permanently financed

as a result  the company has categorized this prepaid rent amount as part of other assets in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding amount in accrued payroll and other liabilities  since the payment did not occur until after the company s fiscal year end 
the prepaid amount will be amortized over each property s remaining lease term 
the following table summarizes the company s significant financing and lease obligations fiscal year and thereafter total dollars in millions credit facility borrowings capital lease obligations operating lease obligations mortgage repurchase obligation total lease facility guarantees includes million treated as capital lease obligations 
the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations since interest on the company s borrowings is principally based on variable rates 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company primarily utilizes interest rate swaps to achieve this objective  effectively converting a portion of its variable rate exposures to fixed interest rates 
libor is the rate upon which the company s variable rate debt and its payments under the lease facility are principally based 
if libor were to increase for the full year in as compared to the end of  the company s after tax earnings  after considering the effects of its existing interest rate swap agreements  would decrease million based on the company s expected average outstanding debt  including its indirect borrowings under the lease facility  as of january  a portion of the company s operations takes place in foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom  australia  new zealand and singapore 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company operates

actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting estimates 
asset impairments the carrying value of long lived assets is evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in performing such reviews for recoverability  the company compares the expected cash flows to the carrying value of long lived assets for each of its stores 
if the expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and its estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated using expected discounted future cash flows 
to the extent that there is a significant deterioration in the performance of the company s stores  significant asset impairments may result 
inventory the company records reserves for shrinkage and non returnable inventory based on actual historical rates 
if future experience differs from these historical rates  the recorded amounts for inventory and cost of sales will be impacted 
the company includes certain distribution and other expenses in its inventory costs  particularly freight  distribution payroll  and certain occupancy expenses 
in addition  certain selling  general and administrative expenses are included in inventory costs 
these amounts approximate of total inventory 
the extent to which these costs are included in inventory is based on certain estimates of space and labor allocation
