item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction bj s wholesale club  inc  which previously had been a wholly owned subsidiary of waban inc  became a separate and independent public entity on july   when waban distributed to its stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the company s outstanding common stock the spin off 
unless noted otherwise  the fiscal year ended february  is referred to as other fiscal years are referred to in a similar manner 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company reviews its estimates on an ongoing basis and makes judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on a number of factors 
these factors include historical experience  guidance provided by outside experts and assumptions made by management that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this section summarizes critical accounting policies and the related judgments involved in their application 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of merchandise at the time of purchase by the customer 
membership fee revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the membership  which is typically twelve months 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined under the average cost method  or market 
the company recognizes the write down of slow moving or obsolete inventory in cost of sales when such write downs are probable and estimable 
records are maintained at the stockkeeping unit sku level 
a report that details the number of weeks of selling supply for each sku allows the merchandising staff to make timely markdown decisions to help maintain rapid inventory turnover  which is essential in the company s business 
the carrying value of any sku whose selling price is marked down to below cost is immediately reduced to that selling price 
the company takes physical inventories of merchandise on a cycle basis at every location each year 
a second physical inventory is taken at the end of the year at selected locations 
the company estimates a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the period between physical inventories 
this estimate is based on historical results of previous physical inventories  shrinkage trends or other judgments management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company reviews the realizability of its long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
current and expected operating results and cash flows and other factors are considered in connection with the company s reviews 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted net cash flows of individual clubs and consolidated net cash flows for long lived assets not identifiable to individual clubs 
significant judgments are made in projecting future cash flows and are based on a number of factors  including the maturity level of the club  historical experience of clubs with similar characteristics  recent trends and general economic assumptions 
impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired assets 
as of february   the company had not established a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets because those assets can be realized by offsetting deferred tax liabilities and future taxable income  which management believes will more likely than not be earned  based on the company s historical record and projected earnings 
significant changes in projections of future taxable income could result in the company s establishment of a valuation allowance  which would reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets 
during the fiscal year ended february   the company established reserves for its liability related to househome  inc househome leases 
pursuant to an agreement with the tjx companies  inc tjx  bj s had agreed to indemnify tjx for of househome s lease liabilities guaranteed by tjx through january  and for of any such liabilities thereafter 
househome filed for bankruptcy in november see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
bj s recorded liabilities are based on the present value of rent liabilities under the househome leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on estimated borrowing rates for the company based on the weighted average period of time over which these obligations are expected to be paid 
a considerable amount of judgment was involved in determining bj s net liability related to househome leases  particularly in estimating potential sublease income 
the company obtained an independent appraisal to help make this determination 
assumptions included an average period of time it would take to sublease the properties and the amount of potential sublease income for each property 
net payments that the company makes to settle its lease indemnification obligations will reduce operating cash flows in varying amounts over the remaining terms of the househome leases  which expire at various times up to instead of subleasing the properties  bj s may satisfy its obligations through lump sum settlements  which could result in accelerated cash outflows 
the company believes that the liabilities recorded in the balance sheet adequately provide for its obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s actual liability under the tjx indemnification agreement will not vary materially from amounts recorded in the financial statements due to a number of factors  including future economic factors which may affect the ability to successfully sublease the househome properties 
the company is primarily self insured for worker s compensation and general liability claims 
reported reserves for these claims are derived from estimated ultimate costs based upon individual claim file reserves and estimates for incurred but not reported claims 
estimates are based on historical loss development factors  valuations provided by third party actuaries and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company is involved in various legal proceedings that are typical of a retail business 
along with outside legal counsel  the company assesses its exposure related to these proceedings and determines the amount of accruals required  if any  for these contingencies

business members renewed at a rate of and inner circle members renewed at a rate of in cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs was of net sales in  in and in the increase in the cost of sales percentage from to was attributable mainly to the increased sales contribution of gasoline  higher expenses for utilities and other occupancy costs  and initial excess capacity at the company s new cross dock facility in burlington  new jersey 
the increase in the cost of sales percentage from to was due primarily to the increased contribution of gasoline sales 
the gross margin on gas is significantly lower than the overall gross margin for the rest of bj s business 
excluding gas  merchandise gross margin as a percentage of sales rose slightly over the previous year in both and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were of net sales in  in and in the sg a percentage was favorably impacted in the last two years by leveraging fixed expenses against both increased comparable store sales and a growing number of clubs  by effective control over operating expenses  particularly payroll  and by increased gasoline sales  which have low related sg a costs 
significant technology investments made over the past few years have been a key factor in increasing payroll efficiency

the increase from to was due primarily to higher invested cash balances 
see note k of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the components of interest income and expense 
the company recorded pretax charges of million in for its estimated loss associated with househome  inc househome leases 
on an after tax basis  these charges were million  or 
per diluted share 
househome filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code on november  both bj s and househome formerly homebase  inc had been part of waban inc 
prior to and were part of the tjx companies  inc tjx prior to in connection with the spin off of waban from tjx in  waban agreed to indemnify tjx against any liabilities tjx might incur with respect to these leases 
pursuant to a subsequent agreement  bj s agreed to indemnify tjx for of househome s lease liabilities guaranteed by tjx through january  and for of any such liabilities thereafter 
the loss on contingent lease obligations recorded in was based on the present value of rent liabilities under househome leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of the obligations 
the company s income tax provision was of pretax income in  in and in the decrease in the rates from to was due primarily to the effect of the tax benefit on the loss of contingent lease obligations  which was recorded at an incremental tax rate of 
excluding the loss on contingent lease obligations  the company s income tax was of pretax income in the company s effective state income tax rates have decreased slightly in each of the last two fiscal years

the company expects to continue to benefit in from the membership fee increases that became effective january  because members renew throughout the year and because membership fee income is realized over the life of the membership  the benefit of the fee increases is spread over a two year period 
the company expects that this benefit will be partially offset by the effect of higher than normal medical cost inflation on employee benefit costs  significantly higher property insurance costs in the wake of the terrorist attacks on september  and comparative excess capacity in the first quarter at the company s new cross dock facility  which opened in april in burlington  new jersey 
interest income is also projected to be lower than last year for the first half of because of considerably lower interest rates 
a more evenly distributed schedule of new club openings in compared to  when all new clubs were opened in the second half of the year  is expected to create uneven quarterly comparisons in preopening expenses 
based on the club opening schedule  these costs are projected to be higher than last year in the first two quarters and lower than last year in the third and fourth quarters 
the company plans to test pharmacies in the five new atlanta clubs scheduled to open in and in three existing massachusetts clubs  which are being retrofitted for this business 
because atlanta is a market where bj s has no other clubs  very limited name recognition and two entrenched competitors  the company also plans to test a program of free first year memberships during the preopening and initial opening periods of the new atlanta clubs 
in  the company plans to roll out a new bj s co branded mastercard underwritten by a major financial institution on a non recourse basis 
purchases made at bj s with the co branded mastercard will earn a rebate 
all other purchases with the bj s mastercard will earn rebates ranging from 
to 
rebates up to per year per membership account will be issued in the form of bj s bucks certificates redeemable for merchandise at any bj s club 
seasonality the company s business  in common with the business of retailers generally  is subject to seasonal influences 
the company s sales and operating income have typically been strongest in the fourth quarter holiday season and lowest in the first quarter of each fiscal year

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in and million in the lower amount in was attributable mainly to the decrease in cash provided by the change in accounts payable 
accounts payable balances were higher than normal at the beginning of due in part to the january replenishment of inventories in categories with millennium related demand  much of which was paid for after the end of january cash provided by net income before depreciation and amortization and the post tax loss on contingent lease obligations was million in versus million in and million in cash expended for property additions was million in versus million in included in s property additions was million of cash expended for clubs that will open in the company opened twelve new clubs in and eleven new clubs in  and relocated one club in each year 
five of the openings were at owned locations 
two of the openings and the relocated club whose land was purchased in were at owned locations 
the company also opened new gas stations in and new gas stations in the company expects that capital expenditures will total approximately million in  based on opening or new clubs and to gas stations  purchasing one club which was previously leased and providing initial capital for a third cross dock facility scheduled to open in florida in the spring of the company expects to own approximately four of the new club locations opening in and also plans to spend approximately million in for clubs that will open in the timing of actual club openings and the amount of related expenditures could vary from these estimates due  among other things  to the complexity of the real estate development process 
in may and september of  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million and million  respectively  of the company s common stock in addition to the million previously authorized 
during  the company repurchased  shares of common stock for million  or an average price of per share 
from the inception of its share repurchase activities in august  the company has repurchased a total of million of common stock at an average cost of per share 
as of february   the company s remaining repurchase authorization was million 
the company has a million unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks which expires july  the agreement includes a million sub facility for letters of credit  of which million was outstanding at february  the company is required to pay an annual facility fee which is currently of the total commitment 
interest on borrowings is payable at the company s option either at a the eurodollar rate plus a margin which is currently  b the agent bank s prime rate or c a rate determined by competitive bidding 
the facility fee and eurodollar margin are both subject to change based upon the company s fixed charge coverage ratio 
the agreement contains covenants which  among other things  include minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage requirements and a maximum funded debt to capital limitation  and prohibit the payment of cash dividends on the company s common stock 
in september  the agreement was amended to generally limit the cumulative repurchase of the company s common stock to million plus of net income as defined by the agreement earned after january  the company is in compliance with the covenants and other requirements set forth in its credit agreement 
bj s has no credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity date of debt if borrowings were outstanding under its credit agreement 
the company expects to enter into a new credit agreement before the current agreement expires 
the company also maintains a separate million facility for letters of credit  primarily to support the purchase of inventories  of which million was outstanding at february   and an additional million uncommitted credit line for short term borrowings 
increases in inventories and accounts payable from february  to february  were due mainly to the addition of new clubs 
increases in deferred tax assets since the end of last year were attributable primarily to the recording of related liabilities for lease indemnification obligations in payments that the company makes to settle its lease indemnification obligations will reduce operating cash flows in varying amounts over the remaining terms of the househome leases  which expire at various times up to as of february   the present value of these obligations totaled million  including million classified as current liabilities 
this reflects the fact that bj s is responsible for of househome s lease liabilities through january  and the assumption of a certain average time period before sublease income begins to be realized 
bj s and tjx share equal responsibility for househome s leases after january  the company may satisfy its obligations through lump sum settlements  which could accelerate the timing of cash outflows 
the company believes that these payments will not have a material impact on its future financial condition or cash flows and that the liabilities recorded in the financial statements adequately provide for its indemnification obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s actual liability under the tjx indemnification agreement will not differ materially from amounts recorded in the financial statements due to a number of factors  including future economic factors which may affect the ability to successfully sublease the househome properties 
the following summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations as of february  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands contingent capital operating lease payments due by period total leases leases obligations less than year    years     more than years    cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of february   and there were no borrowings outstanding on that date 
based on the expectation that a new credit agreement will be in place before the current agreement expires  the company believes that its current resources  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to finance its operations through the term of the new credit agreement 
however  the company may from time to time seek to obtain additional financing 
factors which could affect future operating results this report contains a number of forward looking statements  including statements regarding membership fee income  employee medical benefit costs and preopening expenses  planned capital expenditures  planned store and gas station openings  lease obligations under the company s indemnification agreement with tjx  and other information with respect to the company s plans and strategies 
any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  estimates  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause actual events or the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements  including  without limitation  the factors set forth below and other factors noted elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  particularly those noted under critical accounting policies and estimates 
in addition  any forward looking statements represent the company s estimates only as of the day this annual report was first filed with the securities and exchange commission and should not be relied upon as representing the company s estimates as of any subsequent date 
while the company may elect to update forward looking statements at some point in the future  the company specifically disclaims any obligation to do so  even if its estimates change 
bj s warehouse clubs are located in the eastern united states  primarily in the northeast 
the company s business may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns in its markets 
in addition  the company may be impacted by state and local regulation in its markets and temporarily impacted by weather conditions prevailing in its markets 
the company competes with national  regional and local retailers and wholesalers  including national chains in the warehouse merchandising business  some of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than the company  which could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in connection with the spin off in  waban received a letter ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that  for federal income tax purposes  the distribution of the company s stock to waban s stockholders the distribution and related asset transfers would be tax free to waban s stockholders 
certain future events not within the control of the company or househome  including  for example  certain dispositions of the company s common stock or househome s common stock  could cause the distribution not to qualify for tax free treatment 
if this occurred  the related tax liability would be payable by househome  although the company has agreed to indemnify househome under certain circumstances for all or a portion of such tax liability
