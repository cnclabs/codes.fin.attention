item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations overview the company is a holding company which has owned jm ney as its primary operating subsidiary since the company also has made equity investments in both marketable and other securities of domestic and foreign based companies 
it holds a ownership interest in moscow broadband which in turn holds a equity interest in comcor tv  a russian company which delivers cable television  high speed data transmission and internet services to its subscribers 
comcor tv is a start up venture which is currently expanding its network and increasing its customer base to those homes and businesses to which it presently has access 
subsequent to february   the company sold the operating assets of jm ney and began to liquidate the net current assets  including accounts receivable and certain inventory balances  which it did not sell to the buyer of jm ney 
the company also entered into an agreement which  subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals  will result in comcor tv being substantially wholly owned by the company through the purchase of of comcor tv and the proposed purchase of substantially all of the shares of moscow broadband that the company does not presently own 
the agreement calls for comcor to contribute operating and other assets to comcor tv and for the company and moscow broadband to make cash capital contributions to comcor tv totaling approximately million  of which approximately million was paid in may based upon the foregoing  the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and the financial conditions of the company will not be indicative of the company s expectations of its future results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  income taxes  financing operations  retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
product return and warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost of returns and product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
should actual product returns and rework costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated returns reserve may be required 
inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions regarding future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
pursuant to the provisions of the sale of jm ney s operating assets  a portion of the proceeds from sale are held in escrow for changes in demand and market conditions of jm ney s products from certain defined levels 
in the future reporting periods  any unfavorable changes in demand or market conditions from those defined levels will affect the company s ability to realize the proceeds held in escrow 
the company recorded its precious metals inventories on a last in  first out lifo basis under which inventories are valued at their historical costs 
this method results in cost of sales reflecting current period prices except when inventory levels are permanently reduced 
as historical layers are depleted  cost of sales reflects the historical costs as opposed to their current prices 
deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
when the company determines that it may not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated recoverable amounts is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  a reduction in the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
investment in moscow broadband the company records its investment in moscow broadband using the equity method which also requires that the carrying value of the investment be evaluated for impairment 
if comcor tv does not receive the planned increases to its equity capital or other sources of financing  the company s carrying value of moscow broadband could be adversely impacted

comcor tv is currently dependent upon additional sources of capital

the company may also reduce its obligation by arranging for a financing of comcor tv or moscow broadband  which if successful  would result in the dilution of the company s ownership of comcor tv 
however  depending on market conditions  such sources of cash may still be inadequate to meet the scheduled payments into comcor tv and still provide the company with sufficient liquidity to meet its administrative expenses and debt service obligations 
in the event that such liquidity needs are not met  comcor tv s business plans  and possibly even its on going viability as a going concern may be put at risk

the company s investment in moscow broadband is also at risk based upon moscow broadband s ability to raise sufficient equity capital at appropriate values to enable it to provide comcor tv additional equity capital in order for moscow broadband to maintain its equity share in comcor tv 
additionally  the degree of success of comcor tv to add sufficient subscribers for its cable television and internet access services at adequate rates  and for comcor tv to obtain sufficient equity and debt financing to fund its infrastructure build out and near term projected operating losses  will also significantly affect the value of the company s investment in moscow broadband
