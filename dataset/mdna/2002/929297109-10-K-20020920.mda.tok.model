item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fiscal significant events and trends technology improvement plan in january  we announced a three part technology improvement plan to stabilize the operating system software in our gaming devices due to various software anomalies experienced with the existing operating system software 
we had first reported in april that our gaming machines experienced software anomalies that permitted fraudulent player manipulation 
in the spring and summer of  we implemented software changes and upgraded our games on casino floors to version b or of our operating system software that we believed resolved these particular anomalies 
in november  we identified and reported to gaming regulators two other operating system software issues with our games in nevada and mississippi 
we believe these issues  which did not permit fraudulent player manipulation but resulted in disappearing or excessive credits  related to an upgrade of the operating system software to version that we installed at the request of the regulators in these two jurisdictions in october and november as a result of these anomalies and the publicity concerning them  in the december  march  and june quarters  we experienced delays in receiving regulatory approvals for new games by some regulators pending completion of the review of upgrades to our existing operating system software 
customers  aware of the three part technology improvement plan  purchased fewer new gaming devices from us 
this resulted in lower game sales in these quarters 
the game approval delays also had a negative impact on participation game revenue because we were unable to refresh our installed base of participation games on our planned six month schedule 
in january  we announced that we would simultaneously execute the following three part technology improvement plan in the near term  we are rewriting critical operating code segments  securing third party critiques of our design process  and performing code audits and other software tests in order to improve the stability of the operating system by introducing two upgrades to our existing operating system 
in the mid term  we plan to develop  license or acquire a new operating system for our newly developed hardware platform 
in the long term  we plan to develop a next generation system  which we believe will integrate leading technologies for the gaming industry and serve as our primary system in the future 
also in january  our board of directors established an executive committee of the board to oversee the execution of our technology improvement plan 
mr 
louis j 
nicastro  our chairman of the board of directors and a non employee director  was appointed chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors 
in march  we completed the initial programming and testing of version of the operating system software  the first of the two upgrades to our existing operating system software to address the known causes of the software anomalies we had experienced to date 
in early june  we received approval from mississippi regulators for version of our operating system software 
we upgraded all of our gaming devices in mississippi to version by june  as a result of the improvements on version of our operating system software  in early august  we received approval for our first new game theme in mississippi in ten months 
in august  we received approval for version of the operating system software from the nevada regulators 
we expect to begin the upgrade of all of our existing games in nevada casinos in september in september we received our first game theme approval from nevada regulators 
all new game approvals for all jurisdictions will now be on version or higher of the operating system software until the next version of the operating system software is approved 
at this time  only one other jurisdiction  ontario  canada has required an upgrade of the operating system in our existing gaming devices in their jurisdiction 
other jurisdictions could require an upgrade in the future 
we have developed the second upgrade our operating system software  version  upon which we expect to begin receiving regulatory approvals in the winter of this upgrade is currently being tested before submission to the regulators 
this second upgrade contains modest enhancements  modest robustness improvements and some new functionality to our games 
with regard to the mid term plan  in addition to an internal development alternative  we have entered into a paid up licensing agreement for a proprietary new computer circuit board and operating system from sdg  which we expect will meet our requirements as to design  quality  architecture and functionality 
we expect to make our first submission of the operating system to regulators in the march quarter and begin receiving regulatory approvals on the mid term solution in the summer of in conjunction with a new gaming device platform we have developed 
at the same time  we expect the computer circuit board and operating system to be retrofittable into our installed base of over  games already in casinos 
for the long term plan  we contracted with an independent specialist to develop the design specification for our next generation system 
we received the completed design specification and were able to have several of the components of this specification included in the operating system that sdg is currently designing for us 
we currently intend to use the sdg system as the foundation for our long term solution 
to partially offset an anticipated reduction in revenues and an expected increase in research and development expenses to implement the technology improvement plan  we reduced our workforce in january we recorded a non recurring  pre tax charge of million  or per diluted share after tax  in the december quarter for employee separation costs 
while we have begun to receive approvals for new games in mississippi and in nevada  we anticipate that our revenues from sales of new gaming devices in fiscal will improve only modestly over the  units we sold in fiscal we believe customers will wait to purchase our gaming devices until the mid term solution is available beginning in the summer of  as that system is expected to be an improvement over the existing operating system  and it will have a variety of features and functionality needed by our customers that the upgrades to our existing system lack 
we do expect that revenues from game conversions will be stronger in fiscal as customers will refresh existing wms gaming devices with new games 
we also expect to be able to refresh our participation games with greater frequency in fiscal  than in fiscal  which should improve the net win per day for those gaming devices 
other recent matters in fiscal  we completed the renovation of our former manufacturing facility in chicago to a state of the art technology campus for our game development and engineering staff 
the facility provides greater features and functionality to our product development staff and contains room for expansion as we increase our headcount in order to implement our business strategy to be able to meet all of the gaming device needs of our casino customers 
the september attack on america caused a reduction in overall levels of business and leisure airline travel 
the reduced travel had an adverse effect on the casino and gaming industry particularly in nevada 
with the impact of the september attacks exacerbating the general economic slowdown  we believe nevada based casino operators reassessed and lowered their capital spending and leasing plans especially for the december and march quarters 
we experienced reduced game play on our participation games in the december quarter  particularly in las vegas casinos 
we elected to delay the launch of the ninth monopoly branded participation game  party train  from the september quarter to bring this product to market when casino patronage levels would likely return to more normal levels in nevada 
we launched the monopoly party train game in nevada in october and in most other gaming jurisdictions later in the december quarter 
the next version in this series  hot properties  is scheduled for launch in october  with the eleventh version  free parking  expected to be launched in the spring of we expect to see an increase in the monopoly series installed base subject to receipt of regulatory approvals following the upgrade of our operating system software 
we also delayed the launch of the hollywood squares themed participation games pending stabilization of casino patronage levels  introducing it in january at four harrah s properties 
harrah s has a limited exclusivity period for the hollywood squares participation games in all jurisdictions in which harrah s operates 
we received regulatory approvals to introduce the product at additional harrah s properties in the march quarter  with the remaining regulatory approvals anticipated following implementation of the upgrade to our existing operating system software 
we expect to install this game in most remaining jurisdictions during the september and december quarters  and we expect to have a new version of hollywood squares approved for introduction in the march quarter 
in april  we introduced survivor as a wide area progressive game under our agreement with igt  which uses igt s megajackpots wide area progressive operating system and gaming platform 
by june   two wide area progressive links were established nevada and native american 
the game will be distributed on a wide area link in other jurisdictions as well as on a stand alone participation basis in those jurisdictions in which achieving a critical mass of games on a wide area link is unlikely 
approvals in all major north american gaming jurisdictions are expected to be received by december in may  we introduced pac man as a new series of branded participation games at four park place entertainment  inc properties in atlantic city 
park place has a limited exclusivity period for pac man participation games in all jurisdictions in which park place operates 
we have received additional regulatory approvals to introduce the product in other jurisdictions with the remaining regulatory approvals anticipated following the upgrade of our operating system software 
we expect to install this game in most of remaining jurisdictions during the september and december quarters and expect to release a new version of pac man  called ms 
pac man  in the march quarter 
effective march   we issued a restricted stock grant of  shares of our common stock held in treasury to mr 
louis j 
nicastro  our chairman of the board of directors and a non employee director 
this grant was issued in consideration for his agreeing to serve as chairman of the executive committee of the board directors  which was established to provide enhanced oversight of the timely completion of our technology improvement plan 
the restricted stock grant vests on june   subject to the board of directors satisfaction of the fulfillment of specified performance conditions relating to the company s technology improvement plan 
the tax effected market value of the restricted stock grant at the date of the grant is recorded as unearned restricted stock as a separate component of stockholders equity and adjusted to current market value as of the balance sheet date 
under terms of the grant  the shares vest upon death  disability or change in control 
when it becomes probable that fulfillment of the performance conditions will be met  the market value of the restricted stock at that time will be recorded as compensation expense 
critical accounting policies we value inventory based on estimates of potentially excess and obsolete inventory after considering forecasted demand and forecasted average selling prices 
however  forecasts are subject to revisions  cancellations and rescheduling 
in fiscal  we expect to introduce a new gaming platform  which will likely accelerate the obsolescence of existing product lines 
in addition  demand for parts inventory is subject to technical obsolescence 
inventory on hand in excess of forecasted demand is written down to market value 
actual demand may differ from anticipated demand  and such differences may have a material effect on the financial statements 
we depreciate our participation gaming devices and top boxes for participation games over a two year useful life to a small salvage value 
a material impact could occur if the actual useful life of the participation gaming devices or top boxes is less than what was used in estimating depreciation expense  or if actual salvage value is less than the anticipated salvage value 
we license intellectual property from third parties for certain of our gaming machines 
as part of our contracts with the licensors  we typically provide a guaranteed minimum royalty and prepayment of royalties  usually at the time the contract is signed even though the product may not be introduced until months or years later 
we capitalize the prepaid royalty as other assets 
at june   the minimum guaranteed royalty payments totaled million of which million has been paid and the balance is payable over various periods up to five years 
in addition  the contracts provide for an additional million of contingent royalty payments based upon future events occurring 
total prepaid royalties at june  were million of which million is in other current assets and million is in other assets 
subsequent to june   we entered into new license and distribution agreements with guaranteed minimum royalties of million  contingent royalty payments of an additional million and paid advanced royalty payments of million 
we amortize prepaid royalties when the product is introduced  based upon contractual terms of the license agreements or the term of the license as revenue is earned 
if we determine that the products we develop will not fully recover the guaranteed minimum amounts  we would record an immediate charge against earnings once such determination is made 
as part of our technology improvement plan discussed above  we have pursued alternative strategies for each phase of the plan  including licensing technologies from third parties 
at june   our minimum guaranteed payments related to the technology alternatives totaled million  which had been paid as advances with an additional million of contingent royalty payments based on future events  and such amounts are included in the amounts described above 
in july  we entered into another licensed technology agreement with an additional minimum guarantee of million  contingent royalty payments of an additional million and paid advance royalty payments of million and such amounts are included in the amounts described above as subsequent to june  if we determine that we will not realize the value of the guaranteed commitment for a particular licensed technology alternative  we will record an immediate charge against earnings at the time of such determination of up to million if all of the alternatives were to have no further value to us 
we accrue expenses related to warranty  employee benefits  software anomalies and other contingencies based upon our best estimates of the costs that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable 
such estimates are updated monthly based on current information  however  such changes in estimates or actual expenses may exceed accrued amounts 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to all legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and normal operation of a long lived asset 
this statement is effective for our fiscal year 
we expect that adopting sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that the same accounting model be used to recognize an impairment loss for long lived assets  whether they are to be held and used  disposed of by sale  or disposed of other than by sale 
this would apply to both previously held and used or newly acquired assets 
it also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
this statement is effective for our fiscal year 
we expect that adopting sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million at june   exclusive of million of restricted cash  along with our million bank revolving line of credit that extends to may   and cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our anticipated level of capital expenditures  cash to be invested in participation games  working capital required in the operation of our business  and increased research and development spending 
our short term investments primarily consist of auction market preferred stocks stated at cost  which approximates market value 
these investments generally have no fixed maturity date but have dividend reset dates every days or more 
these investments can be liquidated under an auction process on the dividend reset dates subject to a sufficient number of bids being submitted 
our policy is to invest cash with issuers that have a high credit rating and to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we expect that  to implement our technology improvement plan  our expenditures on research and development over the next year will increase over fiscal levels due to increased head counts and associated expenses 
we expect to add over engineers and support staff for this effort  along with additional game development staff to increase the number of game themes we commercialize 
we intend to maintain an increased level of research and development expenditures over the long term in order to execute our plan of broadening our product line and developing our next generation operating system 
we are not dependent on off balance sheet financing arrangements to fund our operations 
we utilize financing arrangements for operating leases of facilities and equipment and for minimum guaranteed royalty payments as follows payment due by period s more less than than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases    minimum royalty payments   total contractual cash obligations    we do not have any special purpose entities for investment or the conduct of our operations 
we do have an agreement with igt for the operation of a wide area progressive system 
the purpose of this agreement is to combine our licensing rights and game design expertise with igt s wide area progressive system 
under this agreement  we record in our consolidated financial statements our proportionate share of revenues and costs from operating activities  and the full value of assets we own and liabilities we incur in connection with this arrangement 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments 
we do have a restricted stock grant and stock options granted to employees  members of our board of directors and consultants 
we do not currently have any significant firm purchase commitments for raw material inventory 
cash provided by continuing operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was million for fiscal  as compared to cash provided of million for fiscal the decrease was due to million of decreased net income and million of lower tax benefits from the exercise of common stock options in the current fiscal year  partially offset by million of greater depreciation and amortization 
the changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in million of cash inflow for fiscal  compared with a cash outflow of million during the prior fiscal year 
cash inflow for fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in receivables  as a result of lower sales  and inventories  partially offset by an increase in other current assets 
the decrease in receivables and inventories is due to a reduced level of overall business and our efforts to reduce inventory levels 
the cash outflow for fiscal was primarily due to an increase in receivables  inventories  current refundable taxes  and other assets  and a decrease in current liabilities due to payments of liabilities of discontinued operations from comparable balances at june   partially offset by a smaller increase in accounts receivable 
cash used by investing activities was million for fiscal  compared with cash used of million for fiscal cash used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment for fiscal was million  compared with million for fiscal this increase resulted from the final phases of improvements made to our waukegan  illinois headquarters and manufacturing facility and the renovation and conversion of our chicago facility from a manufacturing facility to a technology campus 
cash used for additions to participation games was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in installed games was  units in fiscal  and units in fiscal the participation game expenditures in fiscal reflect the relatively greater number of top box conversions and higher component costs 
we used million of cash in fiscal for the acquisition of big foot software  which is engaged in the design and development of our proprietary wide area progressive system 
we also received million of cash on the sale of land and a building to midway games inc which they had previously been renting from us 
net cash of million was used for the purchase of short term investments for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal cash provided by financing activities  which was from the exercise of common stock options  was million for fiscal compared with million for the prior fiscal year due to a lower number of option exercises 
in january  our board of directors authorized a twelve month  million common stock repurchase program 
this allowed us to purchase our stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
during the year ended june   we repurchased  shares for an aggregate price of million 
by july   we had completed our million repurchase program purchasing a total of  shares or approximately of outstanding shares  at an average price of per share 
in september  our board of directors authorized an expansion of the stock repurchase program by million for the next twelve months 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal total revenue decreased million million from decreased product sales partially offset by an million increase in participation game revenue 
we shipped  video and mechanical reel type gaming devices in the current fiscal year  resulting in product and parts sales of million versus  gaming devices shipped and million of product and parts sales in the prior fiscal year 
gaming device sales were lower due to our inability to sell into certain jurisdictions until the summer of upgrade of our operating system software was approved 
the average sales price increased from  in the prior fiscal year to  in the current fiscal year  primarily due to a change in our mix of products sold 
the increase in participation game revenue was due to an increase in the installed base of participation games to a total of  units installed at june   compared to  units installed at june  the installed base increased due to the introduction of three new series of participation games hollywood squares  pac man  and survivor 
average net win per day per machine decreased from in fiscal to in the current fiscal year 
this decrease resulted primarily from the lack of approvals for new game titles to refresh the installed base of monopoly and puzzle pays participation games as regulators awaited approval of the summer of upgrade of our operating system software 
the back orders for our participation games stood at over  units as of june  consolidated gross profit in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the gross margin percentage increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in the gross margin percentage resulted from the impact of higher margin participation game revenues being of total revenue in fiscal versus of total revenues in fiscal the gross margin on product sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to lower overall sales of products 
the gross profit margin on participation game revenues decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal due to higher replacement part and conversion costs on fully depreciated machines still in service and the lower average net revenue per day per machine 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in the current fiscal year to million from million in fiscal as we continued to invest in people and technologies to develop new games  product platforms and operating systems  to execute on our three part technology improvement plan  and to pursue our business strategy to become a full service gaming device provider to our customers 
the increase was primarily due to higher engineering expenditures and increased headcount  and included costs to adapt our games for distribution to international markets 
we anticipate that higher staffing levels will allow us to increase the number of new games we introduce in the coming years 
during fiscal  we introduced five new games for sale and four new participation games 
selling and administrative expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in the current fiscal year 
the fiscal amount includes a million pre tax charge for an executive buyout agreement
