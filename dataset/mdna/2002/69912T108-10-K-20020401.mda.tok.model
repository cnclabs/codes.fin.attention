actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues on sales contracts  accounted for in accordance with sop of the american institute of certified public accountants  are recorded on the basis of the company s estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts 
gross margin is recognized on the basis of the ratio of aggregate costs incurred to date to the most recent estimate of total costs 
installation is an integral part of most systems sold by the company and is not sold or billed separately

the company provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs and potential product liability claims based upon a percentage of cost of sales and warranty experience 
historically  the level of warranty reserve has been appropriate based on management s assessment of estimated future warranty claims 
however  if unanticipated warranty issues arise in the future  there could be a significant impact on the recorded warranty reserve 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market 
inventories primarily consist of materials purchased or manufactured for stock 
the company does not defer general and administrative costs or initial startup costs 
the company provides an inventory reserve determined by a specific identification of individual slow moving items and a general reserve to cover other inventory items based on historical experience 
the reserve is considered to be a write down of inventory to a new cost basis 
upon disposal of inventory  the cost and related inventory reserve are removed from the accounts
