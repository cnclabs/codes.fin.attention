critical accounting estimates and judgments the consolidated financial statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management for those transactions that are not yet complete or for which the ultimate effects are uncertain 
such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
those estimates and judgments that were most critical to the preparation of the financial statements involved the adequacy of loss reserves and  to a lesser extent  the fair value of credit derivative obligations and the recoverability of the carrying value of real estate properties 
these estimates and judgments are discussed within the following analysis of our results of operations 
if different estimates and judgments had been applied  materially different amounts might have been reported in the financial statements 
earnings summary operating income  which excludes realized investment gains and losses  was million in compared with million in and million in operating income in was adversely affected by two large loss events 
in the third quarter  we incurred net costs of million  or million after tax  related to the september attack in the united states 
then  in the fourth quarter  we recognized net surety bond losses of million  or million after tax  arising from the bankruptcy of enron corp 
net income  which includes realized investment gains and losses  was million in compared with million in and million in property and casualty insurance overview our property and casualty business incurred an operating loss before taxes of million in compared with operating income of million in and million in excluding the net costs of million related to the september attack and the net surety bond losses of million related to enron  operating income before taxes was million in  similar to that in the higher earnings in compared with were due primarily to an improvement in underwriting results  caused in large part by substantially lower catastrophe losses 
a summary of our property and casualty insurance operating results for the years ended december   and is included in the supplementary financial data on page of the corporation s annual report to shareholders 
the summary on page of our property and casualty insurance operating results for also presents such results excluding the impact of the september attack and shows the impact of the september attack separately

total attack attack in millions underwriting net premiums written increase in unearned premiums premiums earned claims and claim expenses operating costs and expenses increase in deferred policy acquisition costs dividends to policyholders total claims and expenses underwriting loss investment income amortization of goodwill and other charges property and casualty income loss before tax the pre tax costs of million related to the september attack had three components 
first  in our insurance business  we incurred estimated net claims and claim expenses of million plus reinsurance reinstatement costs of million  for an aggregate cost of million 
second  in our reinsurance business written through chubb re  which is included in other specialty results  we incurred estimated net claims and claim expenses of million and recognized net reinstatement premium revenue of million  for a net cost of million 
finally  we recorded a million charge  included in other charges  as our share of the losses publicly estimated by hiscox plc  a uk insurer in which we have a interest 
we estimate that our gross claims and claim expenses from the september attack were about billion 
most of the claims were from property exposure and business interruption losses 
we also had significant workers compensation losses 
our net claims and claim expenses of million were significantly lower than the gross amount due to various reinsurance agreements 
our property exposures were protected by facultative reinsurance  a property per risk treaty that limited our net loss per risk  and our property catastrophe treaty 
our workers compensation losses were protected by a casualty catastrophe treaty and a casualty clash treaty 
based on our review of our reinsurance programs  we estimated the amount of reinsurance recoverable 
we believe the estimate is reasonable based on information available at the present time 
we have also modeled the estimated recoveries by individual reinsurer 
based on this analysis  we estimate that of our reinsurance is with reinsurers or markets rated investment grade or rated a or better by am best company 
business interruption claims from the september attack will take some time to settle  while potential liability claims  if initiated  could take years to settle 
given that  we have no evidence of any emerging issues that would cause us to change our reserve estimates 
while it is possible that our estimate of ultimate net losses related to the september attack may change in the future  we do not expect that any such change would have a material effect on the corporation s consolidated financial condition or liquidity 
underwriting results underwriting results by class of business for the years ended december   and are presented on page of the corporation s annual report to shareholders 
in  we formed three strategic business units chubb personal insurance  chubb commercial insurance and chubb specialty insurance 
in conjunction with the formation of the strategic business units  we have reclassified property and marine business from our specialty insurance segment to our commercial insurance segment and also reclassified some business that was included within executive protection to multiple peril 
prior year amounts have been reclassified 
each of our underwriting segments was affected by the september attack 
however  the greatest impact by far was on our financial institutions business  which is part of our specialty insurance segment 
due to the distorting effect of the september attack on our underwriting results  the remaining discussion and analysis of our underwriting results excludes the impact of the september attack  unless otherwise noted 
the following is a summary of our underwriting results for by class of business excluding the impact of the september attack 
combined net loss and premiums expense written ratios in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance executive protection financial institutions other a total specialty  a total  a a includes the effect of net surety bond losses of million related to enron 
excluding the effect of the enron surety losses  the combined loss and expense ratio was for other specialty  for total specialty and in total 
net premiums written were billion in  an increase of over reported net premiums written increased in compared with reported premium growth in was affected by the inclusion of premiums written by executive risk inc since july  the date it was acquired by the corporation 
executive risk was a specialty insurance company offering primarily directors and officers and errors and omissions coverages 
excluding the effect of the acquisition of executive risk  premium growth was in substantial premium growth was achieved in and outside the united states  particularly in europe  our largest foreign market 
non us premiums grew in both and in local currencies 
however  due to the strength of the us dollar  particularly in  reported us premiums increased by in and only in personal coverages accounted for billion or of net premiums written  commercial coverages for billion or and specialty coverages for billion or 
premium growth in personal lines was strong in both and in our commercial classes  which include multiple peril  casualty  workers compensation and property and marine  premiums decreased in as higher prices were more than offset by lower retention rates  the latter due in part to our pruning of underperforming accounts where we could not attain price adequacy 
the marketplace continued to improve in with many of our competitors increasing rates even before september as a result  our commercial lines premiums began to increase in  particularly in the fourth quarter  as we retained more of our business and wrote more new business 
premium growth in the specialty lines was restricted in  primarily due to the lack of growth in our executive protection business caused by our writing fewer multi year policies as well as our initiative to increase pricing and to not renew underperforming accounts 
the tragic event of september and its aftermath have accelerated changes in commercial insurance markets 
in the wake of heavy insurance industry losses  many insurance companies have sought substantial price increases  raised deductibles  reduced coverage limits or declined outright to renew coverage 
in this environment  we are seeing more opportunities to write new  high quality accounts and we are retaining more of our business 
we are getting substantial rate increases on business we write  often with more restrictive policy terms and conditions 
we expect that this trend will continue during at the same time  as a result of the substantial losses incurred by reinsurers  the cost of reinsurance in the marketplace is increasing significantly and reinsurance capacity for certain coverages  such as terrorism  is limited 
we are operating under the assumption that our reinsurers will not cover most forms of terrorism 
the insurance industry has asked for a government backstop for any future terrorist attacks 
however  congress has not enacted a legislative solution to terrorism related losses 
we expect that reinsurers will restructure our property per risk reinsurance to limit the amount of catastrophe risk covered by these treaties 
also  in many cases  we will have to retain a larger share of a loss before property per risk reinsurance applies 
we may not renew certain reinsurance programs because the terms being offered are too restrictive or because the programs have become prohibitively expensive 
in fact  effective in january  we did not renew a casualty catastrophe program that had substantially reduced our net workers compensation losses from the september attack 
our current property reinsurance program expires in april the potential increase in our net risk concentrations from a catastrophic event that would result from changes to our reinsurance arrangements may be offset to some degree by changes to our gross risk profile 
in particular  we are making a concerted effort to reduce terrorism risk aggregations 
a shortage of reinsurance capacity could constrain our ability to respond to business opportunities and could make our future operating results more volatile 
underwriting results were unprofitable in due primarily to the enron related surety bond losses described below  compared with near breakeven results in and unprofitable results in the combined loss and expense ratio  the common measure of underwriting profitability  was in compared with in and in the surety losses arising from the enron bankruptcy relate to bonds issued to various obligees in connection with enron commitments 
we recognized our maximum surety exposure of million  net of reinsurance  in the fourth quarter of however  certain of these bonds are the subject of litigation 
management believes there are reasonable grounds for challenging the validity of our obligations under the bonds that are the subject of the litigation and intends to pursue the litigation vigorously 
if we are successful in the litigation  any favorable development would be reflected in future operating results 
excluding the effect of the enron surety losses  the combined loss and expense ratio was in  similar to the in the prior year 
the loss ratio  excluding the effect of the enron surety losses  was in compared with in and in catastrophe losses other than those related to the september attack were million in which represented percentage points of the loss ratio compared with million or percentage points in and million or percentage points in catastrophe losses affecting results each year resulted primarily from weather related events in the united states  including in particular tropical storm allison in the second quarter of and hurricane floyd in the third quarter of other than reinsurance recoveries related to the september attack  we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance program during the three year period since there were no other individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded the initial retention 
currently  our initial retention level for each catastrophic event is approximately million in the united states and generally million outside the united states 
our initial retention may increase when our catastrophe reinsurance program is renewed in our expense ratio was in compared with in and in the increase in the expense ratio in was due to overhead expenses growing at a somewhat higher rate than written premiums 
personal insurance net premiums from personal insurance increased in compared with a increase in we continued to grow our personal lines business with the in force policy count for all coverages increasing 
during  our in force policy count increased for automobile  for homeowners and for other coverages 
personal lines premiums outside the united states grew significantly in and  although from a small base 
much of this growth was in europe where remedial actions to increase rates and improve the profitability of this business are in progress 
our personal insurance business produced near breakeven underwriting results in compared with substantial profits in and the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in homeowners results were unprofitable in compared with near breakeven results in and profitable results in results deteriorated significantly in due primarily to a substantial increase in the frequency and severity of water damage claims  including those related to mold  as well as rate deficiencies in several states and inadequate insurance to value 
results deteriorated in compared with due to an increase in large non catastrophe losses that more than offset a decrease in catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in homeowners results were unprofitable in europe in each of the past three years as we are still building the critical mass necessary to absorb the costs of operating that franchise 
our personal automobile business was profitable in each of the last three years 
however  profitability decreased in and again in due to an increase in the frequency of losses in the liability component of this business 
results in each year benefited from stable loss severity 
other personal coverages  which include insurance for personal valuables and excess liability  produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years  as favorable loss experience has continued 
in the latter part of  we had homeowners rate increases approved in many of the states where rates are deficient 
we are seeking a second round of rate increases and are increasing insurance to value 
we saw a dramatic proliferation of water damage claims in  particularly in texas  where state mandated policy language has contributed to broader water damage coverage 
we are closely monitoring the water damage issue in texas and in other states where it is becoming a growing concern 
if necessary  we will reduce our presence in states where we cannot attain rate adequacy due to regulatory constraints or adverse loss trends 
commercial insurance net premiums from commercial insurance increased in compared with a decrease in the decrease in premiums in was the result of the strategy we put in place in late to increase the pricing in these classes and to not renew underperforming business where we could not attain price adequacy 
as a result  retention levels were significantly below historical levels during on the business that was renewed  however  rates increased steadily 
rate increases remained firm in premiums began to increase in as retention levels improved  particularly in the second half of the year 
in addition  new business accelerated in the fourth quarter 
exposure growth  however  was minimal in due to the weak economy 
our commercial insurance business produced underwriting losses in each of the past three years  but has shown substantial improvement in each succeeding year 
the improvement was due in large part to the cumulative effect of the pricing increases and more stringent risk selection in recent years 
the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in commercial insurance results  particularly in the casualty classes  were adversely affected in each of the past three years by incurred losses related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
such losses were million in  million in and million in the higher incurred losses in were the result of adverse trends in asbestos related exposure see loss reserves 
multiple peril results were near breakeven in compared with unprofitable results in and highly unprofitable results in the improvement in was principally in the liability component of this business due to a lower frequency and severity of losses 
the improvement in occurred in both the property and liability components due to a lower frequency of large losses in both the united states and overseas 
results in the property component in also benefited from an absence of catastrophe losses 
conversely  results in were adversely affected by higher catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in and percentage points in there were virtually no catastrophe losses in results for our casualty business improved considerably in compared with the prior two years  but remained unprofitable 
the improvement in was primarily in the automobile component of this business and  to a lesser extent  the primary liability component 
results in were similar with those in  as improvement in the primary liability component was offset by deterioration in the automobile component 
the automobile component was modestly unprofitable in compared with highly unprofitable results in and the significant improvement in was due to higher rates and the culling of loss prone business  which resulted in a lower frequency of losses 
results had deteriorated in due to inadequate prices and an increased frequency of losses 
results for the primary liability component were unprofitable in each of the past three years  but improved in each succeeding year 
the excess liability component was somewhat more unprofitable in compared with the previous two years 
the severity of the large losses that are prevalent in this class has increased in recent years 
excess liability results in each of the past three years benefited from favorable development of prior year loss reserves 
as noted above  casualty results in each of the past three years were adversely affected by incurred losses related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
casualty results outside the united states were near breakeven in compared with unprofitable results in and profitable results in workers compensation results were highly profitable in compared with near breakeven results in and unprofitable results in the improvement each year was due to higher rates as well as a lower frequency of losses  resulting in large part from our disciplined risk selection during the past several years 
property and marine results remained highly unprofitable over the past three years 
the positive effect of the pricing initiative and the culling of unprofitable accounts was offset each year by a high frequency of large property losses 
overseas losses were significantly higher in and results in were adversely affected by higher catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses represented points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with points in and points in specialty insurance reported net premiums from specialty commercial insurance increased by in compared with a increase in excluding the effect of including only six months of executive risk business in  premium growth was about in our strategy of working closely with our customers and our ability to bring new products to market and differentiate such products continue to enable us to renew a considerable percentage of our executive protection and financial institutions business 
however  executive protection premium growth was only in recent claim severity trends indicated the need for higher rates and improved policy terms 
as a result  we initiated a program to increase pricing and to not renew business that no longer meets our underwriting criteria 
the low growth in was due to our writing fewer multi year policies and the non renewal of unprofitable business 
rates increased steadily in  particularly for public company directors and officers liability business 
as a result of the improved pricing  executive protection premiums increased in the fourth quarter of financial institutions had solid premium growth of in due to both new business and higher rates 
expansion of the standard commercial component of this business may be somewhat restrained in by our management of terrorism exposure concentrations 
growth in our other specialty commercial business was primarily from chubb re  our reinsurance business that began operations in premiums produced by chubb re amounted to million in compared with million in and million in we expect reinsurance assumed business to be a significant contributor to growth in our specialty commercial underwriting results were unprofitable in due to the enron surety losses  compared with highly profitable results in and the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in excluding the effect of the enron surety losses  underwriting results were profitable in as evidenced by a combined loss and expense ratio 
executive protection results were profitable in each of the past three years due to favorable development of prior year loss reserves  particularly in the directors and officers and fiduciary liability components 
however  profit margins have narrowed in the most recent accident years 
our employment practices liability business for large employers was unprofitable in each of the past three years 
overseas results were modestly unprofitable in due to several large directors and officers liability losses  compared with highly profitable results in the prior two years 
our financial institutions business was profitable in each of the last three years due to favorable loss experience in the fidelity component of this business 
results from our errors and omissions business were unprofitable in due to an increase in loss severity 
the standard commercial business written on financial institutions produced profitable results in compared with breakeven results in and unprofitable results in results in our other specialty classes were highly unprofitable in due to the enron surety losses 
excluding the enron surety losses  other specialty results were near breakeven in compared with unprofitable results in and profitable results in our reinsurance assumed business generated by chubb re produced a modest underwriting loss in each of the past three years 
aviation results were highly unprofitable in each of these years 
we have reduced our participation in aviation business which will reduce our exposure to any future losses 
surety results were highly profitable in and and  excluding the enron surety losses  were highly profitable in as a result of disarray in the surety reinsurance market caused in large part by the enron bankruptcy  the availability of surety reinsurance in the near term will be significantly reduced 
as a result  our future surety results could be more volatile 
we have in force several gas forward purchase surety bonds similar to those issued to enron 
the total amount of bonds with one principal is million  which far exceeds the combined amount of all other similar surety bonds 
the principals under these surety bonds continue to perform at this time and we have no reason to doubt their continued ability to perform 
loss reserves loss reserves are our property and casualty subsidiaries largest liability 
loss reserves at december  included significant amounts related to the september attack and to our enron surety exposure 
the components of loss reserves were as follows december in millions gross loss reserves total  per balance sheet less related to september attack related to enron surety exposure total  as adjusted reinsurance recoverable total  per balance sheet less related to september attack related to enron surety exposure total  as adjusted net loss reserves total total  as adjusted adjusted to exclude the loss reserves related to the september attack and the enron surety losses  loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by million or in compared with million or in loss reserves for personal insurance and specialty insurance increased in and while loss reserves for commercial insurance decreased each year 
such decrease reflects the significant exposure reductions of the past several years and improved accident year results due to price increases and more stringent risk selection 
during  we experienced overall favorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end 
this compares with favorable development of million in and million in such redundancies were reflected in operating results in these respective years 
each of the past three years benefited from favorable claim experience for certain liability classes  offset in part by losses incurred related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it reflects significant judgmental factors 
this is true because claim settlements to be made in the future will be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions  changing legislative  judicial and social environments and changes in our claim handling procedures 
we use a variety of actuarial methods to estimate loss reserves 
these methods generally utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year for each class of business 
this process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
short tail classes consist principally of homeowners  personal valuables and commercial property business 
for these classes  the estimation of loss reserves is less complex because claims are generally reported and settled quickly and the claims relate to tangible property 
long tail classes include directors and officers liability and other executive protection coverages  commercial excess liability and other liability classes 
most of our loss reserves relate to long tail liability classes of business 
for many liability claims significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
for the long tail liability classes  a relatively small proportion of net losses in the more recent accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
therefore  a relatively large proportion of our net losses for these classes are reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr losses claims that had not yet been reported to us  some of which were not yet known to the insured  and future development on reported claims 
in fact  approximately of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr 
in spite of the inherent imprecision in the loss reserving process  financial reporting requirements dictate that we and other insurance companies report a single amount as the estimate of loss reserves at each balance sheet date 
judicial decisions and legislative actions continue to broaden liability and policy definitions and to increase the severity of claim payments 
as a result of this and other societal and economic developments  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have been exacerbated  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
the uncertainties relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago are exacerbated by inconsistent court decisions and judicial and legislative interpretations of coverage that in some cases have tended to erode the clear and express intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure 
the continued flow of claims has pushed about a dozen manufacturers and users of asbestos products into bankruptcy since to date  approximately companies have filed for bankruptcy as a result of asbestos liability 
in part as a result of these bankruptcies  the volume and value of claims against viable asbestos defendants continue to increase 
our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve traditional defendants who manufactured  distributed or installed asbestos products for whom we wrote excess liability coverages 
while these insureds are relatively few in number  such exposure has increased in recent years due to the increased volume of claims  the erosion of much of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants 
our other asbestos exposures are mostly peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers  distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos as well as premises owners 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  plaintiffs are targeting these peripheral parties with greater frequency and  in many cases  for larger awards 
in addition  the plaintiffs bar continues to solicit new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings 
litigation is then initiated even though many of the claimants do not show any signs of asbestos related illness 
thus  new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued unabated despite the fact that usage of asbestos has declined since the mid s 
based on published projections  we expect that we will continue receiving asbestos claims at the current rate for at least the next several years 
early asbestos claims focused on the major manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products under the products liability section of primary general liability policies  which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s liability 
a growing number of asbestos claims by insureds are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of primary general liability policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits  creating potentially greater exposure 
further  in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage  some insureds that have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products premises or operations claims or attempting to reclassify old products claims 
the extent to which insureds will be successful in obtaining coverage on this basis is uncertain 
the expanded focus of asbestos litigation beyond asbestos manufacturers and distributors to installers and premises owners has created in some instances conflicts among insureds  primary insurers and excess insurers  primarily involving questions regarding allocation of indemnity and expense costs and exhaustion of policy limits 
these issues are generating costly coverage litigation with the potential for inconsistent results 
federal legislation still appears to be the best vehicle for comprehensively addressing the asbestos problem 
any legislative solution would require the support of members of the plaintiffs bar 
significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability related to asbestos related claims due to such factors as the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims as well as the increase in the volume of claims by plaintiffs who claim exposure but who have no symptoms of asbestos related disease and an increase in claims filed under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies 
hazardous waste sites are another significant potential exposure 
under the federal superfund law and similar state statutes  when potentially responsible parties prps fail to handle the clean up at a site  regulators have the work done and then attempt to establish legal liability against the prps 
most prps named to date are parties who have been generators  transporters  past or present land owners or past or present site operators 
the prps disposed of toxic materials at a waste dump site or transported the materials to the site 
in many instances  these prps had proper government authorization 
most sites have multiple prps 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
pollution was not a recognized hazard at the time many of these policies were written 
in more recent years  however  policies specifically exclude such exposures 
as the costs of environmental clean up became substantial  prps and others increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is great uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly depending on a variety of factors 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  and has not been re enacted 
notwithstanding continued pressure by the insurance industry and other interested parties to achieve a legislative solution that would reform the liability provisions of the law  federal legislation appears to be at a standstill 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
without federal movement on superfund reform  the enforcement of superfund liability is shifting to the states 
states are being forced to reconsider state level cleanup statutes and regulations 
as individual states move forward  the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater 
significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
toxic waste losses appear to be developing as expected due to relatively stable claim trends 
in many cases  claims are being settled for less than initially anticipated due to various factors  including more efficient site remediation efforts and increasing success with policy buy backs 
litigation costs remain substantial  particularly for hazardous waste claims 
primary policies provide a limit on indemnity payments but many do not limit defense costs 
this unlimited defense provided in the policies sometimes leads to the payment of defense costs substantially exceeding the indemnity exposure 
a substantial portion of the funds we have expended to date has been for legal fees incurred in the prolonged litigation of coverage issues 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
we have established case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves have been established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
the following table presents loss reserve activity  net of reinsurance recoverable  related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
reinsurance recoveries related to these claims are not significant 
years ended december in millions loss reserves  beginning of year  a incurred losses losses paid a loss reserves  end of year a includes million related to asbestos claims against fibreboard corporation 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims are continually reviewed and updated 
further increases in such loss reserves in and future years are possible as legal and factual issues concerning these claims continue to be clarified 
the amount cannot be reasonably estimated at the present time 
management believes that the aggregate loss reserves of the property and casualty subsidiaries at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
in establishing such reserves  management considers facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
however  given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and the legislatures in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  particularly as they relate to asbestos and toxic waste claims  additional increases in loss reserves may emerge in future periods 
any such increases would have an adverse effect on future operating results 
however  management does not expect that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the corporation s consolidated financial condition or liquidity 
catastrophe exposure the tragic event of september changed the way the property and casualty insurance industry views catastrophic risk 
numerous classes of business have become exposed to terrorism related catastrophic risks in addition to the catastrophic risks related to natural occurrences 
this has required us to change how we identify and evaluate risk accumulations 
we have changed our underwriting protocols to address terrorism and the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance 
however  given the uncertainty of the potential threats  we cannot be sure that we have addressed all the possibilities 
the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries also have exposure to insured losses caused by hurricanes  earthquakes  winter storms  windstorms and other natural catastrophic events 
the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes are unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we continually assess our concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe prone areas globally and develop strategies to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
in recent years  we have invested in modeling technologies and concentration management tools that enable us to better monitor and control catastrophe exposures 
we also continue to explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our potential exposure under insurance policies 
investments and liquidity property and casualty investment income after taxes increased in compared with and in compared with reported growth in was due in part to the inclusion of executive risk investment income for only six months in excluding the effect of the acquisition of executive risk  growth was about in growth in and was due to an increase in invested assets  which reflected substantial cash flow from operations over the period 
growth was dampened by lower available reinvestment rates on fixed maturities that matured in each year 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate increased each year as a result of our holding a somewhat smaller proportion of our investment portfolio in tax exempt securities 
generally  premiums are received by our property and casualty subsidiaries months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
these funds are used first to make current claim and expense payments 
the balance is invested to augment the investment income generated by the existing portfolio 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to the corporation 
new cash available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately million in compared with million in and million in new cash available in and was lower than in due primarily to paid losses growing at a higher rate than premium receipts in these years 
in addition to the cash from operations  the corporation contributed million to the property and casualty subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of  of which million was used to fund the purchase of a interest in allied world assurance holdings  ltd  a newly formed bermuda based insurer 
in  we invested new cash primarily in corporate bonds 
in  we invested new cash primarily in mortgage backed securities 
in  new cash was invested in tax exempt bonds and corporate bonds 
during  we reduced our equity securities portfolio by approximately million with million of the proceeds used to fund the purchase of a interest in hiscox plc  a uk personal and commercial specialty insurer 
in each year  we tried to achieve the appropriate mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
we have evaluated our expected cash needs related to the settlement of claims from the september attack 
we expect to fund our obligations related to such claims from a combination of operating cash flows  maturity of fixed maturity securities and anticipated recovery of reinsurance 
the period over which the payment of claims from the september attack will be made is not yet determinable 
our property and casualty subsidiaries maintain investments in highly liquid  short term and other marketable securities to provide for immediate cash needs 
should the need for additional liquidity develop  the corporation could either sell a portion of its investment portfolio or draw down under its existing commercial paper or bank credit facilities 
corporate and other corporate and other includes investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest expense and other expenses not allocated to the operating subsidiaries  and the results of chubb financial solutions and our real estate and other non insurance subsidiaries 
corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with a loss of million in both and interest expense increased each year due to the inclusion of interest expense on the debt assumed in connection with the executive risk acquisition in july and the issuance of short term and long term debt in in  corporate and other included income of million from a noncompete payment related to the sale of the corporation s interest in associated aviation underwriters  inc aau 
chubb financial solutions chubb financial solutions cfsi was organized by the corporation in to engage in developing and providing risk financing services through the capital and insurance markets 
since its inception  cfsi s non insurance operations have been primarily in the credit derivatives business  principally as a counterparty to credit default swaps 
the corporation guarantees all of these obligations 
income before taxes from the non insurance business of cfsi was million in and million in  which amounts are included in the corporate and other results 
revenues from this business  consisting of earned fees  were million and million in and  respectively 
in a typical credit default swap  cfsi participates in the senior or super senior layer of a structure designed to replicate the performance of a portfolio of securities  loans or other debt obligations 
the structure of these credit default swaps generally requires cfsi to make payment to counterparties to the extent cumulative losses  related to numerous credit events  exceed a specified attachment point 
credit default swaps are derivatives and are carried at estimated fair value in the financial statements 
changes in fair value are included in income in the period of the change 
valuation models are used to estimate the fair value of our obligation in each credit default swap 
such valuations require considerable judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
the fair value of our credit default swaps is subject to fluctuations arising from  among other factors  observable changes in credit spreads and interest rates 
increases in the fair value of obligations  which would result in a charge to income  could be material upon the occurrence of an extreme  widespread or persistent economic event that suggests an actual loss is possible 
the market risks associated with our obligations under credit default swaps are discussed under market risk credit derivatives 
the insurance and reinsurance solutions that cfsi develops to meet the risk management needs of its customers are written by our property and casualty subsidiaries 
results from this business are included within our insurance results 
a property and casualty subsidiary issued a reinsurance contract to an insurer that provides financial guarantees on asset backed transactions 
at december   the amount of aggregate principal commitments related to the contract was approximately million  all of which expire by real estate real estate operations resulted in a loss before taxes of million in each of the past three years  which amounts are included in the corporate and other results 
in each year  we sold selected commercial properties as well as residential properties 
real estate revenues were million in  million in and million in we own approximately million of land that we expect will be developed in the future 
in addition  we own approximately million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease 
we are continuing to explore the sale of certain of our remaining properties 
loans receivable  which amounted to million at december   are primarily purchase money mortgages 
such loans  which were issued in connection with our joint venture activities and other property sales  are generally collateralized by buildings and  in some cases  land 
we continually evaluate the ultimate collectibility of such loans and establish appropriate reserves 
the recoverability of the carrying value of our real estate assets is assessed based on our ability to fully recover costs through a future revenue stream 
the assumptions used reflect a continued improvement in demand for office space  an increase in rental rates and the ability and intent to obtain financing in order to hold and develop such remaining properties and protect our interests over the long term 
management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets 
however  if the assets are not sold or developed as presently contemplated  it is possible that additional impairment losses may be recognized 
investment gains and losses net investment gains realized by the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries were as follows years ended december in millions equity securities fixed maturities sale of aau realized investment gains before tax realized investment gains after tax decisions to sell securities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
thus  realized investment gains and losses on the sale of investments may vary significantly from year to year 
we periodically review the value of our invested assets for other than temporary impairment 
if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is deemed to be other than temporary  the difference between cost and estimated fair value is charged to income as a realized investment loss 
in  realized gains on sales of equity securities and fixed maturities of million and million  respectively  were substantially offset by writedowns due to the recognition of other than temporary impairment on certain securities 
sales of equity securities in resulted in net realized investment gains due primarily to the significant appreciation in united states equity markets 
a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
fixed maturity securities which the corporation and its insurance subsidiaries have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
the remaining fixed maturities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  are classified as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost  while fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at market value 
at december   of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as held to maturity compared with at december  and at december  the unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments carried at market value  which includes equity securities and fixed maturities classified as available for sale  is reflected in a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income tax 
the unrealized market appreciation before tax of those fixed maturities carried at amortized cost was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation was not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in unrealized market appreciation or depreciation of fixed maturities were due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates 
market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio  which exposes the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries to risks related to interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we also have exposure to market risks through our credit derivatives business and our debt obligations 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
investments the main objectives in managing the investment portfolios of the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a security that promises a fixed return to changes in interest rates 
changes in market interest rates directly affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration  which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries 
the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions tax exempt average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities average interest rate mortgage backed securities average interest rate total at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in m illions tax exempt average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities average interest rate mortgage backed securities average interest rate total the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
as a result  we believe that we have minimal credit quality risk 
taxable bonds in our domestic portfolio comprise us treasury  government agency  mortgage backed and corporate securities 
approximately of our taxable bonds are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or rated aa or better by moody s or standard and poor s 
of the tax exempt bonds  more than are rated aa or better  with more than rated aaa 
less than of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
our taxable bonds have an average maturity of six years  while our tax exempt bonds mature on average in eight years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly and invest primarily in those classes of mortgage backed securities that are less subject to prepayment risk 
mortgage backed securities comprised and of our taxable bond portfolio at year end and  respectively 
about of our mortgage backed securities holdings at december  related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass through securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and aaa rated non agency cmos backed by government agency collateral or by single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets and market value information is readily available from broker dealers 
an additional of our mortgage backed securities were call protected aaa rated commercial securities 
the remaining mortgage backed holdings were all in investment grade commercial mortgage backed securities 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the market value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since their business is transacted primarily in such local currency 
we reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which our property and casualty subsidiaries have loss reserves and other liabilities 
such investments have characteristics similar to our liabilities in those currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held non us investments of billion supporting their international operations 
these investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the euro  the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling 
the following table provides information about those fixed maturity investments that are denominated in these currencies 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts in us dollar equivalents by expected maturity dates at december  and actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions euro canadian dollar british pound sterling at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions euro canadian dollar british pound sterling equity price risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of equity securities 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  equity returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
our publicly traded equity securities are high quality  diversified across industries and readily marketable 
our portfolio also includes alternative investments  primarily investment partnerships 
these investments by their nature are less liquid than our other investments 
we actively manage our risk by allocating a comparatively small amount of funds to alternative investments  perform extensive research prior to investing in a new investment and monitor the performance of the entities in which we have invested 
a hypothetical decrease of in the market price of each of the equity securities held at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio 
credit derivatives cfsi s obligations with respect to its credit derivatives business are carried at estimated fair value 
the fair value of our credit default swaps is subject to fluctuations arising from  among other factors  changes in credit spreads and interest rates 
at december   the fair value of future obligations under cfsi s credit derivatives business was approximately million  which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
for any particular credit default swap  an increase in the estimated fair value of our obligation may occur as a result of changing market conditions even when the probability of an actual loss to cfsi remains unlikely 
the occurrence of an extreme  widespread or persistent economic event that suggests an actual loss is possible could result in a material increase in the fair value of our obligations 
we review credit default swaps using quantitative analysis 
when we enter into a credit default swap  we believe the credit quality in most instances is at least equal to the upper end of the investment grade credit spectrum 
at december   cfsi s aggregate exposure or retained risk  referred to as notional amounts  from its open credit default swaps was approximately billion 
the notional amounts are used to express the extent of involvement in swap transactions 
the notional amounts are not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and are not recorded on the balance sheet 
these amounts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual cash flows and are not necessarily representative of the potential for gain or loss 
since our position is senior to other subordinated interests and exposure to a single default within a referenced portfolio is limited  the severity of loss from our credit default swaps is likely to be lower than that of a similarly rated debt security portfolio valued at billion 
debt we also have interest rate risk on our debt obligations 
the table on page provides information about our long term debt obligations and related interest rate swap at december  for debt obligations  the table presents expected cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date 
for the interest rate swap  the table presents the notional amount and related interest rates by maturity date

in june  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares 
the authorization has no expiration while the authorization will expire on june  as of december    shares remained under the share repurchase authorization and  shares remained under the authorization 
in the aggregate  the corporation repurchased  shares in open market transactions in at a cost of million   shares in at a cost of million and  shares in at a cost of million 
the corporation s financial strength provides the capacity and flexibility to raise funds in the capital markets 
the corporation filed a shelf registration statement in december when it is declared effective by the securities and exchange commission  up to billion of various types of securities may be issued by the corporation 
in november  the corporation sold million of unsecured notes due in and million of unsecured debentures due in under a previously filed shelf registration 
the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
the corporation also has outstanding million of unsecured notes due in and million of unsecured debentures due in chubb capital corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary  has outstanding million of unsecured notes due in the chubb capital notes are guaranteed by the corporation 
the long term debt obligations of executive risk remained in place subsequent to its acquisition in chubb executive risk inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation  has outstanding million of unsecured notes due in executive risk capital trust  wholly owned by chubb executive risk  has outstanding million of capital securities 
the sole assets of the trust are debentures issued by chubb executive risk 
the capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption in upon repayment of the debentures 
the capital securities are also subject to mandatory redemption under certain circumstances beginning in the corporation has guaranteed the unsecured notes and the capital securities 
in august  the corporation entered into a cancelable interest rate swap in order to monetize the value of the call option embedded in the million capital securities 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  the corporation receives and pays the counterparty the month libor rate plus basis points 
as a result of entering into the swap  interest costs related to this portion of our debt will float with short term interest rates 
the corporation has two credit agreements with a group of banks that provide for unsecured borrowings of up to million in the aggregate 
the million short term revolving credit facility  which was to have terminated on july   was extended to july  the million medium term revolving credit facility terminates on july  on the respective termination dates  any loans then outstanding become payable 
there have been no borrowings under these agreements 
management anticipates that similar credit agreements will replace these agreements 
these facilities are available for general corporate purposes and to support the corporation s commercial paper borrowing arrangement 
change in accounting principles in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the statement addresses how intangible assets should be accounted for upon their acquisition and how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
under sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for the corporation for the year beginning january  the statement will be applied to goodwill recognized in the corporation s financial statements at that date 
sfas no 
may not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
the elimination of goodwill amortization is expected to result in an increase in net income in of approximately million 
the corporation is in the process of assessing the effect  if any  that the implementation of the other provisions of sfas no 
will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations
