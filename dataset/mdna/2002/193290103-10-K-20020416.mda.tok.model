the company has two reportable segments cole vision  which accounted for of total revenue in fiscal  and things remembered  which accounted for of total revenue in fiscal most of cole vision s revenue represents sales of prescription eyewear  accessories and services through its cole licensed brands and pearle retail locations

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in net revenue for fiscal was attributable to increases in consolidated comparable store sales  the target optical expansion  growth in managed vision care revenue and increases in direct channel revenues both catalog and internet at things remembered 
these increases were partially offset by one less week of revenue in fiscal the rd week in fiscal provided approximately million in revenue 
at cole licensed brands  the comparable store sales increased by primarily reflecting an increase in the average spectacle selling price 
at pearle company owned stores  the comparable store sales increased reflecting an increase in average transaction selling price for the first nine months and an increase in the number of transactions for the fourth quarter 
the increase in average transaction selling price was due  in part  to not repeating a off frame promotion that ran during the entire first quarter of fiscal at things remembered  the comparable store sales decline was attributable to the general slowdown in mall traffic which worsened following the events of september and from not repeating february s aggressive merchandise clearance promotion 
however  the average transaction selling price increased as a result of sales of new merchandise at higher average unit retails  more personalization and less promotion 
the gross margin dollar increase in fiscal resulted from increased net revenue at cole vision and improvements in gross margin rate at things remembered 
the gross margin rate at cole vision was flat compared to the prior year  inclusive of a percentage point decline in the second half of fiscal primarily because more customers selected merchandise from cole licensed brand s new  higher cost frame assortment at sears 
higher revenue from managed vision care partially offset the impact of the decline in frame margins in fiscal the offset equaled of the gross margin rate 
at things remembered  the gross margin rate improved percentage points compared to the prior year  reflecting the improvement in average selling price and less inventory shrinkage 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue were essentially even with fiscal the dollar increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher store payroll  store occupancy and other store costs incurred to support the increases in revenues and the target optical expansion 
the company opened new target optical stores during fiscal operating margin improvements from nonstore overhead expenses and reduced advertising expenditures were offset by the negative operating margin impact of fixed payroll and occupancy costs due to lower sales volume following september in fiscal  operating expenses also included a million first quarter severance charge in connection with a personnel reduction at cole vision 
in fiscal  the company s operating income improved while maintaining leverage despite one less week of sales  the absorption of increased losses from the continued expansion of target optical and the third quarter decrease in operating expense leverage attributable to the modest growth in net revenues following september the losses associated with the target optical expansion are expected to decline as older stores ramp up to profitability  as a result of the new focus on opening only in super target stores and with a switch from fixed to percentage rent 
the average time to store level profitability is also expected to reduce 
interest and other income expense  net  decreased million in fiscal contributing factors included one less week of interest expense  no seasonal borrowing during fiscal and higher interest income from increased temporary cash investments  higher interest and equity income from pearle europe and a million gain from the sale of a dallas office facility no longer needed for pearle s operations 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective rates are significantly above the statutory rate because of the impact of nondeductible goodwill and unearned compensation 
the decrease in the rate for fiscal versus fiscal was primarily a result of the increase in pretax income and increased equity income from pearle europe  for which no us income tax is provided 
a more complete discussion of income taxes is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in net revenue for fiscal was primarily attributable to increases in consolidated comparable store sales  the rd week  revenue associated with the metlife vision care business acquired in october and the target optical expansion 
these increases were partially offset by the closing of poor performing stores at pearle and things remembered and the closing of optical departments at montgomery ward in december see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the closing of the montgomery ward departments 
at cole licensed brands and pearle company owned stores  the comparable store sales increases primarily reflected increases in the average selling price 
the number of transactions at cole licensed brands was even with last 
table of contents year 
at pearle company owned stores  the average transaction increase was partially offset by a decrease in the number of transactions during the first half of the year 
at things remembered  the comparable store sales increase reflected an increase in sales of new merchandise at higher average unit retails 
the gross margin dollar increase was attributable to the revenue increase at pearle and things remembered  the additional revenue associated with the metlife vision care business and an improvement in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue 
the improvement in the gross margin rate was primarily the result of higher average selling prices in the optical businesses 
other factors in the improvement were additional metlife vision care revenues  resolution of problems experienced during s integration of new manufacturing and merchandise inventory management systems at pearle and s inventory write off due to the closing of the ward optical departments 
at cole vision  the gross margin rate improved percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal the gross margin rate at things remembered decreased percentage points to fiscal reflecting the impact of an aggressive merchandise clearance promotion in the first quarter of fiscal the fiscal operating expense increase was due primarily to increases in staffing for improved service levels in the optical businesses  increases in expenses associated with the rd week and the target optical expansion  increases in managed vision care costs primarily associated with the metlife vision care business and increases in incentive bonus expense due to improved performance at cole vision 
these increases were partially offset by million of severance costs in fiscal for the company s former president and several other executives 
as a percentage of net revenue  operating expenses lost leverage in fiscal because payroll costs increased percentage points compared to a year ago for the reasons discussed above 
a decline in comparable store sales at pearle company owned stores during the first six months of fiscal and a million first quarter charge for severance costs recorded in connection with a personnel reduction at cole vision also impacted the comparison 
operating income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting improved operating results at both cole vision and things remembered 
the operating income at cole vision improved despite absorbing increased losses associated with the target optical start up and store opening program 
interest and other income expense  net  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal because of increased interest expense from the rd week  seasonal borrowing  less income from reduced temporary cash investments and lower equity income from pearle europe 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the rates reflect the significant impact of nondeductible goodwill and unearned compensation in both years and lower equity income from pearle europe in fiscal for which no us income tax is provided 
liquidity and capital resources cole national corporation s primary source of liquidity is funds provided from operations of its operating subsidiaries 
in addition  its wholly owned subsidiary  cole national group  inc and its operating subsidiaries have a working capital line of credit ranging from million to million based on cole national group s current debt leverage ratio as described in the credit facility 
as of year end  the total commitment was million and availability under the credit facility totaled million  after reduction for commitments under outstanding letters of credit 
there were no working capital borrowings outstanding as of february  or at any time during fiscal the maximum amount outstanding during fiscal was million and the daily average borrowing during fiscal was million

the indentures permit dividend payments to cole national corporation equal to one half of cole national group s consolidated net income  provided that no default or event of default has occurred under the indentures and that cole national group has met a specified fixed charge coverage ratio test 
the indentures also permit payments to cole national corporation for certain tax obligations and for administrative expenses not to exceed of net sales

the company may from time to time purchase its outstanding notes in the open market or refinance them depending on capital market conditions 
no significant principal payment obligations are due under cole national s outstanding indebtedness until  when a million principal payment is due under a promissory note 
the ability of cole national corporation and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations will be primarily dependent upon future financial and operating performance of the subsidiaries and upon cole national s ability to renew or refinance borrowings or to raise additional capital through equity financing or sales of assets 
in november  the board of directors authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to million shares of common stock  or approximately of cole national corporation s outstanding shares  through open market or block transactions

as of february   cole national corporation had purchased a total of  shares of common stock  and has authority to purchase up to  shares of common stock in the open market or through block purchases 
no shares were purchased during fiscal and fiscal cash balances at year end were million compared to million at february  operations generated net cash of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary source of the million improvement in cash provided from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was an improvement in working capital 
a reduction in inventories at cole vision and things remembered during fiscal provided improved cash flows of million compared to fiscal changes in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets and liabilities provided improved cash flows of million 
most of the remaining improvement resulted from increased operating income before depreciation and amortization and lower interest and other income expense  net 
the primary source of the million improvement in cash provided from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was a change in working capital 
in fiscal  the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities used million more cash than in fiscal in fiscal  increases in prepaid expenses and inventories used million and million more cash  respectively  than in fiscal the increase in prepaid expenses in fiscal was due to the fact that the fiscal year ended after february when the minimum rent payments were made 
the increase in inventories in fiscal was attributable to the remerchandising of pearle and the expansion of target optical

table of contents for fiscal  management plans to expand the number of stores including the opening of approximately target optical stores  and to remodel and relocate other stores 
in fiscal  the company will open only in new super target stores 
super target stores will offer target optical excellent  highly visible locations and high traffic 
as a result  the company s emphasis at target optical is moving from opening stores to improving their operations 
management currently estimates that capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million  excluding acquisitions and systems development costs 
approximately million is estimated to be incurred for systems development costs in  which will be capitalized and subsequently amortized 
cole national corporation believes that funds provided from operations including cash on hand along with funds available under the credit facility will provide adequate sources of liquidity to allow its operating subsidiaries to continue to expand the number of stores and to fund capital expenditures and systems development costs 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company leases a substantial portion of its equipment and facilities including laboratories  office and warehouse space  and retail store locations

significant accounting policies management relies on the use of estimates and makes assumptions that impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
these estimates are based on historical results and trends as well as our forecasts as to how these might change in the future 
a more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
some of the most critical accounting policies that might materially impact the company s results include allowance for doubtful accounts most of the company s accounts and notes receivable are due from licensed brands host stores  managed vision care accounts and pearle franchisees 
estimates are used in determining the company s allowance for bad debts and are based on historical experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of accounts receivable by aging category 

table of contents reserve for excess and obsolete inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated reserve is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
factors considered include inventory age  condition and whether reorder of the product has been or is about to be discontinued 
valuation of systems development costs and software systems development costs and software are amortized over the useful life of the software 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period the software will be in service 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the software s future usefulness has been adversely impacted 
valuation of long lived assets property and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent goodwill and tradenames become impaired 
a discussion of the fiscal impact of a change in accounting required by the financial accounting standards board fasb that will affect the company s accounting for goodwill and tradenames is included in new accounting pronouncements below 
valuation of deferred income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
management regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance for tax assets based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
in determining the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets  management estimates taxable income into the future 
future taxable income could be materially different from amounts estimated  in which case the valuation allowance and future net income would need to be adjusted 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
this statement requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized  but instead  will be subject to annual reviews for impairment 
the company will apply these rules in accounting for its goodwill and tradenames beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the company is in the process of quantifying the impact of adopting each of the provisions of sfas amortization of goodwill and tradenames totaled million in fiscal a substantial portion of the goodwill amortization is nondeductible for tax purposes 
upon adoption of sfas  the company expects to stop amortizing goodwill and tradenames which would have the effect of increasing net income and reducing the company s annual effective tax rate 
the fasb has also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas and no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for business combinations by  among other things  prohibiting the use of the pooling of interests method 
sfas provides guidance for legal obligations arising from the retirement of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
none of these standards is expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or operations 
forward looking information the company s management expects its continued emphasis on becoming better retailers to have an ongoing positive impact on the company s results in fiscal  enabling the company to continue the earnings turnaround that began with the fourth quarter management estimates that net income could increase approximately to in fiscal from fiscal with fiscal adjusted for the pro forma impacts of sfas and fiscal s estimated annual effective tax rate of 
achieving these results assumes  among other things  that the current economic environment does not worsen 
certain sections of this annual report on form k  including this management s discussion and analysis  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation act of actual results may 
table of contents differ materially from those forecast due to a variety of factors that can adversely affect operating results  liquidity and financial condition  such as risks associated with the timing and achievement of improvements in the operations of the optical business  the nature and extent of disruptions of the economy from terrorist activities and from governmental and consumer responses to such acts  the success of new store openings and the rate at which new stores achieve profitability  the company s relationships with host stores and franchisees  the company s ability to select  stock and price merchandise attractive to customers  success of systems development and integration  competition and regulation in the optical industry  integration of acquired businesses  economic  political and weather factors affecting consumer spending  operating factors affecting customer satisfaction  including manufacturing quality of optical and engraved goods  the mix of goods sold  pricing and other competitive factors  the seasonality of the company s business and the actual effect of implementation of new accounting standards 
forward looking statements are made based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company 
all forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainty 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
foreign exchange risk arises from the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because the company s reporting currency is the united states dollar 
management seeks to minimize the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through natural internal offsets to the fullest extent possible
