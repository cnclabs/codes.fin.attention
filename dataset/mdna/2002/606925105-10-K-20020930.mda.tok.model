overview mobius is a leading provider of integrated solutions for total content management 
for over two decades  mobius has delivered innovative technology that provides for storage and access to mission critical documents  reports and images 
mobius solutions have achieved industry wide recognition for their ability to support high volume  high performance  simultaneous access requirements in distributed environments that range from the desktop to the mainframe 
mobius packaged software products support a broad range of content intensive e business requirements  including customer relationship management  enterprise resource planning  internet presentment and payment  imaging and workflow 
the company s total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal mobius derives its revenues from product licenses  related annual maintenance and professional services and other 
this year  of total revenues were generated from software licenses  were generated from maintenance and were generated from professional services and other 
mobius believes that the decrease in license revenue was impacted by the recent global economic recession and the disappointing response of its customers to sales and marketing initiatives 
the decrease in license revenue has been partially offset by an increase in professional service and other revenue 
in an effort to improve its sales and marketing initiatives  the company has refocused its sales and marketing team under new leadership and implemented new productivity strategies 
license revenues of viewdirect and documentdirect products have historically accounted for a majority of the company s license revenues and for a significant portion of total revenues 
this year license revenues for these products accounted for approximately of license revenues and approximately of total revenues 
last year license revenues for these products accounted for approximately of license revenues and approximately of total revenues 
the company anticipates that  for the foreseeable future  license revenue from these products will continue to account for a significant portion of license and total revenues 
mobius growing customer base has led to continued growth in maintenance revenues  from million in fiscal to million last year to million this year 
maintenance revenue consists primarily of fees for customer support services and enhancements provided by the company for its products 
this year  mobius dedicated more resources to the development of the company s professional service business and entered into more professional service arrangements 
as a result  professional service and other revenue has increased from million in fiscal and million last year to million this year 
other revenues in all years were not significant 
international revenues decreased this year to million from million last year 
international revenues were million in fiscal mobius believes that the economic recession and the disappointing response of its customers to sales and marketing initiatives contributed to mobius selling fewer licenses of its products to new and existing international customers 
as a group  the company s international subsidiaries have been unprofitable to date  and mobius expects achieving profitability will continue to require significant management attention  increased revenues and financial resources 
the majority of mobius current international revenues are derived from the operations of its wholly owned subsidiaries and through agents 
the company receives a royalty that is a percent of agent or subsidiary sales of software licenses and maintenance contracts to international customers 
the company s subsidiaries conduct business in the currency of the country in which they operate  exposing mobius to currency fluctuations and currency transaction losses or gains  which are outside of mobius control 
prior to fiscal  losses at mobius international subsidiaries had not been consolidated for united states income tax purposes 
consequently  prior to fiscal  the company has experienced a reduced effective tax benefit versus the us federal statutory rate  as no tax benefit had been provided for the majority of international losses 
during fiscal  the company made certain us federal income tax elections which allowed certain of these international tax losses to be included within its us federal consolidated income tax return 
these elections  in part  have caused the company s effective tax rate to approach the us federal statutory rate in fiscal to the extent the company is successful at bringing its international subsidiaries to profitability  the company s effective tax rate could again exceed the us federal statutory rate depending on the availability of operating loss carryforwards in the profitable international jurisdictions and the operation of foreign tax credit limitations 
critical accounting policies and estimates mobius discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon mobius consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are evaluated on an on going basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that its significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are influenced by the following critical accounting policies  among others 
revenue recognition license and maintenance revenue are recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
revenue from software license contracts includes license fees related to long term licenses  generally or years  and fees for term license contracts  which are generally to years 
revenue from executed software license contracts is recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer if no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
software license revenue includes the present value of future payments under non cancelable license arrangements which provide for payment in installments generally over periods from to years 
a portion of the discount is recognized as interest income over the term of the arrangement 
sop generally requires revenue earned on multiple element software arrangements  such as additional software products  upgrades or enhancements  rights to exchange or return software  maintenance or services  including elements deliverable only on a when and if available basis  to be allocated to the various elements of such sale based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair values allocable to each such element 
if sufficient vendor specific objective evidence of fair market values does not exist  revenue from the sale is deferred until such sufficient evidence exists  or until all elements have satisfied the requirements for revenue recognition 
sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  which amended sop and clarified what is considered vendor specific evidence of fair value for the various elements in a multiple element arrangement  was adopted by mobius on july  according to these guidelines  when the company sells a software license contract that includes maintenance  the maintenance revenue is typically unbundled from the initial license fee and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  starting from the inception of the software license agreement 
the unearned portion of such maintenance revenue is classified as deferred revenue with amounts extending beyond one year reported as non current 
revenue on maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance contract  generally twelve months 
the unearned portion of maintenance revenue is classified as deferred revenue 
software development costs statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  requires the capitalization of certain software development costs once technological feasibility is established 
the capitalized costs are then amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated product life  or on the ratio of current revenues to total projected product revenues  whichever is greater 
the company determines technological feasibility based on the working model method 
the period between establishment of a working model and the general availability of its software has historically been short and  accordingly  software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant 
as a result  the company has expensed all software development costs 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and tax credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized

the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future

license revenues typically peak during the fourth fiscal quarter and to a lesser extent in the second fiscal quarter

bad debt reserves accounts receivable reserves are primarily calculated by identifying potentially problem accounts and potential adjustments to maintenance agreements 
mobius also has a small reserve to absorb losses based upon historical experience that may result from current receivables

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk mobius investment portfolio is subject to interest rate sensitivity 
the primary objective of mobius investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing the interest income  without significantly increasing risk 
some of the marketable securities that mobius has invested in may be subject to market rate interest risk 
this means a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the security to fluctuate 
for example  if mobius holds a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rates and the prevailing interest rates later rise  the market value of the security will probably decline 
at june   mobius primarily held debt securities 
mobius may be subject to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to accounts receivable and accounts payable that may be denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency in certain international jurisdictions 
to the extent that such foreign currency transactions are negatively or positively effected by foreign currency fluctuations  foreign currency transaction losses or gains would be recognized 
mobius does not use derivative foreign exchange financial investments
