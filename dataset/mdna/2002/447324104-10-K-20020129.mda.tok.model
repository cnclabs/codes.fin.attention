results of operations the following table presents  for the fiscal years indicated  selected items from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of worldwide sales and service fees and the year to year percentage changes in the dollar amounts of those items 
percentage of revenues year to year change increase decrease vs 
vs 
sales and service fees gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss n 
a license fee income  net interest expense net income loss loss fiscal compared with fiscal net loss for the fiscal year ended october  was million  or 
per share  on a diluted basis  compared to net income of million  or 
per share  reported for the preceding year 
the change in our year to year results was due primarily to a significant decline in license fee income in fiscal from that reported in fiscal  and to a lesser extent  to a decrease in sales 
sales and service fees were million  for fiscal  a decrease of from the million reported for fiscal the decline in sales was due in major part to the adverse effects of a stronger us dollar when translating foreign sales for financial reporting purposes  and by a decrease in domestic sales 
when measured at constant exchange rates  sales for fiscal would have been essentially the same as domestic sales in fiscal declined by million  or  as a result of a slowing economy in most industrial sectors that began near the end of the first fiscal quarter  while sales in europe increased million in spite of the strong dollar 
sales in southeast asia declined by million  or  due to weak economic conditions in that area during fiscal net sales of computerized machine tool systems increased in fiscal by million compared to the prior year when measured in constant dollars but was offset by a million decline in sales of stand alone control systems 
net sales of computerized machine systems in the us declined for the full fiscal year in contrast  sales of computerized machine systems in europe  measured in constant dollars  increased for the full year 
parts and service fee revenues declined by million  or 
the decrease was exclusively in the united states and further reflects the weakening economic environment 
international sales  including export sales from the united states  approximated of consolidated sales and service fees for fiscal compared to for fiscal new order bookings for fiscal were million  compared to million for the prior year period  a decrease of 
orders were million in the first quarter of fiscal but declined to million  and million second  third and fourth quarter  respectively 
the decline in orders from the first quarter is the result of weak economic conditions in most industrial market sectors in the us along with a softening in the german economy 
the decline in orders was most pronounced in the united states where computerized machine system orders declined in dollars 
this was partially offset by a increase in computerized machine system orders in europe  measured in constant dollars 
we have experienced a further decline in orders in the first quarter of fiscal reflecting the recessionary environment in our primary markets 
backlog was million at october   compared to million at october  gross profit margin declined in fiscal to from in fiscal  due primarily to the unfavorable effects of the stronger us dollar 
operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to increased costs for enhanced product development activities associated with our next generation computer control technology 
the increased operating expense for the full fiscal year combined with reduced sales and gross profit margins  resulted in an operating loss of  for fiscal as compared to an operating profit of million in the prior year 
restructuring expense of  in fiscal included a reversal of  primarily related to sub letting space in a leased facility that was reserved as part of a previous restructuring plan 
in addition  a restructuring charge of  was recorded for severance costs related reductions in our domestic operations 
in fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of  for severance costs related to the termination of employees at our farmington hills facility in connection with the consolidation of this operation into our north american sales and service business 
license fee income and litigation settlement fees in fiscal consisted of several licenses that were granted during the year  while the substantial license fees reported in fiscal were primarily the result of the settlement of a long standing patent infringement claim 
the licensing program that resulted in the license and litigation settlement fees has effectively been completed and we do not expect significant license fees in fiscal other expense in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal and consisted primarily of typhoon related flood damage at our manufacturing facility in taiwan of which our insurers have denied coverage 
fiscal other expense consisted primarily of realized and unrealized currency losses associated with accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies  primarily those linked to the euro  which for the most part  were not hedged during fiscal in fiscal  these accounts receivable were fully hedged 
the provision for foreign income tax in both fiscal and fiscal consists mostly of income tax expense related to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
fiscal compared with fiscal net income for the fiscal year ended october  was million  or 
per share  on a diluted basis  compared to million  or 
per share  for the preceding year 
fiscal net income was due almost entirely to the receipt in the fourth quarter of proceeds from a settlement of a long standing patent infringement claim 
operating results for fiscal  however  compared unfavorably to those for the prior year  due to the substantial adverse impact of converting foreign sales and costs  particularly those denominated in euros  to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
had exchange rates in fiscal remained the same as the average rate in effect during fiscal  income before taxes for fiscal would have increased by approximately million 
sales and service fees were million for fiscal  an increase of from the million reported for fiscal at constant exchange rates net sales and service fees would have been approximately million for the fiscal year  an increase of compared to the prior year 
the increase in sales and service fees was primarily driven by an increase in sales of computerized machine systems 
sales of computerized machine systems totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
domestic sales of computerized machine systems in fiscal increased by million  or  due primarily to a increase in units shipped 
shipments of computerized machine systems in europe also increased by 
shipments of computerized machine systems in southeast asia also benefited from significantly improved market conditions 
international sales  including export sales from the united states  approximated of consolidated sales and service fees for fiscal compared to for fiscal new order bookings for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
orders for computerized machine systems increased million reflecting a increase in unit orders 
unit orders for machine systems in the us increased over fiscal as a result of a very strong fourth quarter  which reflected favorable acceptance of our new products introduced at the biennial international manufacturing technology show imts in september  along with improved market conditions 
outside of the united states  orders for machine systems increased due principally to increased market penetration in continental europe and southeast asia 
orders in southeast asia also benefited from significantly improved market conditions 
backlog was million at october   compared to million at the end of fiscal gross profit margin  as a percentage of sales  declined in fiscal to from in fiscal  due primarily to the unfavorable effects of the stronger us dollar particularly in relationship to the euro 
the unfavorable effect was most pronounced in the fourth fiscal quarter 
operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to product development costs associated with the our new line of computerized machine systems as well as costs associated with expanded sales and marketing activities 
the increased operating expenses  combined with the adverse margin impact of the strong us dollar  resulted in a decrease in operating profit from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of  for severance costs related to the termination of employees at our subsidiary  autocon technologies  inc in connection with the completion of the consolidation of this operation into our north american sales and service business 
fourteen employees received notice that their position would be eliminated in fiscal interest expense for fiscal declined by  or  from the level in fiscal  primarily due to the significant reduction in our outstanding borrowings 
other expense was  in fiscal compared to other income of  in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of realized and unrealized currency losses associated with accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies  primarily those linked to the euro  which for the most part  were not hedged during fiscal the provision for income taxes of  in fiscal is primarily related to the earnings of a foreign subsidiary as well as to the settlement of a previously disclosed german tax issue for approximately  domestic net operating loss carryforwards were substantially utilized in fiscal we would have recorded an additional tax provision of approximately million in fiscal without the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains more information with respect to our net operating loss carryforwards 
euro currency many of the countries in which we sell our products and services are member states of the economic and monetary union emu 
beginning january   member states of the emu were permitted to begin trading in either their local currencies or the euro  the official currency of emu participating member states 
effective january   the euro replaced the national currencies of the participating member states 
we have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any material adverse effects on our operations related to the euro 
foreign currency risk management we manage our foreign currency exposure through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts periodically to hedge certain forecasted inter company sales and forecasted inter company and third party purchases denominated in foreign currencies primarily the pound sterling  euro and new taiwan dollar 
we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
we also moderate our currency risk related to significant purchase commitments with certain foreign vendors through price adjustment agreements that provide for a sharing of  or otherwise limit  the risk of currency fluctuations on the costs of purchased products 
note to the consolidated financial statements has more information on this subject 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at october  cash used for operations totaled million in fiscal  compared to cash provided by operations of million in fiscal cash flow from operations in fiscal was enhanced by license fee receipts of approximately million  net of related legal fees and expenses 
working capital  excluding short term debt  was million at october   compared to million at october  the increase in working capital is attributable to an increase in inventory of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable 
the increase in inventory related primarily to increased units of finished product available for sale  because shipments during the year to customers in the us and southeast asia markets were below planned levels 
we have adjusted our production schedules  which began to take effect in the fourth fiscal quarter of accordingly  we expect a reduction in inventory and operating working capital during fiscal capital investments during the year consisted of expenditures for software development projects and purchases of equipment 
investments also included  for a secured loan to a software company as more fully described in note during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
we funded these expenditures and our other cash needs with borrowings under our bank credit facility 
effective october   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  maturing december  the restated credit agreement provides for increased interest rates during the second half of fiscal of one to one and one half percentage points more than those called for by the prior credit agreement  as well as a facility fee of up to  if we have not reduced the commitment by million at may  or replaced the facility by august  the restated credit agreement provides the bank lender with a security interest in substantially all of our domestic assets and of the common stock of our us holding companies which own our foreign subsidiaries 
also  as discussed in note  we are in discussion with other lenders for long term replacement credit facilities  and while we believe that we will be able to obtain replacement facilities in fiscal under acceptable terms  no such assurance can be given 
the financial covenants included in the restated credit agreement require us to maintain a specified working capital base  meet quarterly net worth and ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization requirements and impose a maximum leverage ratio and restrict our capital expenditures 
total debt at october  was million  representing of total capitalization  compared to million  or of total capitalization  at october  we were in compliance with all loan covenants  and had an additional credit availability of million at october  based on our business plan for fiscal  which include planned reductions of operating expenses and working capital  we believe that cash flow generated from operations and borrowings available to us under our restated credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements in fiscal although  we believe that the assumptions underlying our business plan are reasonable there are risks related to further declines in market demand and reduced sales in the us and europe  adverse currency movements  realization of anticipated cost reductions and cash realized from planned inventory reductions  that could cause our actual results to differ from our business plan 
during the first quarter of fiscal  order rates have deteriorated further  both in the us and europe 
should these below plan order rates continue into our second fiscal quarter  we are prepared to take additional cost cutting actions 
although we anticipate continued operating losses in our first fiscal quarter  we expect to reduce outstanding borrowings at january  compared to october   due to planned working capital reductions 
on january   our german subsidiary obtained a million euro working capital credit facility that is available through december  as a result  our domestic credit facility was reduced by million to million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk our earnings are effected by changes in interest expense on our outstanding debt  all of which is subject to floating rates  either libor or prime 
if interest rates on our outstanding borrowings during each of the last two fiscal years were to have increased by one percentage point or basis points over the actual rates that we paid in that year  our interest expense would have increased by approximately  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal see note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the interest rates under our restated credit agreement 
at october   outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facilities were million and our total indebtedness was million 
foreign currency exchange risk in fiscal  approximately of our sales and service fees  including export sales  were derived from foreign markets 
all of our computerized machine systems and computer control systems  as well as certain proprietary service parts  are sourced by our us based engineering and manufacturing division and re invoiced to our foreign sales and service subsidiaries  primarily in their functional currencies 
our products are sourced from foreign suppliers or built to our specifications by either our wholly owned subsidiary in taiwan  or contract manufacturers overseas 
these purchases are predominantly in foreign currencies and in many cases our arrangements with these suppliers include foreign currency risk sharing agreements  which reduce but do not eliminate the effects of currency fluctuations on product costs 
the predominant portion of our exchange rate risk associated with product purchases relates to the new taiwan dollar 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange from time to time to hedge the cash flow risk related to forecasted inter company sales  and forecasted inter company and third party purchases denominated in  or based on  foreign currencies 
we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes
