fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased million  or from fiscal sales 
the increase was due to an increase of approximately million from stores opened since april   as well as a comparable store sales increase of 
there were selling days in fiscal year and days in fiscal year adjusted for days  comparable store sales increased 
during the year  four stores were opened and one was closed 
at march   the company had stores in operation 
management believes that the improvement in sales resulted from several factors aimed at driving store traffic  including an increase in the number of oil changes performed  an increase in scheduled maintenance services and an increase in commercial fleet business 
coupled with price increases in areas such as shop supply and environmental fees  as well as in some product categories  the company was able to offset the continuing decline in exhaust sales 
the exhaust decline resulted  in part  from manufacturers use of non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems on almost all new cars beginning in the mid s and completed in the mid s which has extended the life of exhaust systems and resulted in declining exhaust sales 
the company introduced scheduled maintenance services in all of its stores late in the fourth quarter of fiscal these services are required by vehicle manufacturers to comply with warranty schedules  and are offered by monro in a more convenient and cost competitive fashion than auto dealers can provide 
management believes that these services  which are offered both in bundled packages and individually  will continue to contribute positively to comparable store sales in future years  and help mitigate the aforementioned decline in exhaust which negatively impacted recent fiscal years 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to a decline in distribution and occupancy costs which are included in cost of sales 
as comparable store sales improve  the company is able to better leverage these costs  many of which are fixed 
in addition  the company purposefully increased its spending in the building maintenance area in fy to improve its stores  both structurally and cosmetically 
this expense was scaled back in fy in fy  the company also reduced its accrual for real estate taxes for prior year taxes  which it believes will never be paid  related to closed stores 
additionally  the company realized the benefits of warehouse process improvements including more efficient distribution and increased backhauling  resulting in a reduction in this expense line 
technician labor  which is included in cost of sales  also declined slightly as compared to the prior year  due to improved productivity and control 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in material costs  primarily in the area of parts purchased outside the company s normal distribution system outside purchases 
outside purchases increased as a percent of sales due to the company s foray into new services where it may not always have the required parts in stock 
additionally  parts proliferation continues to present challenges 
material costs also increased due to a shift in mix from exhaust and brakes  which carry lower material costs  to tires and maintenance services  which carry higher material costs 
in addition  the lifo reserve increased for the first time in several years due to an increase in the government indices for auto parts and tires 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million to million and  as a percentage of sales  increased by as compared to fiscal three tenths of the increase  or  is attributable to the compensation expense associated with the vesting of performance based stock options granted in december to the company s chief executive officer 
the options vested in the first quarter of fiscal when the company s stock traded at for consecutive trading days 
the balance of the increase is primarily due to increased depreciation related to the new store point of sales systems installed in fiscal  increased store manager wages to improve the quality and retention of store managers  and slightly less cooperative advertising credits earned in fiscal as compared to fiscal operating income in fiscal of million  or of sales  decreased by 
million from the fiscal level of million  due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased as a percent of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the weighted average interest rate for the year ended march  was approximately lower than the rate of for the year ended march  additionally  the weighted average debt outstanding for the year ended march  decreased by approximately million from fiscal  resulting in a decrease in expense between the two years 
the company s effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal and in fiscal the company recorded a one time tax benefit of 
million in the quarter ended june   due to a reduction in the company s effective tax rate 
there has been a reduction in the company s overall effective state income tax rate because of the company s growth in lower taxing states  especially in connection with the fiscal year speedy acquisition 
this one time adjustment reduced the accrual for amounts provided in prior fiscal years 
additionally  this state rate reduction continued throughout fiscal year  and accordingly  the company reduced the provision for taxes from to of pre tax income for fiscal net income for fiscal increased by million  or of sales  as compared to fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal decreased 
million  or 
from fiscal sales 
the decrease was due to a loss of sales from closed stores of million and a comparable store sales decrease of 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately million from stores opened since april  there were selling days in fiscal year and days in fiscal year adjusted for days  comparable store sales decreased 
during the year  four stores were opened and five were closed 
at march   the company had stores in operation 
management believes that the comparable store sales decrease resulted  in part  from manufacturers use of non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems on almost all new cars beginning in the mid s and completed in the mid s which has extended the life of exhaust systems and resulted in declining exhaust sales 
however  management believes that these declines were partially offset by positive industry factors including an increase in the average age of vehicles  a decrease in the number of service bays  an increase in the number of registered vehicles  and a shift in the consumer mentality from do it yourself to do it for me caused by the increased complexity of cars and aging population 
additionally  management believes that the company s strategy of product diversification and expanded manager training assisted in minimizing the comparable store sales decline vis a vis its competitors 
in addition  management believes that comparable store sales have suffered in recent years from a decline in vehicle population in the five to nine year old segment 
although the number of registered vehicles has increased steadily in recent years  the early s recession in new car sales negatively impacted this particular segment of the vehicle population 
this segment represents the prime repair age of vehicles and is the target market for the company s services 
however  as a result of increased car sales in the mid to late s  the five to nine year old segment began to increase in calendar gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to a decrease in technician labor costs as a percent of sales due to improved productivity and control during the year ended march  however  this improvement was partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs as a percent of sales reflecting the impact of fixed costs such as rent and depreciation against a decline in comparable store sales 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by 
million to million and  as a percentage of sales  increased by 
as compared to fiscal although spending was relatively flat in this line item  there was pressure on certain expense lines which were overcome through savings in others 
more employees earned a bonus in fiscal than in fiscal  increasing expense by 
million 
additionally  utilities increased by approximately 
million over the prior year due to colder weather and higher gas prices 
due to the hardening of the insurance market  the company also experienced an increase in insurance costs in the form of increased deductibles this in spite of a lower number and relatively flat dollar amount of claims as compared to fiscal these increases were offset  however  by strong cost control in other areas such as health care costs and field operations support costs 
additionally  there was an increase in cooperative advertising credits resulting from improved purchasing agreements with the company s major parts suppliers 
operating income in fiscal of million  or of sales  increased by 
million over the fiscal level of million  due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased as a percent of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the weighted average interest rate for the year ended march  was approximately 
higher than the rate of for the year ended march  however  the weighted average debt outstanding for the year ended march  decreased by approximately million from fiscal  resulting in a decrease in expense between the two years 
other expense  net  at 
of sales for the year ended march  decreased from 
of sales for the year ended march  this decrease was primarily due to less expense related to store closings 
the company s effective tax rate was of pre tax income in both fiscal and fiscal net income for fiscal increased by million  or of sales  as compared to fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources the company s primary capital requirements for fiscal were divided among the funding of its new store expansion program and the upgrading of facilities and systems in existing stores  totaling million  as well as net principal payments on long term debt and capital leases of million 
in both fiscal years and  these capital requirements were primarily met by cash flow from operations and through the use of a revolving credit facility 
in december  the company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan for up to  of the company s common shares 
in may  the board of directors approved an increase of  shares  bringing the total authorization to  shares

the company also plans to continue to seek suitable acquisition candidates 
it financed the april acquisition of kimmel automotive  inc primarily through borrowings under its existing bank revolving credit facility 
management believes that the company has sufficient resources available including cash and equivalents  cash flow from operations and bank financing to expand its business as currently planned for the next several years

both obligations require monthly interest payments  and each may be converted from a floating rate to a fixed rate loan before the last two years of their respective terms 
the mortgage requires equal monthly installments of principal based on a year amortization period  and the term loan requires constant monthly payments of principal to fully amortize the debt over the eight year term

financial accounting standards on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas require the use of purchase accounting for all business combinations and the separate allocation of purchase price to intangible assets if specific criteria are met 
the provisions of sfas provide that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized  but rather tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
the company does not anticipate that these standards will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to all business combinations initiated after june  the company will adopt fas effective march  in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard harmonizes the accounting for impaired assets and resolves some of the implementation issues of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
it retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
it also retains the basic provisions for presenting discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens the scope to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from potential changes in interest rates 
the company regularly evaluates these risks and has entered into four interest rate swap agreements  expiring from to  with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the agreements limit the interest rate exposure on the company s floating rate debt via the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
fixed rates under these agreements range from to 
at year end march and  approximately and respectively  of the company s long term debt  excluding capital leases  is at fixed interest rates and therefore  the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates 
long term debt  including current portion  had a carrying amount of million and a fair value of million as of march   as compared to a carrying amount of million and a fair value of million as of march  the company s cash flow exposure on floating rate debt  which is not supported by interest rate swap agreements  would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately 
million for fiscal year ended march  and 
million for fiscal year ended march   given a change in libor 
the company believes the amount of risk and the use of derivative financial instruments described above are not material to the company s financial condition or results of operations
