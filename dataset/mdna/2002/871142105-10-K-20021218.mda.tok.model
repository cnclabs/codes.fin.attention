item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of consumable dental products and related small equipment  and a manufacturer and distributor of products for use in infection prevention in both the medical and dental markets 
prior to december   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of sybron international corporation  which is now known as apogent technologies inc on december   sybron international spun off its dental business by way of a pro rata distribution to its shareholders of all of our outstanding common stock together with related preferred stock purchase rights 
as a result of the spin off  we became an independent  publicly traded company 
as of october   we consolidated our infection prevention business segment into our professional dental business segment to reduce costs and coordinate marketing efforts for our infection prevention products 
through september  our business segments were professional dental  orthodontics and infection prevention 
during the quarter ended june   we changed our method of accounting for our domestic inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
our historical financial statements have been adjusted for all relevant prior periods in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes to reflect this change in method of inventory accounting

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in item of this annual report 
results of operations overview net sales in and increased by in both years from corresponding prior year periods 
including restructuring charges  operating income decreased in by from the prior year period  and increased by in over the prior year period 
excluding the restructuring charges  operating income in and decreased by and  respectively  from the prior year periods 
for the fiscal year ended september   domestic sales remained relatively flat over the prior fiscal year while international sales grew over the prior fiscal year 
international sales were positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar 
without currency effects  international sales would have increased by 
net sales and operating income in were negatively impacted by our decision to discontinue our tradition of quarterly incentives to our dental and medical distribution partners 
historically  our quarterly promotions provided incentives for dealers to make larger purchases at the end of each quarter 
we elected in the fourth quarter of to discontinue those promotions in an effort to more closely align the end user demand for our products with our dealer purchases 
we believe these actions addressed a number of issues that were negatively impacting our performance and will enable us to profitably grow the business going forward

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense of goodwill and other intangible assets is allocated among cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and other expense 
depreciation and amortization expense of goodwill and other intangible assets increased million in due to additional amortization from the step up of assets  goodwill and intangibles recorded from the various acquisitions  as well as routine capital expenditures 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and are inherently uncertain 
as a result  changes in estimates  assumptions and general market conditions on which our judgments and estimates are based  could cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results 
intangible assets intangible assets  other than goodwill  are recorded at cost and are amortized  using the straight line method  over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill excess of cost over the net asset value of acquired businesses recorded prior to june   is amortized over to years  proprietary technology  trademarks  and other intangibles are amortized over to years  years  and to years  respectively 
goodwill recorded subsequent to june  is not being amortized to earnings  but is to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with the implementation of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of products  when the risks and rewards of ownership are passed  when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured 
a large portion of our sales of professional dental products and infection prevention products is sold through distributors 
revenues associated with sales to distributors are also recognized upon shipment of products when all risks and rewards of ownership of the product are passed 
additionally  we accrue rebates based upon our various pricing programs 
these rebates are accounted for as a reduction of revenue 
the allowance for doubtful receivables is reviewed and adjusted periodically 
accounts that are judged to have a collection uncertainty are reserved for  in part or in total  based on management s estimate of the collectable balance 
inventories periodically we review our inventory for potentially excess and or obsolete items by comparing the historical demand to the expected future demand and adjust our obsolescence reserves accordingly 
in addition  standard costs are updated annually to reflect changes in our inventory costs 
if circumstances change eg  unexpected shifts in market demand there could be a material impact on the net realizable value of the inventory 
pension and other postretirement benefits various assumptions including  but not limited to  discount rates  average medical and compensation percentage increases and the expected long term rate of return on assets are used in the determination of pension liabilities and assets 
we use professional actuaries to assist in calculating our pension and postretirement healthcare assets  liabilities and benefit expense 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to manage our foreign currency  interest rate exposures  and certain net investments 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the notional amounts of these contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and  thus  are not a measure of our risk 
the net amounts exchanged are calculated on the basis of the notional amounts and other terms of the contracts  such as interest rates or exchange rates  and only represent a small portion of the notional amounts 
the credit and market risk under these agreements is minimized through diversification among counterparties with high credit ratings 
depending on the item being hedged  gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are either recognized in the results of operations as they occur or are deferred until the hedged transaction occurs 
derivatives used as hedges are effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and are designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the derivative are highly inversely correlated with changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item at the inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
the fair value of interest rate swaps that are terminated or required to be de designated due to an event that negates the probability of the hedged forecasted transaction from taking place as may be required by a refinancing  is removed from the unrealized loss or gain on derivative instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the fair value is reclassified into earnings immediately 
for cross currency debt swaps  the fair value remains in currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  until sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of our net investment 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead reviewed for impairment 
under sfas no 
 the amortization of goodwill ceases upon adoption of the statement and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in all cases  the provisions of sfas no 
shall be initially applied at the beginning of a fiscal year 
we have historically amortized our goodwill and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
beginning with the adoption of sfas no 
 we will cease amortizing our goodwill and certain intangible assets as defined in sfas no 
we will adopt sfas no 
as of the beginning of fiscal year ie october  
we recorded amortization expense of goodwill in the amount of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets will not be recorded in future periods 
further  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset and goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of the adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
impairment will first be assessed by identifying our reporting units and determining the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets to those reporting units  and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent that the carrying amount of each reporting unit exceeds its fair value  impairment will be measured as the amount by which the reporting unit s net assets and liabilities recorded and unrecorded exceed its fair value 
we have not fully determined the effect of adopting sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in the quarter ending december  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
no later than our first fiscal year beginning after december   and will adopt its provisions in the quarter ending december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the provisions of sfas no 
for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of the fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
eliminates the requirement to classify gains and losses from the extinguishment of indebtedness as extraordinary  requires certain lease modifications to be treated the same as a sale leaseback transaction  and makes other non substantive technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may   with earlier adoption encouraged 
we expect the only impact of adopting sfas no 
to be the reclassification of current year and prior year extraordinary losses to interest expense and income taxes 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
as the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date  we cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions as discussed in item business new products  we have maintained an active program of development and introduction of new products 
we believe that introducing new products is important to maintain our competitive position 
we have also pursued numerous acquisition opportunities  completing acquisitions between and acquisitions completed since the beginning of fiscal are as follows acquisition company date description professional dental surgical acuity  inc manufacturer of magnification lenses and fiber optic lighting systems used for illumination during dental procedures

international operations substantial portions of our sales  income and cash flows are derived internationally 
the financial position and the results of operations from substantially all of our international operations  other than most us export sales  are measured using the local currency of the countries in which such operations are conducted and are then translated into us dollars 
while the reported income of foreign subsidiaries will be impacted by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to a particular local currency  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are mitigated by the fact that the subsidiaries operations are conducted in numerous foreign countries and  therefore  in numerous foreign currencies 
in addition  our us export sales may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the value of the us dollar as foreign customers may adjust their level of purchases upward or downward according to the weakness or strength of their respective currencies versus the us dollar 
from time to time we employ currency hedges to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
in june  july and november  we hedged our foreign currency exposure to protect against currency fluctuations in fiscal by securing monthly zero cost collars with a notional amount of approximately million for the euro and a notional amount of approximately million for the japanese yen 
no currency gain or loss was recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended september  however  a currency gain of million net of income tax  representing the fair value of the zero cost collars  was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
additionally  in june  we entered into cross currency debt swap transactions to hedge our net investment in hawe neos and sybron dental specialties japan 
the agreements were contracts to exchange a us dollar principal amount of million in exchange for a swiss franc principal amount of million at the termination date of june  and a us dollar principal amount of million in exchange for a japanese yen principal amount of million at the termination date of june  for fiscal year  the fair value of the cross currency debt swap transaction gain net of income tax included in the cumulative translation adjustments was million 
in september  our foreign currency exposure was hedged to protect against currency fluctuations in fiscal by securing monthly zero cost collars with a notional amount of approximately million for the euro and a notional amount of approximately million for the japanese yen 
no currency gain or loss was recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended september  however  a currency loss of million net of income tax  representing the fair market value of the zero cost collars  was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
additionally  in september  we entered into a cross currency debt swap transaction to hedge our net investment in hawe neos 
the agreement entered into on september   with an effective date of october   is a contract to exchange a us dollar principal amount of million in exchange for a swiss franc principal amount of million at the termination date of october  for fiscal year  the fair value of the cross currency debt swap transaction gain net of income tax included in the cumulative translation adjustments was million 
as a result of terminating the cross currency debt swap transaction to hedge our net investment in hawe neos we recognized a loss to the translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the amount of approximately million net of income tax 
this amount will remain in translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of our net investment in hawe neos 
apogent  prior to the spin off  had also employed currency hedges on our behalf 
in november  apogent decided to employ a series of foreign currency options with a us dollar notional amount of approximately million at a cost of approximately million 
these options were designed to protect sds from potential detrimental effects of currency movements associated with the us dollar versus the euro and japanese yen in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal in fiscal year  euro options expiring on march  and june  were sold at a gain of million and the japanese yen options expiring on march  and june  expired worthless 
approximately million of the euro options gain was allocated to sds 
options expiring september  were sold at a profit with a gain for sds of approximately million 
allocations of gains and losses were based upon sds s exposure to the currencies hedged  relative to the consolidated apogent exposure 
we expect to continue to employ measures to protect our earnings from currency volatility through the use of currency options  forward contracts or similar instruments for fiscal year the following table sets forth our domestic sales and sales outside the united states in  and see also note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
year ended september  in thousands domestic net sales    international net sales    total net sales    inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on net sales or income during any of the periods presented above 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
liquidity and capital resources general prior to the spin off  our capital requirements arose principally from our allocation of indebtedness incurred in connection with the permanent financing for the acquisition of the predecessor to apogent and subsequent refinancings  obligations to pay rent under the sale leaseback facility as defined herein  working capital needs  primarily related to inventory and accounts receivable  capital expenditures  primarily related to purchases of machinery  the purchase of various businesses and product lines in execution of our acquisition strategy  payments to be made in connection with our restructuring in  and the periodic expansion of physical facilities 
we expect our future capital requirements to be similar to those prior to the spin off 
we intend to fund our capital expenditure requirements  working capital requirements  acquisitions  principal and interest payments  obligations under the sale leaseback defined below  restructuring expenditures  other liabilities and periodic expansion of facilities  to the extent available  with funds provided by operations and short term borrowings under the revolver defined below 
while cash provided from operating activities may be impacted by lower revenues due to the slowing economy and the continued risk of a competitive market and changes in demand for our products  we believe that our cash flow from operations  unused amounts available under our new credit facility defined below  and access to capital markets will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital  capital investment  acquisition and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that will be the case 
to the extent that funds are not available from these sources  particularly with respect to our acquisition strategy  we would have to raise additional capital in another manner or curtail our acquisition strategy 
it is currently our intent to reduce total debt and to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy when those acquisitions appear to be in the best interest of the stockholders  taking into account our level of debt and interest expense 
if acquisitions continue at our historical pace  of which there can be no assurance  we may require financing beyond the capacity of our new credit facility defined below 
in addition  certain acquisitions previously completed contain earnout provisions requiring further payments in the future if certain financial results are achieved by the acquired companies 
the statements contained in the immediately preceding paragraph concerning our intent to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy are forward looking statements 
our ability to continue our acquisition strategy is subject to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  our ability to raise capital beyond the capacity of our credit facilities and the availability of suitable acquisitions candidates at reasonable prices 
year ended september  approximately million of cash was generated from operating activities in  as compared to approximately million from the same period of the prior year 
the approximate million decrease in cash flows from operations was primarily due to a an increase in the net change in inventories from the prior year period of approximately million  b a decrease in the net change in accrued payroll and employee benefits from the prior year period of approximately million  c a decrease in the net change in accounts payable from the prior year period of approximately million  d decreased earnings from the prior year period of approximately million  e a decrease in the net change of income taxes payable from the prior year period of approximately million  f a decrease in the net change in other assets and liabilities of approximately million from the prior year period  g a decrease in the provision for losses on doubtful receivables from the prior year period of approximately million  and h a decrease in the net change in the loss gain on sales of property  plant and equipment from the prior year period of approximately million 
the decrease in cash flows from operations were partially offset by the following a a decrease in the net change in accounts receivable from the prior year period of approximately million  b an increase in non cash charges of approximately million  related to the termination of the previous credit facility  c a decrease in the net change in prepaid expenses and other current assets from the prior year period of approximately million  d an increase in the net change in deferred income taxes from the prior year period of approximately million  e an increase in inventory provisions from the prior year period of approximately million  f an increase in amortization expense of goodwill and other intangible assets from the prior year period of approximately million  g an increase in the net change in the restructuring reserve from the prior year of approximately million  h an increase in depreciation expense from the prior year period of approximately million  i an increase in the net change in accrued interest of approximately million from the prior year period  j a tax benefit from issuance of our common stock under our employee stock option plan of approximately million recorded in the fiscal period  and k an increase in amortization of deferred financing fees from the prior year period of approximately million 
approximately million of cash was used in investing activities in  a decrease of approximately million from the same period of the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to a the decrease in payments for acquisitions from the prior year period of approximately million and b increased proceeds from the sales of property  plant and equipment from the prior year of approximately million  partially offset by a an increase in net payments for intangibles from the prior year period of approximately million and b an increase in capital expenditures of approximately million from the prior year period 
in  approximately million of cash was used in investing activities  an increase of approximately million from the same period in the prior year primarily due to additional payments for acquisitions from the prior year period of approximately million  increased capital expenditures from the prior year period of approximately million  and lower proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment from the prior year period of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in net payments for intangibles from the prior year period of approximately million 
approximately million of cash was used in financing activities in  a decrease of approximately million from the approximately million cash provided by financing activities in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to a a decrease in the net loan proceeds of approximately million from the prior year period  b a decrease in net proceeds from our underwritten stock offering of approximately million from the prior year period  c the increase in deferred financing fees from the prior year period of approximately million  d a prepayment penalty and termination costs of approximately million related to the refinancing  e the decrease in capital contributions from apogent from the prior year period of approximately million as a result of the spin off  and f a payment related to the terminated cross currency debt swap of approximately million 
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a net proceeds from the sale of the senior subordinated notes of million  b the elimination of cash dividend payments to apogent in fiscal from the prior year period of approximately million as a result of the spin off and c the net change in advances and loans to apogent from the prior year period of approximately million also as a result of the spin off 
in  the approximate million increase in cash provided by financing activities from the prior year period was primarily attributed to a the net proceeds from our underwritten stock offering of approximately million  b the net change in advances and loans to apogent from the prior year period of approximately million  c a net change in other financing activities from the prior year period of approximately million and d an increase in cash received from the exercise of stock options of approximately million 
the cash provided by financing activities in were partially offset by a a decrease in the capital contributions from apogent from the prior year period of approximately million  b an increase in loan activity from the prior year period of approximately million  c an increase in the cash dividend payment to apogent from the prior year period of approximately million and d the payment of deferred financing fees related to the sds credit facility of approximately million 
credit facilities and senior subordinated notes on june   we terminated our existing million credit facility and entered into a new million syndicated credit facility for which credit suisse first boston is the administrative agent 
the new credit facility the new credit facility  provides for a five year million revolving credit facility the revolver  a seven year million term loan the term loan b and a five year million revolving credit facility the euro tranche 
sybron dental management  inc  kerr corporation  ormco corporation and pinnacle products  inc the domestic borrowers are joint and several borrowers under the revolver and the term loan b  and hawe neos is the borrower under the euro tranche 
in addition to the new credit facility  we completed the sale of million of senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes in a private offering 
we used the proceeds of the term loan b  together with the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes  to repay all of the million of borrowings outstanding as of june  under our previous credit facility 
the new credit facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by sybron dental specialties  inc  the domestic borrowers and each of our present and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  and is secured by substantially all assets of each such entity  including the capital stock of each domestic subsidiary 
in addition  the new credit facility is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock of each of our first tier material foreign subsidiaries 
the euro tranche is also guaranteed by certain foreign subsidiaries and is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries and by some of the assets of our swiss subsidiary  hawe neos  certain direct subsidiaries of hawe neos and certain of our other indirect foreign subsidiaries 
the new credit facility may be prepaid at any time without penalty except for libor and euro libor breakage costs 
under the new credit facility  subject to certain exceptions  we are required to apply all of the proceeds from any issuance of debt  half of the proceeds from any issuance of equity  half of our excess annual cash flow and  subject to permitted reinvestments  all amounts received in connection with any sale of our assets and casualty insurance and condemnation or eminent domain proceedings  in each case to repay the outstanding amounts under the facility 
the term loan b amortizes annually for the first six years  payable quarterly  with the balance to be paid in the seventh year in equal quarterly installments 
the term b loan bears interest  at our option  at either a the libor rate  plus between and basis points  or b between and basis points plus the higher of i the rate from time to time publicly announced by credit suisse first boston as its prime rate  or ii the rate which is of in excess of the federal funds rate  in each case as determined on a quarterly basis according to the rating of the new credit facility by standard and poor s and moody s 
the per annum initial interest rate for the first six months was libor  plus basis points 
as of september  the amount outstanding on the term loan b was million 
the average interest rate at september  on the term loan b was after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements we had in effect as of that date 
the revolver bears interest  at our option  at a per annum rate equal to either a the libor rate  plus between and basis points  or b between and basis points plus the higher of i the rate from time to time publicly announced by credit suisse first boston as its prime rate  or ii the rate which is of in excess of the federal funds rate  in each case as determined on a quarterly basis according to a leveraged based pricing grid with leverage ratios from x to x 
the per annum initial interest rate on the revolver for the first six months was libor plus basis points 
the annual commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolver will very between to based on the quarterly leverage ratio 
as of september  the amount outstanding on the revolver was million 
the average interest rate at september  on the revolver was 
the revolver also provides for the issuance of standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit as required in the ordinary course of business 
as of september   a total of million in letters of credit was issued 
as of september  the amount available under the revolver was million 
the euro tranche bears interest  at our option  at euro libor or at base rates with margins identical to those of the revolver 
the annual commitment fee on the unused portion of the euro tranche will vary between to based on the quarterly leverage ratio 
as of september   there was no outstanding balance under the euro tranche and the amount available was million 
the new credit facility contains certain covenants  including  without limitation  restrictions on i debt and liens  ii the sale of assets  iii mergers  acquisitions and other business combinations  iv transactions with affiliates  v capital expenditures  vi restricted payments  including repurchase or redemptions of the notes  and vii loans and investments  as well as prohibitions on the payment of cash dividends to or the repurchase or redemption of stock from stockholders 
the new credit facility also has certain financial covenants  including  without limitation  maximum leverage ratios  minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  minimum net worth and maximum capital expenditures 
our ability to meet our debt service requirements and to comply with such covenants is dependent upon our future performance  which is subject to financial  economic  competitive and other factors affecting us  many of which are beyond our control 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at september  prior to june   we had a credit facility that we entered into in connection with the spin off on december   which allowed for borrowings up to million from abn amro bank nv and certain other lenders 
this credit facility was composed of a million five year tranche a term loan  a million seven year tranche b term loan  under which kerr and ormco were borrowers  and a five year revolving credit facility up to million  under which sybron dental management  inc  was the borrower 
the tranche a term loan bore interest primarily at the adjusted interbank offered rate for eurodollar deposits plus basis points 
the tranche b term loan bore interest primarily at the adjusted interbank offered rate for eurodollar deposits plus basis points 
borrowings under the previous revolving credit facility generally bore interest on the same terms as those under the tranche a term loan  plus we paid a commitment fee on the average unused portion of the revolving credit facility of 
in connection with entering into our new credit facility on june   we issued million of senior subordinated notes bearing interest at  maturing on june  the senior subordinated notes are our unsecured obligations  subordinated in right of payment to all our existing and future senior debt in accordance with the subordination provisions of the indenture 
the senior subordinated notes are generally not redeemable at our option before june  some limited redemption is allowed if we receive cash from an equity offering 
at any time and from time to time on or after june   we may redeem the senior subordinated notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
twelve month period commencing june  percentage and thereafter as a result of the terms of our new credit facility  we are sensitive to a rise in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates would result in increased interest expense on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates 
in order to reduce our sensitivity to interest rate increases  from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
as of september   we had three interest rate swaps outstanding aggregating a notional amount of million 
under the terms of the swap agreements  we are required to pay fixed rate amounts equal to the swap agreement rates listed below 
in exchange for the payment of the fixed rate amounts  we receive floating rate amounts equal to the three month libor rate in effect on the date of the swap agreements and the subsequent reset dates 
for the swap agreements  the rate resets on the quarterly anniversary of the swap agreement dates until the swaps expiration dates 
the net interest rate paid by us on the indicated notional amount is approximately equal to the sum of the relevant swap agreement rate plus the applicable eurodollar rate margin 
the swap agreement rates and durations as of september  are as follows expiration date national amount swap agreement date swap agreement rate swap effective date february  million january  february  march  million january  march  march  million january  march  sale leaseback in  we completed the sale and leaseback the sale leaseback of our then principal domestic manufacturing and office facilities with an unaffiliated third party 
the transaction has been accounted for as a financing for financial statement purposes  thus the facilities remain in property  plant and equipment 
the transaction was treated as a sale for income tax purposes 
the financing obligation is being amortized over the initial year lease term 
the initial term of each lease is years with five five year renewal options 
on the fifth anniversary of the leases and every five years thereafter including renewal terms  the rent is increased by the percentage equal to of the percentage increase in the consumer price index over the preceding five years 
the percentage increase to the rent in any five year period is capped at 
beginning january  annual payments increased to million 
the next adjustment will occur january  as a result of the spin off  the sale leaseback was amended to extend the leases an additional years  increase the basic rent by million per year  and provides us the option to purchase the leased premises at fair value from june  to may  we pay all costs of maintenance and repair  insurance  taxes and all other expenses associated with the properties 
we have the option to purchase the facilities according to the terms of any bona fide offer received by the lessor from a third party at any time during the term of the leases 
we may be obligated to repurchase the properties upon the event of a breach of certain covenants or occurrence of certain other events 
stock offering on june   we sold  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering generating net proceeds of approximately million  which were primarily used to repay money borrowed to finance the acquisitions of hawe neos and obf technologies  inc contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table represents a list of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments for the indicated periods calculated as of september   payments due for the twelve month periods ending september  thereafter total in thousands long term debt        senior subordinated notes   standby letters of credit   operating leases        total contractual cash obligations        cautionary factors this report contains  and other disclosures that we make from time to time may contain  forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of words such as anticipate  believe  continue  estimate  expect  goal  objective  outlook  could  intend  may  might  plan  potential  predict  should  or will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology signify forward looking statements 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or our financial conditions  or state other forward looking information 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward looking statements 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results 
in addition to the assumptions and other factors referenced specifically in connection with such statements  the following factors could impact our business and financial prospects and affect our future results of operations and financial condition our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we presently have  and will continue to have  a substantial amount of indebtedness which required significant interest payments 
as of september   we had million in total long term borrowings including current portion  and million in stockholders equity 
in addition  subject to restrictions in the indenture for our senior subordinated notes and our new credit facility  we may incur additional indebtedness 
our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences  which include the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our senior subordinated notes and other indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes such as potential acquisitions and capital expenditures  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interest  including through interest rate swap agreements  we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in our industry  including increased competition  and we are more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
from time to time we have engaged in interest rate hedges to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
if we are unable to  or elect not to employ interest rate hedges  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
in addition  our credit facilities contain numerous restrictive operating and financial covenants  which could limit our operating flexibility 
our ability to pay or refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors beyond our control 
increases in interest rates would adversely affect our cash flows and therefore our results of operations 
in addition  the terms of any additional debt or equity financing that we may incur could restrict our operational flexibility and prevent us from pursuing business opportunities of value to our stockholders 
we are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends  interest income and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations 
we are a united states holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries  some of which are located in other countries 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will therefore be dependent on receipt of dividends  interest income and loans from our direct and indirect subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries may be limited in the amounts they are permitted to pay as dividends to us on their capital stock as a result of statutory and other contractual restrictions 
in particular  there are significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of non us subsidiaries to remit money to us 
as a result  some or all of our subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends to us 
if they do not  we may not be able to make debt service payments on our debt instruments 
future exchange rate fluctuations or inflation may adversely affect our results of operations 
we manufacture many of our products  including those in our professional dental business segment  in our facilities in mexico  canada  switzerland and italy 
these products are supported by our sales offices in europe  japan  australia  south america and mexico 
in fiscal  our foreign facilities selling  general and administrative expenses represented approximately of our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses while our foreign sales represented approximately of our total net sales 
we measure our financial position and results of operations from substantially all of our international operations  other than most us export sales  using local currency of the countries in which we conduct such operations and then translate them into us dollars 
the reported income of our foreign subsidiaries will be impacted by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to a particular local currency 
our us export sales may also be affected by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the value of the us dollar as foreign customers may adjust their level of purchases according to the weakness or strength of their respective currencies versus the us dollar 
in addition  any future increases in the inflation rate in any country where we have operations may negatively affect our results of operations 
to the extent these local currencies appreciate against the us dollar  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have engaged in currency hedges to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
if we are unable to  or elect not to continue to employ currency hedges  it could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
as we expand our international presence  these risks may increase 
acquisitions have been and continue to be an important part of our growth strategy  failure to consummate strategic acquisitions could limit our growth and failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely impact our results 
our business strategy includes continued growth through strategic acquisitions  which depends upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices and our ability to quickly resolve transitional challenges 
failure to consummate appropriate acquisitions would adversely impact our growth and failure to successfully integrate them would adversely affect our results 
these challenges include integration of product lines  sales forces and manufacturing facilities and decisions regarding divestitures  cost reductions  and realizing other synergies 
also  these challenges involve risks of employee turnover  disruption in product cycles and the loss of sales momentum 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully manage them in the future 
also  our new credit facility and the indenture for the senior subordinated notes limit our ability to consummate acquisitions by imposing various conditions which must be satisfied 
our profitability may be affected by factors outside our control 
our ability to increase sales  and to profitably distribute and sell our products  is subject to a number of risks  including changes in our business relationships with our principal distributors  competitive risks such as the entrance of additional competitors into our markets  pricing and technological competition  risks associated with the development and marketing of new products in order to remain competitive and risks associated with changes in demand for dental services which can be affected by economic conditions  health care reform  government regulation  and more stringent limits on expenditures by dental insurance providers or governmental programs 
we strive to increase our margins by controlling our costs and by improving our manufacturing efficiencies 
there can be no assurance  however  that our efforts will continue to be successful 
margins can be affected by many factors  including competition  product mix  and the effect of acquisitions 
if we are unable to successfully manage growth and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to compete effectively and our revenues may drop significantly 
we intend to continue to expand our business over time into new geographic regions and additional products and services  subject to the sufficiency of our cash resources and our ability to comply with the covenants in our various debt instruments 
our future performance will depend  in large part  upon our ability to implement and manage our growth effectively 
our growth in the future will continue to place a significant strain on our administrative  operational  and financial resources 
we anticipate that  if we are successful in expanding our business  we will be required to recruit and hire a substantial number of new managerial  finance  accounting  and support personnel 
failure to retain and attract additional management personnel who can manage our growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on our performance 
to manage our growth successfully  we will also have to continue to improve and upgrade operational  financial and accounting systems  controls and infrastructure as well as expand  train and manage our employees 
our failure to manage the future expansion of our business could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
our ability to hire and retain competent employees is also subject to a number of risks  including unionization of our non union employees and changes in relationships with our unionized employees 
in particular  many of our non management employees in europe are subject to national labor contracts  which are negotiated from time to time at the national level between the national labor union and the employees council 
there is a risk of strikes or other labor disputes at our locations which are unionized or are subject to national contracts which could affect our operations 
we rely heavily upon key distributors  and we could lose sales if any of them stop doing business with us 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales were made through our top five independent distributors 
mergers and consolidation of our distributors have temporarily slowed sales of our products in the past and may do so in the future 
we believe that the loss of either henry schein  inc or patterson dental co  the only distributors who account for more than of our sales  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition until we find alternative means to distribute our products 
we are subject to product liability litigation and related risks which could adversely affect our business 
because many of our products are designed for use in and around a patient s mouth  and because many of these products contain chemicals  metals  and other materials  we are subject to claims and litigation brought by patients or dental professionals alleging harm caused by the use of or exposure to our products 
we may need to devote substantial amounts of time and attention to defending ourselves and may also be required to pay large amounts in settlement or upon judgment 
we may also be required to or may voluntarily recall products  which would require substantial effort and cost 
litigation or a product recall could divert significant amounts of our management s time from other important matters 
our business could also be adversely affected by public perceptions about the safety of our products  whether or not any such concerns are justified 
our business is subject to quarterly variations in operating results due to factors outside of our control 
our business is subject to quarterly variations in operating results caused by a number of factors  including business and industry conditions  the timing of acquisitions  distribution chain issues  and other factors beyond our control 
all these factors make it difficult to predict operating results for any particular period 
we may be subject to risks arising from other business and investment considerations that may be disclosed from time to time in our securities and exchange commission filings or in other publicly written documents 
changes in international trade laws and in the business  political and regulatory environment abroad could materially adversely affect our business 
our foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in canada  switzerland  italy and mexico 
accordingly  an event that has a material adverse impact on our foreign operations may materially adversely affect our operations as a whole 
the business  regulatory and political environments in countries where we have operations differ from those in the united states and our foreign operations are exposed to a number of inherent risks  including  but not limited to changes in international trade laws  such as the north american free trade agreement  or nafta  affecting our activities in mexico and canada  changes in local labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain local employees  currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations in the value of foreign currency  potentially adverse tax consequences  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  political conditions in countries where we have operations  unexpected changes in the regulatory environment  and changes in general economic conditions in countries  such as italy and mexico  that have historically been less stable than the united states 
if any of the events described were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as we incur more indebtedness and greater interest expense  we may not be able to maintain our level of investment in research and development 
the indenture relating to our senior subordinated notes and our new credit facility permit us to incur significant amounts of additional debt 
if we incur additional debt  our interest expense will rise 
we may find we do not have enough available cash to pay for the increased interest expense and other budgeted expenses 
we may need to reduce our discretionary expenses  including research and development  which could reduce or delay the introduction of new products 
we may not be able to maintain our level of investment in research and development as we incur more indebtedness and greater interest expense 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively 
numerous competitors participate in our business segments  some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
our principal competitors in the professional dental business segment include dentsply international inc  m corporation and its affiliate espe gmbh co  and ivoclar vivadent group  in the orthodontics business segment  our principal competitors include unitek  a subsidiary of m corporation  gac orthodontics  a subsidiary of dentsply  and american orthodontics  and in the infection prevention business segment  our principal competitors include johnson johnson  steris corporation  and ecolab  inc we may face increased competition from these or other companies in the future and we may not be able to achieve or maintain adequate market share or margins  or compete effectively  in any of our markets 
any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect our revenues and operating profits and hinder our future expansion 
certain of our products and manufacturing facilities are subject to regulation  and our failure to obtain or maintain the required regulatory approvals for these products could hinder or prevent their sale and increase our costs of regulatory compliance 
our ability to continue manufacturing and selling those of our products that are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration  state laws or other domestic or foreign governments or agencies is subject to a number of risks  including the promulgation of stricter laws or regulations  reclassification of our products into categories subject to more stringent requirements  or the withdrawal of the approval needed to sell one or more of our products 
the costs of complying with these regulations and the delays in receiving required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulations or regulatory requirements may force us to cut back our operations  recall products  increase our costs of regulatory compliance  prevent us from selling a product or hinder our growth 
we may be required to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to apogent  or may not be able to collect on indemnification rights from apogent 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements executed in connection with our spin off from apogent  we and our us subsidiaries  in general  indemnify apogent and its subsidiaries and affiliates against liabilities  litigation and claims actually or allegedly arising out of the dental business  including discontinued operations relating to our business 
similarly  apogent and its us subsidiaries indemnify us and our subsidiaries and affiliates against liabilities  litigation and claims actually or allegedly arising out of apogent s business  including discontinued operations related to the laboratory business  and other operations and assets not transferred to us 
these indemnification obligations could be significant 
the availability of these indemnities will depend upon the future financial strength of each of the companies 
we cannot determine whether we will have substantial indemnification obligations to apogent and its affiliates in the future 
we also cannot assure you that  if apogent has substantial indemnification obligations to us and our affiliates  apogent will have the ability to satisfy those obligations 
we could be adversely affected if the spin off is not tax free  we have agreed to indemnify apogent if we experience a change in control that causes the spin off to be taxable 
in connection with the spin off  apogent received rulings from the internal revenue service that  for federal income tax purposes  the transactions undertaken in connection with the spin off  and the spin off itself  would be tax free to apogent and its shareholders 
these rulings are subject to the validity of factual representations made to the irs and assumptions and conditions set out in the ruling request 
in order to assure that the representations made in connection with the ruling request are true  we have agreed with apogent to certain restrictions on future actions for a period of time following the spin off 
in particular  we have agreed to continue the active conduct of our historic business for a minimum of two years  and we have agreed not to issue stock  merge with another corporation  or dispose of our assets in a manner that would cause the spin off to be treated as part of a plan pursuant to which one or more persons acquire a or greater interest in our stock 
we have agreed to indemnify apogent if the spin off is treated as having been taxable by reason of any breach of these agreements 
our indemnification of apogent for these liabilities would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
except as may be required by applicable securities laws or regulations  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange currency risk management we operate internationally  therefore  our earnings  cash flows  and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables  forecasted sales transactions  as well as net investments in certain foreign operations 
these items are denominated in foreign currencies  including but not limited to the euro  japanese yen  swiss franc  mexican peso  canadian dollar  and the australian dollar 
we believe it is prudent to minimize the variability caused by foreign currency risk 
we attempt to minimize foreign currency risk by using derivative instruments when prudent 
we do not use derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging 
although we have a us dollar functional currency  a substantial portion of our sales  income  and cash flow are derived from foreign currencies 
our foreign currency exposure exists primarily in the euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar  swiss franc  mexican peso and australian dollar versus the us dollar 
for fiscal year  our projected total foreign currency exposure is estimated to be approximately million euros  million japanese yen  million canadian dollars  million australian dollars  and million swiss francs 
we have put in place a strategy to manage our euro and japanese yen cash flow exposure through the use of zero cost collar contracts 
there were no such contracts in place for the canadian dollar  australian dollar  and swiss franc at september  in july  we entered into a zero cost collar contract to hedge intercompany transactions with a notional amount of million euros for fiscal year also  in june  we entered into a zero cost collar contract to hedge a notional amount of million japanese yen for fiscal year at september   approximately million of gain net of income tax representing the fair value of the zero cost collars  is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  related to the foreign currency zero cost collar transactions 
in addition  none of the foreign currency cash flow hedges have been discontinued 
zero cost collar contracts in place as of september  are as follows in thousands  except rates local maturity currency currency trade date effective date date amount floor rate ceiling rate euro  yen  in august  we entered into a series of zero cost collar contracts to hedge intercompany transactions with a total notional amount of million euros for fiscal year in addition  we entered into a zero cost collar contract to hedge a total notional amount of million japanese yen for fiscal year for fiscal year  approximately million of loss  net of income tax  was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  related to the foreign currency zero cost collar transactions 
in addition  none of the foreign currency cash flow hedges have been discontinued 
as of september   the maximum length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows associated with foreign currency forecasted transaction is twelve months for the japanese yen and twelve months for the euro 
in september  we entered into a cross currency debt swap transaction to hedge our net investment in hawe neos 
the agreement had an effective date of october   and was a contract to exchange a us dollar principal amount of million in exchange for a swiss franc principal amount of million at the termination date of october  on june   we terminated this cross currency debt swap transaction to satisfy requirements under our new credit facility 
as of june   we entered into four cross currency debt swap transactions to hedge our net investment in hawe neos and one cross currency debt swap to hedge our net investment in sds japan 
the agreements to hedge our net investment in hawe neos have a total aggregate notional amount of million and in the agreement relating to sds japan has a notional amount of million 
the mechanics of the new agreements are similar to the original cross currency debt swap terminated on june  however  the fixed interest rate to be paid to us in the us dollar leg of the agreements is the rate equal to the senior subordinated notes rate of while the fixed interest rate to be paid by us in the swiss franc leg of the agreements ranges from to and the japanese yen leg of the agreements is  with the interest payments due semi annually 
following are the details of the new cross currency debt swaps amounts in millions  except rates trade date effective date maturity us interest fx amt interest chf chf chf chf jpy at september   the fair value of the cross currency debt swap transaction gain included in translation adjustments was approximately million net of income tax 
as a result of terminating the cross currency debt swap transaction to hedge our net investment in hawe neos we recognized a loss to the translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the amount of approximately million net of income tax 
this amount will remain in translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of our net investment in hawe neos 
interest rate exposure interest rate risk management we use our new credit facility and senior subordinated notes to finance our operations 
the new credit facility exposes us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense also decreases 
under our prior credit facility  we were required to have interest rate protection for a specified portion of the outstanding balances for a specified period of time 
although we paid off and terminated that prior credit facility  we retained certain of the interest rate swap agreements we had entered into to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk 
these interest rate swaps change a portion of our variable rate cash flow exposure to fixed rate cash flows 
we continue to assess our exposure to interest rate risk on an ongoing basis 
the table below provides information about the company s debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for these debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward month libor rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the company s reporting currency 
liabilities thereafter fair value in thousands long term debt fixed rate debt   average interest rate variable rate debt        average interest rate for the year ended september   the total net cost of converting from floating rate month libor to fixed rate for a portion of the interest payments under our long term debt obligations was approximately million 
at september   approximately million loss net of income tax is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
below is a table listing the interest expense exposure detail and the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements as of september  dollars in thousands twelve months notional ended september fair value loan amount term trade effective maturity  pre tax kerr b terminated ormco b terminated sdm b  years sdm matured kerr b  years  ormco b  years  sdm b matured totals    for fiscal year  the total net cost of converting from floating rate month libor to fixed rate from a portion of the principal amount of the debt obligation was million

these amounts subsequently are reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in which the related interest on the floating rate debt obligations affects earnings 
on june  we entered into a new million syndicated credit facility for which credit suisse first boston is the administrative agent 
this new credit facility provides for a five year million revolver  a seven year million term loan b and a five year million euro tranche revolving credit facility 
in addition to the new credit facility  we completed the sale of million of senior subordinated notes at interest  due  in a private offering 
we used the proceeds of the term loan b  together with proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes  to repay all of the million of borrowings outstanding as of june  under our previous credit facility 
approximately million of our then existing interest rate swaps could not be re assigned to our new credit facility entered into on june  and thus were terminated 
accordingly  we recorded a loss on derivative instruments of approximately million or approximately million  net of tax in other income expense  which represents the fair value of the swaps at the termination date 
additionally  we had to de designate the remaining interest rate swaps as a result of the specificity of our hedge documentation relating to the hedged item 
accordingly  a non cash loss on derivative instruments of approximately million or approximately million  net of tax  representing the fair value of the remaining swaps at the date of the refinancing  was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss and recorded in other income expense to recognize the loss 
however  these swaps were continued and were simultaneously re assigned to the new credit facility 
the change in the fair value of these re assigned swaps from the refinancing date to september  has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the re assigned interest rate swap agreements are expected to be highly effective as we expect the hedging relationship to meet the relevant hedge accounting criteria of sfas no 
the re assigned interest rate swap agreements showed no recognizable ineffectiveness during the year ended september
