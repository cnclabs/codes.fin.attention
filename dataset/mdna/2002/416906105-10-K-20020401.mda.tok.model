item business 
overview we are a global provider of innovative  research enabling tools that solve problems in drug discovery 
we provide a broad array of tools designed to accelerate the speed and to reduce the cost at which our customers can introduce new drugs 
we focus on alleviating bottlenecks in the drug discovery process including target validation  assay development and admet absorption  distribution  metabolism  elimination and toxicology screening 
to address these critical bottlenecks  we have recently introduced several new proprietary tools 
for target validation  these tools include novel pipette tips  micro dialyzers  plate readers and copas high throughput high relevance model organism screening systems 
for admet screening  these tools include navicyte diffusion chambers for drug absorption testing  well equilibrium dialysis plates for drug distribution testing  mitoscan high throughput toxicology assays and copas high throughput high relevance model organism toxicology testing systems 
we have an established product base in target validation 
this product base consists of dna rna protein calculators  life science spectrophotometers and amino acid analysis systems 
we also have an established product base in admet screening which includes precision infusion pumps  organ testing systems  ventilators  cell biology and electrophysiology products 
the names harvard bioscience and harvard apparatus and our logo are names and trademarks that we believe belong to us 
we have the rights to numerous trademarks and trade names including amika  biochrom  copas  cpk  genequant  genequant pro  mitoscan  navicyte  novaspec  preptip  puretip  stronghold  ultrospec  union biometrica and warner instruments 
this annual report on form k also contains the trademarks and trade names of other entities that are the property of their respective owners 
our history our business began in and has grown over the intervening years with the development and evolution of modern drug discovery tools 
our inventions include the mechanical syringe pump in the s for drug infusion and the microprocessor controlled syringe pump in the s 
in march  a group of investors led by our current management team acquired a majority of the then existing business of our predecessor  harvard apparatus 
following this acquisition  we redirected the focus of the company to participate in the high growth areas bottlenecks within drug discovery by acquiring and licensing innovative technologies while continuing to grow the existing business through internal product development and marketing  partnerships and acquisitions 
through december   we have completed eleven business acquisitions  licensed key new technology for in vitro toxicology assays and drug absorption measurement  internally developed new product lines including new generation syringe pumps  dna rna protein calculators  spectrophotometers and plate readers  and mailed expanded new catalogs 
our strategy our strategy is to become the leading provider of innovative  enabling technologies and products for target validation and screening research in the drug discovery process 
key elements of our strategy are to be innovative by developing new products  to acquire businesses that we believe will either strengthen our core business or provide major breakthroughs for drug discovery research  and to partner with people who have expertise we do not 
innovative new tools for drug discovery we have focused on becoming a leading provider of tools for target validation and admet screening 
we believe that there is a demand for new and innovative tools that reduce drug discovery time and expense 
since  we have introduced several new tools for target validation and admet screening such as our protein and dna purification pipette tips  protein purification dialyzers  navicyte diffusion chambers and the copas model organism screening systems 
in  we introduced new plate readers  new spectrophotometers  a new high throughput toxicology assay called mitoscan  a new ventilator  and copas technology for high throughput model organism research 
we intend to continue our efforts to identify  develop and introduce new tools to alleviate bottlenecks in all stages of the drug discovery process 
acquire complementary technologies we intend to selectively acquire companies and technologies that we believe will strengthen our product offering  particularly in the areas of target validation and admet screening 
since  we have completed nine acquisitions involving the integration of acquired products and technology into our existing manufacturing base or distribution channels  and five technology acquisition or licensing transactions 
in  we acquired asys hitech in austria for its plate readers and low volume dispensers  scie plas in england for its electrophoresis and dna analysis products  international market supply in england for its anesthesiology products  warner instruments in the united states for its cell and tissue electrophysiology products  and union biometrica in the united states for its high throughput high content model organism technology 
in the future  we may pursue acquisitions of new products and technologies through business acquisitions  partnerships or licensing arrangements 
partnerships we intend to leverage our technologies through collaborations with people who have expertise and capabilities we do not 
in  we partnered with a major pharmaceutical company for the development of low volume dispensers  two major pharmaceutical companies for the further development of copas technology  and amersham biosciences formerly amersham pharmacia biotech for distribution of many of our products for dna  rna and protein analysis 
our products our product lines consist of both proprietary and non proprietary products 
our broad array of proprietary products consist of those set forth in the table below and those described in the other proprietary products section below the table product category representative product areas description number of products target validation rna dna analysis molecular biology spectrophotometers range of spectrophotometers dna rna protein calculators spectrophotometers with application software multi well plate readers range of automated readers absorbance luminescence flourescence amino acid analysis systems ninhydrin based amino acid detection systems liquid dispensers low volume high throughput copas model organism testing high throughput screening and sorting fruit flies worms purification purification pipette tips disposable pipette tips coated with purification media loaded with purification media equilibrium dialyzers membrane separating two plastic chambers disposable plates with wells high throughput high content screening admet screening absorption in vitro navicyte diffusion chambers simulated digestive tract blood stream interfaces distribution equilibrium dialysis plate membrane separating two chambers metabolism elimination organ testing systems chambers with stimulators  perfusion and recording devices toxicology mitoscan assay high throughput toxicology assay precision infusion pumps syringe pumps copas reflex zebrafish assay development efficacy screening copas reflex compound library screening fruit flies worms zebrafish target validation rna dna analysis molecular biology spectrophotometers a spectrophotometer is an instrument widely used in molecular biology and cell biology to quantify the amount of a compound in a sample by shining a beam of white light through a prism or grating to divide it into component wavelengths 
each wavelength in turn is shone through a liquid sample and the spectrophotometer measures the amount of light absorbed at each wavelength 
this enables the quantification of the amount of a compound in a sample 
we sell a wide range of spectrophotometers under the names ultrospec and novaspec 
these products are manufactured by our biochrom subsidiary and sold primarily through our distribution arrangement with amersham biosciences 
dna rna protein calculators a dna rna protein calculator is a bench top instrument dedicated to quantifying the amount of dna  rna or protein in a sample 
it uses a process similar to that of a molecular biology spectrophotometer 
these are sold under the names genequant and genequant pro 
launched in  we believe that it was the first such instrument sold 
these products are manufactured by our biochrom subsidiary and sold primarily through amersham biosciences 
multi well plate readers multi well plate readers are widely used for high throughput screening assays in the drug discovery process 
the most common format is wells 
plate readers use light to detect chemical interactions 
we introduced a range of these products in beginning with absorbance readers and followed by luminescence readers 
these products are sold primarily through amersham biosciences 
amino acid analysis systems an amino acid analysis system uses chromatography to separate the amino acids in a sample and then uses a chemical reaction to detect each one in turn as they flow out of the chromatography column 
amino acids are the building blocks of proteins 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the amino acid analysis systems business of the biotronik subsidiary of eppendorf netheler hinz gmbh and integrated it with the existing amino acid analysis systems business in our biochrom subsidiary 
low volume  high throughput liquid dispensers a liquid dispenser dispenses low volumes of liquids into high density microtitre plates used in high throughput screening processes in drug discovery 
our unique technology enables dispensing to take place without the need for contact between the droplet and the liquid already present in the plate  thereby removing any risk of cross contamination from the process 
we acquired asys hitech in december through our biochrom subsidiary 
asys hitech developed and markets both the liquid dispensers and a line of oem plate readers 
target validation copas copas systems the copas system uses large bore flow cytometry and a novel proprietary technique to rapidly analyze and sort the model organisms c 
elegans worm  d 
melanogaster fly  and d 
rerio zebra fish 
automation of the handling of these organisms through the use of the copas system provides scientists a complete integrated solution to rapidly produce and evaluate model organisms 
in may  we acquired union biometrica  the inventor and developer of the copas technology 
target validation protein purification protein purification pipette tips our proprietary preptip consists of a standard disposable pipette tip coated on the inside with the same chromatography media used in packed bed columns 
this coating selectively binds proteins  but not the salts  detergents  electrophoresis gels  buffers and cellular debris that are often mixed in with the proteins 
our preptip pipette tip enables customers to rapidly purify proteins by avoiding the time consuming usage of a centrifuge required when using spin columns 
in addition  it is easy to use because the protein solution is handled entirely within the pipette tip and does not have to be moved through a separate device such as a packed bed column or dialyzer 
because our preptip pipette tips use the same chromatography media as packed bed columns  they can take advantage of the wide range of existing purification protocols using these media 
disposable equilibrium dialyzers our proprietary disposable equilibrium dialyzers are effective cost efficient products for protein binding studies and can handle sample sizes as small as microliters 
dialyzers are small chambers with an open end covered with a membrane 
the membrane allows small molecules to pass through  but not large molecules 
because proteins are large molecules and most contaminants are small molecules  this is an effective way to purify proteins 
these disposable products are particularly useful for binding studies involving radioactively labeled compounds because the dialyzer does not require cleaning after use 
high throughput high content screening admet screening the goal of admet screening is to identify compounds that have toxic side effects or undesirable pharmacological properties 
these pharmacological properties consist of absorption  distribution  metabolism and elimination  which together with toxicology  form the acronym admet 
we have traditionally sold products for admet testing that are based upon animal models 
however  as a result of a series of acquisitions and licensing transactions  we have begun to develop and manufacture organ testing systems  tissue testing systems and serum protein binding assays for early toxicology testing 
navicyte diffusion chambers a diffusion chamber is a small plastic chamber with a membrane separating the two halves of the chamber used to measure the absorption of a drug into the bloodstream 
the membrane can either be tissue such as intestinal tissue or a cultured layer of cells such as human colon cells 
this creates a miniaturized model of intestinal absorption 
we entered this market with our acquisition of the assets of navicyte inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of trega biosciences 
well equilibrium dialysis plate for serum protein binding assays our well equilibrium dialysis plate operates in a similar way to the equilibrium dialyzers for target validation described above 
the difference is that both chambers on either side of the membrane are capped 
the protein target is placed on one side of the membrane and the drug on the other 
the small molecule drug diffuses through the membrane 
if it binds to the target  it cannot diffuse back again 
if it does not bind  it will diffuse back and forth until equilibrium is established 
once equilibrium is established  the concentration of the drug can be measured thereby indicating the strength of the binding 
this product is principally used for admet screening to determine if a drug binds to blood proteins 
a certain level of reversible binding is advantageous in order to promote good distribution of a drug through the human body 
however  if the binding is too strong  it may impair normal protein function and cause toxic effects 
organ testing systems organ testing systems use glass or plastic chambers together with stimulators and recording electrodes to study organ function 
organ testing systems enable either whole organs or strips of tissue from organs such as hearts  livers and lungs to be kept functioning outside the body while researchers perform experiments with them 
they are typically used in place of live animals 
studies on isolated livers are useful in determining metabolism and studies on kidneys are useful in determining elimination 
we have sold basic versions of these systems for many years  but significantly expanded our product offerings through our november acquisition of hugo sachs elektronik 
mitoscan high throughput toxicology screening our proprietary mitoscan high throughput in vitro toxicology assay uses submitochondrial particles  or smp  which are part of the inner membrane of mitochondria 
mitochondria  the power source within a cell  are evolutionarily conserved across the entire animal kingdom and are extremely vulnerable to toxic insult 
the smp  processed from mitochondria  retain this sensitivity and when used in toxicity assays provide a highly relevant toxicologic endpoint indicative of mitochondrial and whole organism responses 
precision infusion pumps infusion pumps  typically syringe pumps  are used to accurately infuse very small quantities of liquid  commonly drugs 
infusion pumps are generally used for long term toxicology testing of drugs by infusion into animals  usually laboratory rats 
we sell types of syringe pumps 
copas reflex system the copas reflex system can be used in toxicology testing on the zebrafish 
the zebrafish has a brain  heart  liver  kidneys  and reproductive organs as well as circulatory  nervous and immune systems making it very similar to the organ system of humans 
also  the zebrafish can be dosed with drugs relatively easily  which in combination with the high throughput capabilities of the copas system  provides a major advantage over other live model organism testing systems such as the mouse 
high throughput high content screening efficacy screening the copas reflex system provides high throughput screening of combinatorial chemical libraries 
before the invention of copas  library screening on organisms was simply impractical since it could only be done one organism at a time  under a microscope 
the copas system can analyze about one million c 
elegans in a normal eight hour day 
other proprietary products cell injection systems cell injection systems use extremely fine bore glass capillaries to penetrate and inject drugs into or around individual cells 
cell injection systems are used to study the effects of drugs on single cells 
injection is accomplished either with air pressure or  if the drug molecule is electrically charged  by applying an electric current 
we entered this market with our acquisition of the research products of medical systems corporation 
ventilators ventilators use a piston driven air pump to inflate the lungs of an anesthestised animal 
ventilators are typically used in surgical procedures common in drug discovery 
our advanced inspira ventilators have significant safety and ease of use features  such as default safety settings 
cpk atomic models cpk atomic models use colored plastic parts to accurately model molecular structures  such as dna 
we offer a wide range of components and assembled models 
stronghold laboratory clamps stronghold laboratory clamps are made from glass reinforced nylon 
our clamps resist rusting which is a common problem with steel clamps 
we provide a wide variety of clamps  stands and lattices 
oem products our reputation for quality  durability and reliability has led to the formation of a number of original equipment manufacturer  or oem  relationships with major life science instrument companies 
these relationships are conducted through purchase orders and are not contractual 
a good example of these relationships is with respect to our syringe pumps 
our syringe pumps are capable of delivering flow rates as low as microliters per hour while maintaining high accuracy 
we have adapted  in conjunction with our oems  the core technology embodied in our syringe pumps to make specialized sample injectors for many of the major mass spectrometry manufacturers 
distributed products in addition to our proprietary  manufactured products  we buy and resell products through our catalog that are made by other manufacturers 
we have negotiated supply agreements with the majority of the companies that provide our distributed products 
these supply agreements specify pricing only and contain no minimum purchase commitments 
none of these agreements represented more than two percent of our revenues for the year ended december  distributed products accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  these distributed products enable us to provide our customers with a single source for their experimental needs 
these complementary products consist of a large variety of devices  instruments and consumable items used in experiments involving animals and biological tissue in the fields of proteomics  physiology  pharmacology  neuroscience  cell biology  molecular biology and toxicology 
our proprietary  manufactured products are often leaders in their fields but researchers often need complementary products in order to conduct particular experiments 
most of these complementary products come from small companies that do not have our extensive distribution and marketing capabilities 
our customers our customers are primarily end user research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and government laboratories  such as the us national institutes of health  or nih 
our largest customers in the united states include baylor college of medicine  bristol myers squibb company  eli lilly and company  johns hopkins university  merck co  inc  nih  parke davis  pfizer inc  schering plough corporation  smithkline beecham plc  orthomcneil  duke university  massachusetts general hospital  stowers institute and the university of california 
we conduct direct sales in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  france  belgium  spain  the netherlands and canada 
we also maintain distributors in other countries 
aggregate sales to our largest customer  amersham biosciences  a distributor with end users similar to ours  accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  we have several thousand customers worldwide and no other customer accounted for more than five percent of our revenues for such period 
sales and marketing direct sales we periodically produce and mail approximately  copies of our  page catalog  which contains approximately  items 
we distribute the majority of our products ordered from our catalog  which can also be accessed on our website  through our worldwide subsidiaries 
our manufactured products accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  our market leadership position in many of our manufactured products create traffic to the catalog and web site and enables cross selling and facilitates the introduction of new products 
in addition to the comprehensive catalog  we create and mail abridged catalogs that focus on specific product areas along with direct mailers  which introduce or promote new products 
amersham biosciences distributor in august  we entered into a new agreement with amersham biosciences 
under the terms of the agreement amersham biosciences serves as our exclusive distributor  marketer and seller of a majority of the product of our biochrom subsidiary 
this agreement has a five year finite life and may be terminated by either party upon months prior written notice 
additionally  upon breach of certain terms of the agreement by either party  such as pricing  exclusivity  and delivery  the agreement may be terminated with a day notice period 
research and development our principal research and development mission is to develop a broad portfolio of technologies  assays  products and core competencies in drug discovery tools  particularly for application in the areas of target validation and admet 
our research and development expenditures were million excluding in process research and development charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to make significant development expenditures 
we plan to continue to pursue a balanced development portfolio strategy of originating new products from internal research and development programs and business and technology acquisitions 
we maintain development staff in most of our manufacturing facilities to design and develop new products 
in house development is focused on our current technologies 
as the result of the acquisition of union biometrica  we opened a european model organism laboratory in geel  belgium in the third quarter of this laboratory will focus on extending the use of and developing new applications for the copas technology 
for new technologies  our strategy has been to license or acquire proven technology from universities and biotechnology companies and then develop the technology into commercially viable products 
manufacturing we manufacture and test the majority of our products in our principal manufacturing facilities located in the united states  the united kingdom  austria and germany 
we have considerable manufacturing flexibility at our various facilities  and each facility can manufacture multiple products at the same time 
we maintain in house key manufacturing know how  technologies and resources 
we seek to maintain multiple suppliers for key components that are not manufactured in house 
our manufacturing operations are primarily to assemble and test 
our manufacturing of syringe pumps  ventilators  cell injectors and protein purification products takes place in holliston  massachusetts 
the manufacture of our cell biology and electrophysiology products takes place in our hamden  connecticut facility 
the copas technology instruments are manufactured in our somerville  massachusetts facility 
our mitoscan toxicology assay is manufactured in madison  wisconsin 
our manufacturing of spectrophotometers and amino acid analysis systems takes place in our cambridge  england facility which is certified to iso our manufacturing of surgery related products and teaching products takes place in edenbridge  england 
our manufacturing of complete organ testing systems takes place in march hugstetten  germany 
our electrophoresis products are manufactured at our warwickshire  england facility and our low volume  high throughput liquid dispensers and our plate readers are manufactured in our facility in eugendorf  austria 
competition the markets into which we sell our products are highly competitive  and we expect the intensity of competition to increase 
we compete with many companies engaged in developing and selling tools for drug discovery 
many of our competitors have greater financial  operational  sales and marketing resources  and more experience in research and development and commercialization than we have 
moreover  competitors may have greater name recognition than we do  and many offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
these competitors and other companies may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products which could render our products obsolete 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to make the enhancements to our technologies necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies 
we are not aware of any significant products sold by us which are currently obsolete 
we believe that we offer one of the broadest selections of target validation and screening technologies to companies engaged in drug discovery 
we are not aware of any competitor that offers a product line of comparable breadth within the target validation and screening product markets 
we have numerous competitors on a product line basis 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of product performance  including quality  reliability and speed  technical support  price and delivery time 
we compete with several companies that provide instruments for target validation and admet screening 
in the dna rna protein calculator area  we compete with perkinelmer instruments  inc and bio rad laboratories  inc 
in the molecular biology spectrophotometer area  we compete with beckman coulter  inc and perkinelmer instruments  inc 
in the protein sample preparation area  we compete with millipore corporation  pierce chemical company and spectrum medical 
in the admet screening area  we compete with kd scientific  razel scientific instruments  inc  experimetria ltd  kent scientific corporation  general valve company  eppendorf netheler hinz gmbh  ugo basile and becton dickinson and company 
in the area of oem products  we face competition primarily from the in house engineering teams of our oem customers 
intellectual property to establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products  we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts 
most of our new technology is covered by patents or patent applications 
most of our base business is protected by trade names and trade secrets only 
we have implemented a patent strategy designed to provide us with freedom to operate and facilitate commercialization of our current and future products 
we currently own eleven issued us patents and have eight pending applications 
we also hold exclusive licenses for the technologies used in our mitoscan high throughput toxicology products  our navicyte drug absorption products and our puretip pipette tip products 
in addition to these licenses  our principal technologies are covered by issued patents for our dialyzers and our ultra micro spin columns and by pending applications for our preptip pipette tips 
furthermore  international patent applications are pending in connection with one of our us patent applications and one of our licensed patents 
generally  us patents have a term of years from the date of issue for patents issued from applications filed with the us patent office prior to june   and years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date in the case of patents issued from applications filed on or after june  our issued us patents will expire between and our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies 
we intend to continue to file patent applications as we develop new products and technologies 
patents provide some degree of protection for our intellectual property 
however  the assertion of patent protection involves complex legal and factual determinations and is therefore uncertain 
the scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection 
in addition  our issued patents or patents licensed to us may be successfully challenged  invalidated  circumvented or unenforceable so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition  the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve  particularly in areas of interest to us 
as a result  there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us 
in view of these factors  our intellectual property positions bear some degree of uncertainty 
we also rely in part on trade secret protection of our intellectual property 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties  employees and consultants 
our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in patents and copyrights arising from their work for us 
many of our us employees have signed agreements not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and after termination of their employment  through the misuse of confidential information  soliciting employees  soliciting customers and the like 
however  it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated and if so  there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available 
despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure you that third parties will not independently discover or invent competing technologies  or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technologies 
therefore  the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
we do not believe that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party 
we cannot assure you  however  that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors with respect to current or future products 
we expect that product developers in our market will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our market segment grows and the product functionality in different market segments overlaps 
in addition  patents on production and business methods are becoming more common and we expect that more patents will be issued in our technical field 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
moreover  such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could seriously harm our business or financial condition 
government regulation we are not subject to direct governmental regulation other than the laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses in the domestic and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
in particular  we are not subject to regulatory approval by the united states food and drug administration as none of our products are sold for use in diagnostic procedures or on human clinical patients 
in addition  we believe we are in compliance with all relevant environmental laws 
employees as of december   we had full time employees and part time employees  of whom resided in the united states  of whom resided in the united kingdom  of whom reside in austria  of whom resided in germany  of whom resided in canada  of whom resided in belgium  of whom resided in france  of whom resided in the netherlands  and who resided in spain 
none of our employees is subject to any collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
item properties 
our eleven principal facilities incorporate manufacturing  development  sales and marketing  and administration functions 
our facilities consist of a leased  square foot facility in holliston  massachusetts  which is our corporate headquarters  a leased  square foot facility in cambridge  england  a leased  square foot facility in warwickshire  england  an owned  square foot facility in edenbridge  england  a leased  square foot facility in march hugstetten  germany  a leased  square foot facility in somerville  massachusetts  a leased  square foot facility in hamden  connecticut  a leased  square foot facility in eugendorf  austria  a leased  square foot facility in somerville  massachusetts  a leased  square foot facility in madison  wisconsin and a leased  square foot facility in geel  belgium 
we also lease additional facilities for sales and administrative support in les ulix  paris  france and montreal  quebec  canada 
item legal proceedings 
on december   harvard university filed a lawsuit in us district court  district of massachusetts alleging that our use of the harvard bioscience and harvard apparatus names infringes on harvard university s trademarks 
harvard university is seeking both injunctive relief and monetary damages 
we believe that these claims are without merit  and we are vigorously defending against such claims 
on april   the us district court  district of massachusetts denied harvard university s request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting us from using the names harvard bioscience and harvard apparatus 
the court did issue an order directing us not to use the harvard name in the color crimson or in a font similar to the font used by harvard university 
we believe that the defense of these claims could involve significant litigation related expenses  but that defense of these claims and compliance with the court order will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
on february   paul d 
grindle  the former owner of harvard apparatus  inc  initiated an arbitration proceeding against the company and certain directors before jams  an arbitration firm in boston  massachusetts 
mr grindle s claims arise out of post closing purchase price adjustments related to the company s purchase of the assets and business of harvard apparatus by virtue of an asset purchase agreement dated march  and certain related agreements 
in the arbitration demand  mr 
grindle sought the return of  shares of stock in the company  or the disgorgement of the profits of the company s sale of the stock  as well as punitive damages and attorney s fees under mass 
gen 
laws  chapter a 
in a demand letter that was attached to the arbitration demand  mr 
grindle asserted losses in the amount of million  representing the value of the  shares of the company s stock as of january  the company believes that mr 
grindle s claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously 
the company also believes that mr 
grindle s claims are barred by the terms of certain releases executed by him and further barred by the applicable statutes of limitation 
from time to time  we may be involved in various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are not currently a party to any other claims or proceedings which  we believe  if decided adversely to us  would either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

overview we are a provider of innovative  enabling tools for drug discovery research at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and government research laboratories 
we focus on critical bottlenecks in the drug discovery process target validation  assay development and admet screening 
our admet screening products enable our customers to test drug candidates to determine their absorption  distribution  metabolism  elimination and toxicology properties prior to conducting costly clinical trials 
in providing tools for drug discovery generally  we have established a significant base business and have achieved brand recognition through our sale of precision pumps  ventilators  tissue organ systems  cell biology and electrophysiology products 
since  we have built upon our base business and brand recognition by adding new technologies in the areas of target validation  assay development and admet screening 
specifically  we have acquired the following product lines  businesses and technologies in june  we acquired products for cell injection systems from medical systems corporation for million in cash  in february  we acquired biochrom ltd  which develops and manufactures dna rna protein calculators  spectrophotometers  amino acid analyzers and related consumables in the united kingdom  from pharmacia biotech biochrom ltd for million in cash  in march  we entered into an exclusive license for the technology underlying our scantox in vitro toxicology testing product for  in cash and ongoing royalties and licensing fee payments  in september  we acquired products for intracellular research from clark electromedical instruments for  in cash  in november  we acquired our navicyte diffusion chamber systems product for drug absorption testing from a subsidiary of trega biosciences for  in cash and future royalties  in november  we acquired substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of hugo sachs elektronik  consisting primarily of products for organ testing  for  in cash  in may  we acquired certain assets of biotronik  consisting primarily of products for amino acid analysis  for  in cash  in july  we acquired substantially all the assets of amika corporation consisting of purification tips  spin columns  a well drug binding assay and related technology and intellectual property for million in cash  in december  we acquired substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of mitoscan corporation  a company that produces tools for toxicity testing for  in cash and future milestone payments and royalties  in may  we acquired substantially all the assets of warner instruments corporation  a company that designs  produces and markets electro physiology products for approximately million in cash  in may  we acquired all the outstanding stock of union biometrica  inc for a combination of cash and stock of approximately million 
union biometrica invented  developed and initiated marketing of copas  high throughput  high relevance model organism screening systems  in june  for cash of approximately million  we acquired through harvard apparatus  ltd  one of our united kingdom subsidiaries  substantially all the assets of international market supply ltd  a company that produces and markets anesthesiology products  in november  for cash of approximately million  we acquired scie plas ltd 
for its electrophoresis based sample preparation products and in december  for cash of approximately million  we acquired asys hitech gmbh for its plate readers and low volume liquid dispensers 
revenues 
we generate revenues by selling instruments  devices and consumables through our catalog  our direct sales force  our distributors and our website 
every one to three years  we intend to distribute a new  comprehensive catalog initially in a series of bulk mailings  first to our existing customers  followed by mailings to targeted markets of potential customers 
over the life of the catalog  distribution will also be made periodically to potential and existing customers through direct mail and trade shows and in response to telephone inquiries 
from time to time  we also intend to distribute catalog supplements that promote selected areas of our catalog or new products to targeted subsets of our customer base 
future distributions of our comprehensive catalog and our catalog supplements will be determined primarily by the incidence of new product introductions  which cannot be predicted 
our customers are end user research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and government laboratories 
revenue from catalog sales in any period is a function of time elapsed since the last mailing of the catalog  the number of catalogs mailed and the number of new items included in the catalog 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from products we manufacture or from collaboration and research grant projects 
the remaining of our revenues were derived from complementary products we distribute in order to provide the researcher with a single source for all equipment needed to conduct a particular experiment 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived through catalog sales and through reference to our website  which is an electronic version of our catalog 
we do not currently have the capability to accept purchase orders through our website 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from sales made by our non us operations 
a majority of our international sales during this period consisted of sales to amersham biosciences  the distributor for our spectrophotometers  amino acid analyzers and plate readers 
amersham biosciences distributes these products to customers around the world from its distribution center in upsalla  sweden  including to many customers located in the united states 
as a result  we believe our international sales would have been less as a percentage of our revenues for the year ended december  if we had shipped our products directly to our end users 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  obsolescence charges  packaging costs  warranty costs  shipping costs and royalties 
our costs of product revenues may vary over time based on the mix of products sold 
we sell products that we manufacture and products that we purchase from third parties 
the products that we purchase from third parties have higher cost of goods sold because the profit is effectively shared with the original manufacturer 
we anticipate that our manufactured products will continue to have a lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues as compared with the cost of non manufactured products for the foreseeable future 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology and human relations functions 
other costs include facility costs  professional fees for legal and accounting services  insurances and provision for doubtful accounts 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in sales  marketing and customer support functions 
we also incur costs for trade shows  demonstration equipment  public relations and marketing materials  consisting primarily of the printing and distribution of our  page catalog and supplements  and the maintenance of our web sites 
we may from time to time expand our marketing efforts by employing additional technical marketing specialists in an effort to increase sales of selected categories of products in our catalog 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel and capital resources used to develop and enhance our products and to support collaboration agreements 
other research and development expense includes fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  and material costs for prototype and test units 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue to make these investments in order to realize the potential of new technologies that we develop  license or acquire 
stock compensation expense 
stock compensation resulting from stock option grants to our employees represents the difference between the fair market value and the exercise price of the stock options on the grant date for those options considered fixed awards 
stock compensation expense is also recorded for stock option grants that were considered variable awards because the number of shares to be acquired by employees was indeterminable at the date of grant 
stock compensation on fixed awards is amortized as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the options 
common stock warrant interest expense 
on march   in connection with the issuance of redeemable preferred stock and subordinated debentures   common stock warrants were issued 
the related common stock warrant interest expense represented an accrual of a liability to warrant holders that would have required us to pay cash equal to the fair market value of the warrants in exchange for the warrants  or any common stock from the exercise of the warrants  beginning march  effective with our initial public offering of common stock in december  the warrants were exercised for common stock and  as a result  the right to be paid cash terminated 
our business has historically been affected by a number of factors that cause revenue and earnings to vary from quarter to quarter  including catalog mailings  new product introductions  and our substantial european business  which in summer months defers purchases and acquisitions 
as a result  we believe that revenue and earnings in one quarter of the year may not be indicative of revenue and earnings in a subsequent quarter 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows valuation of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development in business combinations  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  revenue recognition and inventory 
valuation of identifiable intangible assets in business combinations 
identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks  assembled workforce  and acquired technology 
such intangible assets arise from the allocation of purchase price of businesses acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair market value 
amounts assigned to such identifiable intangible assets are based on independent appraisals using established valuation techniques 
the value assigned to trademarks was determined by estimating the royalty income that would be negotiated at an arm s length transaction if the asset were licensed from a third party 
a discount factor  ranging from to  which represents both the business and financial risks of such investments  was used to determine the present value of the future streams of income attributable to trademarks 
the specific approach used to value trademarks was the relief from royalty rfr method 
the rfr method assumes that an intangible asset is valuable because the owner of the asset avoids the cost of licensing that asset 
the royalty savings are then calculated by multiplying a royalty rate times a determined royalty base  ie  the applicable level of future revenues 
in determining an appropriate royalty rate  a sample of guideline  arm s length royalty and licensing agreements are analyzed 
in determining the royalty base  forecasts are used based on management s judgments of expected conditions and expected courses of actions 
assembled workforce was valued by estimating the current cost necessary to create a similar replacement workforce including costs to recruit  hire and train 
the value assigned to acquired technology was determined by using a discounted cash flow model which measures what a buyer would be willing to pay currently for the future cash stream potential of existing technology 
the specific method used to value the technologies involved estimating future cash flows to be derived as a direct result of those technologies  and discounting those future streams to their present value 
the discount factors used  ranging from to  reflects the business and financial risks of an investment in technologies 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on managements judgment of expected conditions and expected courses of action 
valuation of in process research and development in business combinations 
purchase price allocation to in process research and development represents the estimated fair value of research and development projects that have no alternative future use 
the value assigned to in process research and development was determined by independent appraisal by estimating the cost to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially feasible products  estimating the percentage of completion at the acquisition date  estimating the resulting net risk adjusted cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the discount rates used in determining the in process research and development expenditure reflects a higher risk of investment because of the higher level of uncertainty due in part to the nature of the company and the industry to constantly develop new technology for future product releases and ranged from to 
the forecasts used by the company in valuing in process research and development were based on assumptions the company believes to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
given the uncertainties of the development process  no assurance can be given that deviations from the company s estimates will occur and no assurance can be given that the in process research and development projects identified will ever reach either technological or commercial success 
the amounts allocated in to in process research and development of  were expensed as of the acquisition dates 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we were to determine that the value of long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill were not recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the aforementioned factors  recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by an asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose 
in june  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets was issued 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other things  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but rather tested annually for impairment 
accordingly  the company adopted sfas no 
on january  and will cease to recognize approximately million of goodwill amortization expense in at december   the company has goodwill and intangibles with indefinite future lives of approximately million on its consolidated balance sheet 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the second quarter of accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves us estimating our current and deferred income tax expense as well as accounting for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the future tax consequences attributable to these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balances sheets 
we must assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to the extent we believe that recovery does not meet this more likely than not standard  we must establish a valuation allowance 
if a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period  we must allocate the related income tax expense to income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
to the extent a valuation is attributable to income tax benefits allocated to shareholders equity  the related valuation allowance must be allocated accordingly to stockholders equity 
management judgment is required in determining our income tax provision  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
at december   we have not established a valuation allowance as we believe that the deferred tax assets at december  will more likely than not be realized in the carryback and carryforward periods based on the criteria set forth in sfas  accounting for income taxes 
we will review the recoverability of deferred tax assets during each reporting period 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales generally upon shipment or installation  if applicable  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
the company has no obligations to customers after the date products are shipped or installed  if applicable  other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
the company provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue 
the company provides for the estimated amount of future returns upon shipment of products or installation  if applicable  based on historical experience 
while product returns and warranty costs have historically not been significant  they have been within our expectations and the provisions established  however  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same return rates and warranty repair costs that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the cost to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or increased costs materialize 
the company makes estimates evaluating its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically not been significant  they have been within our expectations and the provisions established  however  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventory 
the company values its inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase first in  first out method and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost  based primarily on its estimated forecast of product 
since forecasted product demand quite often is a function of previous and current demand  a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  the company s industry is subject to technological change and new product development  and technological advances could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and its reported operating results 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in approximately million of the million increase  or  represented the base revenues  revenues stream prior to acquisition  for the acquisitions made in and the full period effect of base revenues from acquisitions made in the balance of the increase was from existing businesses that introduced new products including new lines of spectrophotometers and plate readers and from the leveraged growth in acquisitions

research and development spending was million in  million of which resulted from acquisitions 
excluding the acquired research and development programs  spending in was approximately million  basically unchanged from spending in as a percentage of revenues  research and development was in compared to in this higher level resulted primarily from the acquisition of union biometrica  which  as an early stage commercial technology company  spends a higher percentage of revenues on research and development than our traditional businesses 
the union biometrica acquisition is expected to result in research and development spending at a higher level as a percentage of revenues than we have traditionally experienced 
in process research and development expense 
as of the date of the acquisitions of warner instruments and union biometrica  we recorded  and million respectively of in process research and development expense representing the estimated fair value of acquired research and development projects with no alternative future use 
stock compensation expense 
we recorded million of stock compensation expense in the twelve months ended december  we will recognize approximately million of additional expense over the remaining vesting life of the options

the liability previously recorded became part of common stock and additional paid in capital 
net interest income for was million compared to net interest expense of  in net interest income for was the result of interest earned on the proceeds from our december initial public offering and the underwriters exercise of the over allotment in january the net interest expense resulted primarily from debt  which was incurred to finance acquisitions  partially offset by interest income on proceeds from the initial public offering 
foreign currency loss in decreased approximately  to  due primarily to a decline in dollar denominated debt in foreign subsidiaries and to less unfavorable exchange rates during income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rates were for and for not withstanding the effects of the nondeductible in process research and development charges for  certain stock compensation expense and certain amortization of goodwill and intangibles for and  and common stock warrant interest expense for the increase in the income tax rate was principally due to increased taxable income in jurisdictions that have higher statutory income tax rates  primarily in germany 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in approximately million of the million increase  or  was attributable to the full period effect of revenues from the acquisition of our hugo sachs subsidiary in november approximately million of the increase was from existing business revenue growth and the balance was from product line acquisitions made in the second half of revenues for would have been approximately million if our sales denominated in foreign currencies were translated into us dollars using exchange rates  an increase of over cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  cost of product revenues was virtually unchanged for compared to general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in from million in due primarily to increased headcount and additional expenses related to being a public company as well as the full period effect of the biochrom subsidiary which was acquired in february as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expense increased to in from in sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to additional sales and marketing expenses incurred in acquired businesses and to a lesser extent the addition of marketing personnel and additional catalog costs

the increase in the rate was principally due to increased taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions that have higher statutory income tax rates  primarily in germany 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our business through cash provided by operating activities  the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  and bank borrowings 
our liquidity requirements have arisen primarily from investing activities  including funding of acquisitions  payments on outstanding indebtedness  research and development expenditures  and capital expenditures 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
since  we have raised million  consisting of million of preferred and common stock issued in private placements or upon exercise of stock options and warrants  million of debt and million from issuance of common stock in our initial public offering in december and the subsequent exercise of the underwriters over allotment in january upon receipt of the initial public offering proceeds on december   we repaid all debt and redeemed all outstanding preferred stock 
our operating activities generated cash of million in  million in and million in for all periods presented  operating cash flows were primarily due to operating results  including the full year effect of acquisitions prior to non cash charges  partially offset by working capital requirements 
working capital requirements were affected by acquisitions  which increased accounts receivable and inventory carrying amounts partially offset by increased amounts in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our investing activities used cash of million in  million in and million in cash has been used in the following technology and business acquisitions million for asys hitech gmbh in december  million for scie plas ltd 
in november  million for ims in june  million for union biometrica  inc in may  million for warner instruments corporation in may   for substantially all the assets of mitoscan corporation in december  million for substantially all the assets of amika corporation in july   for biotronik s amino acid analysis systems business in may   for the navicyte diffusion chamber systems product line in november   for hugo sachs elektronik in november   for intracellular research products from clark electromedical instruments in september and million for biochrom in february our financing activities have historically consisted of borrowings under a revolving credit facility  long term debt and the issuance of preferred stock and common stock  including the common stock issued in our initial public offering 
financing activities provided cash of million in and million in  and million in prior to  we had historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund expenditures on capital equipment  debt service  equity transactions  stock repurchases and preferred dividend payments 
in  in connection with the acquisition of biochrom  we increased our long term indebtedness by approximately million and issued approximately million in convertible preferred stock 
as a result  the level of debt service required increased substantially compared to historical levels 
upon completion of the initial public offering  the convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock and we used million of the offering proceeds to redeem our series a redeemable preferred stock and million to repay the bank term loan  the subordinated debt and the revolving credit facility 
based on our operating plans  we expect that the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  however  we may use substantial amounts of capital to accelerate product development  expand our sales and marketing activities or make acquisitions 
we may need to raise additional capital to the extent that we exhaust our available capital through these activities 
additional capital raising activities may be dilutive to existing stockholders to the extent we raise capital by issuing equity securities 
moreover  additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital 
disclosures about contractual obligations the following schedule represents our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period contractual obligation total and beyond long term debt capital leases operating leases total impact of foreign currencies we sell our products in many countries and a substantial portion of our sales  costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  especially the united kingdom pound sterling and the euro 
for fiscal years and  the us dollar strengthened against these currencies resulting in reduced consolidated revenue and earnings growth  as expressed in us dollars as well as  resulting in reduced foreign equity as expressed in us dollars 
for fiscal years and  the loss associated with the translation of foreign equity into us dollars was approximately  and  respectively 
in addition  the currency fluctuations resulted in foreign currency losses of approximately  in and  in related primarily to dollar denominated debt at our foreign subsidiaries 
historically  we have not hedged our foreign currency position 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
however  as our sales expand internationally  we plan to evaluate our currency risks and we may enter into foreign exchange contracts from time to time to mitigate foreign currency exposure 
backlog our order backlog was approximately million as of december  and million as of december  we include in backlog only those orders for which we have received valid purchase orders 
purchase orders may be cancelled at any time prior to shipment 
our backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
we typically ship our backlog at any given time within days

our business strategy depends on our successfully developing and commercializing our new target validation and admet screening technologies to meet our customers expanding needs and demands  an example of which is the copas tm technology obtained from our acquisition of union biometrica 
market acceptance of this and other new products will depend on many factors  including the extent of our marketing efforts and our ability to demonstrate to existing and potential customers that our technologies are superior to other technologies and products that are available now or may become available in the future 
if our new products do not gain market acceptance  it could materially adversely affect our business and future growth prospects 
our products compete in markets that are subject to rapid technological change  and therefore one or more of our products could be made obsolete by new technologies 
because the market for drug discovery tools is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions  our product lines may be made obsolete unless we are able to continually improve our existing products and develop new products 
to meet the evolving needs of our customers  we must continually enhance our current and planned products and develop and introduce new products 
however  we may experience difficulties that may delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements 
in addition  our product lines are based on complex technologies that are subject to rapid change as new technologies are developed and introduced in the marketplace 
we may have difficulty in keeping abreast of the rapid changes affecting each of the different markets we serve or intend to serve 
our failure to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing technology  market demands or the requirements of our customers could cause our product sales to decline  and we could experience significant losses 
we offer and plan to offer a broad product line and have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses for development of new products and enhanced versions of our existing products 
the speed of technological change in our market may prevent us from being able to successfully market some or all of our products for the length of time required to recover development costs 
failure to recover the development costs of one or more products or product lines could decrease our profitability or cause us to experience significant losses 
we have limited experience in manufacturing some of our products that could cause problems or delays resulting in lost revenue 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner  our relationships with our customers could be seriously harmed  and our revenue could decline 
to achieve the production levels necessary for successful commercialization  we will need to scale up our manufacturing facilities and in some cases establish automated manufacturing methods and quality control procedures 
we cannot assure you that manufacturing or quality control problems will not arise as we attempt to scale up our production or that we can scale up manufacturing and quality control in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable costs 
if we are unable to manufacture these products consistently on a timely basis because of these or other factors  we may not achieve the level of sales from these products that we otherwise anticipate 
if amersham biosciences formerly amersham pharmacia biotech terminates its distribution agreement with us or fails to perform its obligations under our distribution agreement  it could impair the marketing and distribution efforts for some of our products and result in lost revenues 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were generated through an agreement with amersham biosciences  which was renegotiated in august  under which amersham biosciences acts as our primary marketing and distribution channel for the products of our biochrom subsidiary 
under the terms of this agreement  we are restricted from allowing another person or entity to distribute  market and sell the majority of the products of our biochrom subsidiary 
we are also restricted from making or promoting sales of the majority of the products of our biochrom subsidiary to any person or entity other than amersham biosciences or its authorized sub distributors 
we have little or no control over amersham biosciences marketing and sales activities or the use of its resources 
amersham biosciences may fail to purchase sufficient quantities of products from us or perform appropriate marketing and sales activities 
the failure by amersham biosciences to perform these activities could materially adversely affect our business and growth prospects during the term of this agreement 
in addition  our inability to maintain our arrangement with amersham biosciences for product distribution  could materially impede the growth of our business and our ability to generate sufficient revenue 
our agreement with amersham biosciences may be terminated with day notice under some circumstances  including in the event of a breach of a material term by us 
this agreement has a five year term  however  it may be terminated in accordance with its terms by either party upon months prior written notice 
while we believe our relationship with amersham biosciences is good  we cannot guarantee that the contract will be renewed or that amersham biosciences will aggressively market our products in the future 
we may be adversely affected by litigation involving harvard university 
on december   harvard university filed a lawsuit in us district court  district of massachusetts alleging that our use of the harvard bioscience and harvard apparatus names infringes on harvard university s trademarks 
harvard university is seeking both injunctive relief and monetary damages 
we believe that these claims are without merit  and we are vigorously defending against such claims 
on april   the us district court  district of massachusetts denied harvard university s request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting harvard bioscience from using the names harvard bioscience and harvard apparatus 
the court did issue an order directing harvard bioscience not to use the harvard name in the color crimson or in a font similar to the font used by harvard university 
we believe that the defense of these claims could involve significant litigation related expenses  but that it will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if claims for injunctive relief or other damages are decided against us  we could suffer monetary damages  lose our ability to use the names harvard bioscience and harvard apparatus  lose the reputation and goodwill associated with these names and ultimately experience decreased revenues and earnings in subsequent periods 
we may be adversely affected by litigation involving paul d 
grindle 
on february   paul d 
grindle  the former owner of harvard apparatus  inc  initiated an arbitration proceeding against the company and certain directors before jams  an arbitration firm in boston  massachusetts 
mr grindle s claims arise out of post closing purchase price adjustments related to the company s purchase of the assets and business of harvard apparatus by virtue of an asset purchase agreement dated march  and certain related agreements 
in the arbitration demand  mr 
grindle sought the return of  shares of stock in the company  or the disgorgement of the profits of the company s sale of the stock  as well as punitive damages and attorney s fees under mass 
gen 
laws  chapter a 
in a demand letter that was attached to the arbitration demand  mr 
grindle asserted losses in the amount of million  representing the value of the  shares of the company s stock as of january  the company believes that mr 
grindle s claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously 
the company also believes that mr 
grindle s claims are barred by the terms of certain releases executed by him and further barred by the applicable statutes of limitation 
we believe that the defense of these claims could involve significant litigation related expenses  but that it will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if claims for injunctive relief or other damages are decided against us  we could suffer monetary damages 
our competitors and potential competitors may develop products and technologies that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products 
we expect to encounter increased competition from both established and development stage companies that continually enter our market 
we anticipate that these competitors will include companies developing and marketing life sciences research tools  health care companies that manufacture laboratory based tests and analyzers  diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  and companies developing drug discovery technologies 
currently  our principal competition comes from established companies that provide products that perform many of the same functions for which we market our products 
our competitors may develop or market products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  operational  marketing and technical resources than we do 
moreover  these competitors may offer broader product lines and tactical discounts  and may have greater name recognition 
in addition  we may face competition from new entrants into our field 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
if we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property  third parties may use our technology  which would impair our ability to compete in our markets 
our continued success will depend in significant part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for our products throughout the world 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
we own eleven us patents and have eight patent applications pending in the us we also own numerous us registered trademarks and trade names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending 
we rely on patents to protect a significant part of our intellectual property and to enhance our competitive position 
however  our presently pending or future patent applications may not issue as patents  and any patent previously issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
furthermore  the claims in patents which have been issued or which may be issued to us in the future may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar to our products 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology  our ability to be commercially competitive will be materially impaired 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we generally seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners upon the commencement of a relationship with us 
however  we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances 
in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information  these agreements  even if obtained  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information 
in addition  adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information 
the loss or exposure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that would be expensive and time consuming 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties 
we may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions 
several of our products are based on patents that are closely surrounded by patents held by competitors or potential competitors 
as a result  we believe there is a greater likelihood of a patent dispute than would be expected if our patents were not closely surrounded by other patents 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property suits  interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings would be costly and divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities 
we may not prevail in any of these suits 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
for example  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
securities analysts or investors may perceive these announcements to be negative  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others 
we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others  including the patent rights  trademarks and trade names of third parties 
intellectual property litigation is costly and the outcome is uncertain 
if we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity  or obtain a license to or design around the intellectual property in question 
if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms  or are unable to design around any third party patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products and services  which could result in reduced revenue 
amika corporation  whose assets we purchased in july  received and responded to correspondence from counsel to a third party competitor regarding the possible infringement by it of a patent and other pending patent applications held by such third party 
because this competitor has not pursued this matter since amika s reply on june  in which amika stated that it did not believe it was infringing on this competitor s patents  we believe that this matter has been concluded 
however  we cannot assure you that this third party competitor will not assert these or similar claims in the future 
we do not currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from products which depend on the intellectual property related to this alleged infringement 
changes in accounting for goodwill amortization may have a material adverse affect on us 
we have historically amortized goodwill purchased in our acquisitions on a straight line basis ranging from to years 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from acquisitions after june  and existing as of december  will not be amortized  but instead will be evaluated annually to determine whether any portion of the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
if it is determined in the future that a portion of our goodwill is impaired  we will be required to write off that portion of our goodwill which could have an adverse effect on our net income for the period in which the write off occurs 
at december   we had unamortized goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of approximately million  or of total assets 
we are dependent upon our licensed technologies and may need to obtain additional licenses in the future to offer our products and remain competitive 
we have licensed key components of our technologies from third parties 
while we do not currently derive a material portion of our revenue from products that depend on these licensed technologies  we may in the future 
if our license agreements were to terminate prematurely or if we breach the terms of any licenses or otherwise fail to maintain our rights to these technologies  we may lose the right to manufacture or sell our products that use these licensed technologies 
in addition  we may need to obtain licenses to additional technologies in the future in order to keep our products competitive 
if we fail to license or otherwise acquire necessary technologies  we may not be able to develop new products that we need to remain competitive 
many of our current and potential customers are from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and are subject to risks faced by those industries 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we expect that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies will continue to be our major source of revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are subject to risks and uncertainties that affect the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  such as pricing pressures as third party payers continue challenging the pricing of medical products and services  government regulation  ongoing consolidation and uncertainty of technological change  and to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries 
in particular  several proposals are being contemplated by lawmakers in the united states to extend the federal medicare program to include reimbursement for prescription drugs 
many of these proposals involve negotiating decreases in prescription drug prices or imposing price controls on prescription drugs 
if appropriate reimbursement cannot be obtained  it could result in our customers purchasing fewer products from us as they reduce their research and development expenditures 
in addition  we are dependent  both directly and indirectly  upon general health care spending patterns  particularly in the research and development budgets of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  as well as upon the financial condition of various governments and government agencies 
many of our customers  including universities  government research laboratories  private foundations and other institutions  obtain funding for the purchase of our products from grants by governments or government agencies 
there exists the risk of a potential decrease in the level of governmental spending allocated to scientific and medical research which could substantially reduce or even eliminate these grants 
if government funding necessary to purchase our products were to decrease  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business could be subject to the effects of a generally weakened global economy 
the global economy  including the us economy  is much weaker now than it has been in recent history  and as a result our business is subject to the associated risks 
we do not believe that our business has suffered materially from the recent economic downturn  however we cannot guarantee that it will not suffer in the future 
if the general condition of both the global economy and the us economy persists or worsens  we may experience parts shortages if our suppliers are negatively impacted by the weakened economy 
this may in turn cause us to lose revenues from not being able to supply products to our customers 
we may also experience a loss of revenues if our customers reduce spending in response to the state of the economy 
additionally  our stock price could be significantly impacted by a continued weakened or worsening economy simply by the nature of the market 
our business is subject to risks associated with significant acts of terrorism 
prior to september   acts of terrorism such as occurred on that day were unprecedented in the us and around the world 
since september   it has become evident that such acts are indeed possible and could cause significant disruption and harm  to not only our business  but to the businesses of all our customers and suppliers both within the us and around the rest of the world 
we cannot guarantee that another such event will not adversely impact our ability to continue to operate 
our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international revenues and operations 
since we manufacture and sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our revenues from our non us operations represented approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenues 
in addition  a number of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which resulted in a foreign current loss of approximately  and a reduction of foreign equity of approximately  for the year ended december   changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  including western europe  in particular  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws affecting our ability to expatriate profits  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  and unfavorable labor regulations applicable to our european operations  such as the unenforceability of non competition agreements in the united kingdom 
our quarterly revenues will likely be affected by various factors  including the seasonal nature of purchasing in europe and the timing of capital equipment purchases by customers 
our revenues may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including the timing of catalog mailings and new product introductions  future acquisitions and our substantial sales to european customers  who in summer months often defer purchases 
therefore  we expect our revenues from european sales to be lower during the summer season and as a result our quarter to quarter revenues will likely experience fluctuations 
with the acquisition of union biometrica in may  an increasing portion of our revenues may result from sales of relatively high priced products 
delays in receipt  manufacture  shipment or receivables collection of these relatively high priced products could lead to substantial variability in revenues  operating results and working capital requirements from quarter to quarter  which could adversely affect our stock price 
we may lose money when we exchange foreign currency received from international revenues into us dollars 
for the year ended december   approximately of our business was conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  which is our reporting currency 
as a result  currency fluctuations among the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
in the future  we may undertake to manage foreign currency risk through additional hedging methods 
we recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in managing foreign currency risk or in predicting the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
if we engage in any acquisition  we will incur a variety of costs  and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
our business strategy includes the future acquisition of businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
if we do undertake any acquisition  the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition 
future acquisitions could reduce our stockholders ownership and could cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to intangible assets 
if we fail to retain our key personnel and hire  train and retain qualified employees  we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in reduced revenue 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of key management  technical and scientific personnel 
our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team  including our chief executive officer  chane graziano  and our president  david green  or any of our technical or scientific staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development and other business objectives 
we maintain key person life insurance on messrs 
graziano and green 
our future success will also depend on our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the technology area is intense  and we operate in several geographic locations where labor markets are particularly competitive  including boston  massachusetts and london and cambridge  england  and where demand for personnel with these skills is extremely high and is likely to remain high 
as a result  competition for qualified personnel is intense  particularly in the areas of information technology  engineering and science and the process of hiring suitably qualified personnel is often lengthy 
if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced 
we plan significant growth  and there is a risk that we will not be able to manage this growth 
our success will depend on the expansion of our operations 
effective growth management will place increased demands on our management  operational and financial resources 
to manage our growth  we must expand our facilities  augment our operational  financial and management systems  and hire and train additional qualified personnel 
our failure to manage this growth effectively could impair our ability to generate revenue or could cause our expenses to increase more rapidly than revenue  resulting in operating losses 
because our stock price may become highly volatile  our stock price could experience substantial declines and our management s attention may be diverted from more productive tasks 
the market price of our common stock may become volatile and could decline  perhaps substantially  in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies  revenues and operating results fluctuating or failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates  conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  announcements by us of significant acquisitions or financings or changes in strategic partnerships and a decrease in the demand for our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the biotechnology industry market in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that at times have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of our management s attention and resources 
provisions of delaware law and of our charter and by laws may make a takeover more difficult which could cause our stock price to decline 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and in the delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt which is opposed by our management and board of directors 
public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
we also have a staggered board of directors that makes it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to change our management and board of directors 
such provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources and the net proceeds from our initial public offering will enable us to maintain currently planned operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we premise this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors  including market acceptance of our new products and future opportunities with collaborators 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise capital could seriously harm our business and product development efforts 
if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity linked securities  existing percentages of ownership in the company will be reduced 
in addition  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding stock 
we may issue securities that have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products  or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable to us 
we may be unable to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us 
if future financing is not available to us or is not available on terms acceptable to us  we may have to curtail or cease operations 
future issuance of our preferred stock may dilute the rights of our common stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  privileges and other terms of these shares 
the board of directors may exercise this authority without any further approval of our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of future holders of our preferred stock 
cash dividends will not be paid on our common stock 
we intend to retain all of our earnings to finance the expansion and development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be our stockholders sole source of gain for the foreseeable future 
an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained 
although our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market  an active trading market for our shares may not be sustained 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manufacture and test the majority of products in research centers in the united states  the united kingdom  germany and austria 
we sell our products globally through our direct catalog sales  direct sales force and indirect distributor channels 
as a result  our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we collect amounts representing a substantial portion of our revenues and pay amounts representing a substantial portion of our operating expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect our operating results 
historically  we have not hedged our foreign currency position 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
however  as our sales expand internationally  we plan to evaluate currency risks and we may enter into foreign exchange contracts from time to time to mitigate foreign currency exposure
