item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset management 
in addition to providing manufacturers and publishers with one of the largest bases of resellers in the united states  canada  the caribbean  latin america  europe and the middle east  tech data also offers manufacturers and publishers the opportunity to participate in a number of special promotions  training programs and marketing services targeted to the needs of its resellers 
with the exception of hewlett packard company hp and compaq computer corporation compaq  no single vendor accounted for more than of tech data s net sales during fiscal   or sales of hp products accounted for   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively  and sales of compaq products accounted for   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
on march and   hp s and compaq s shareholders  respectively  voted to approve a merger of the two entities 
a member of hp s board of directors is contesting the vote 
based on the limited information currently available  the impact of this merger  should it occur  cannot at this time be estimated by tech data s management 
tech data s business could be adversely impacted should the merged company decide to bypass the distribution channel and increase the level of business it transacts directly with end users 
customers  products and services the company sells more than  microcomputer products including peripherals  systems  networking and software purchased directly from manufacturers and publishers in large quantities for sale to an active reseller base of more than  value added resellers vars  corporate resellers  direct marketers  retailers and internet resellers 
the market for vars  which constituted approximately of tech data s net sales in fiscal  is attractive because vars generally rely on distributors as their principal source of computer products and financing 
this reliance is due to vars typically not having the resources to establish a large number of direct purchasing relationships or stock significant product inventories 
direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers may establish direct relationships with manufacturers and publishers for their more popular products  but utilize distributors as the primary source for other product requirements and the alternative source for products acquired directly 
tech data also has developed special programs to meet the unique needs of direct marketers  retailers and internet resellers  which constituted approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal corporate resellers constituted approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal no single customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales during fiscal   or the company pursues a strategy of continually strengthening its product line to offer its customers a broad assortment of the latest technology products 
from time to time  the demand for certain products sold by the company exceeds the supply available from the manufacturer or publisher 
in such cases  the company generally receives an allocation of the available products 
management believes that the company s ability to compete is not adversely affected by these periodic shortages and the resulting allocations 
tech data provides resellers a high level of service through the company s pre and post sale technical support  suite of electronic commerce tools including web order entry and edi services  customized shipping documents  product configuration integration services and flexible financing programs 
the company delivers products throughout the united states  canada  the caribbean  latin america  europe and the middle east from its regionally located logistics centers 
locating logistics centers near its customers enables the company to deliver products on a timely basis  thereby reducing the customers need to invest in inventory 
see item properties for further discussion of the company s locations and logistics centers 
sales and electronic commerce currently  the company s sales force consists of approximately  field and inside telemarketing sales representatives 
field sales representatives are located in major metropolitan areas 
each field representative is supported by inside telemarketing sales teams covering a designated territory 
the company s team concept provides a strong personal relationship between representatives of the customers and tech data 
territories with no field representation are serviced exclusively by the inside telemarketing sales teams 
customers typically call their inside sales teams on dedicated toll free numbers or contact the company through various electronic methods to place orders 
if the product is in stock and the customer has available credit  customer orders are generally shipped the same day from the logistics facility nearest the customer 
increasingly  customers rely upon the company s electronic ordering and information systems  in addition to its product catalogs and frequent mailings  as sources for product information  including availability and price 
the company s on line computer system allows the inside sales teams to check for current stocking levels in each of the six united states logistics centers 
likewise  inside sales teams in canada  the caribbean  latin america  europe and the middle east can check on stocking levels in their respective logistics centers 
through the company s website  most customers can gain remote access to the company s information systems to check product availability and pricing and to place orders 
certain of the company s larger customers have available edi services whereby orders  order acknowledgments  invoices  inventory status reports  customized pricing information and other industry standard edi transactions are consummated on line  which improves efficiency and timeliness for both the company and its customers 
during fiscal  approximately billion of the company s worldwide sales dollar volume originated from orders received electronically  up from approximately in fiscal the company provides comprehensive training to its field and inside sales representatives regarding technical characteristics of products and the company s policies and procedures 
in addition  the company s ongoing training program is supplemented by product seminars offered by manufacturers and publishers 
competition tech data operates in a market characterized by intense competition  based upon such factors as product availability  credit availability  price  delivery and various services and support provided by the distributor to the customer 
the company believes that it is equipped to compete effectively with other distributors in all of these areas 
tech data competes against several companies in the north american market  including ingram micro and synnex 
in latin america  tech data competes against ingram micro and several regional and local distributors 
competition outside of the americas includes ingram micro  actebis and a variety of smaller regional and local distributors 
the company also competes with manufacturers and publishers who sell directly to resellers and end users 
the company nevertheless believes that in the majority of cases  manufacturers and publishers choose to sell products through distributors rather than directly because of the relatively small volume and high selling costs associated with numerous small orders 
management also believes that the company s prompt delivery of products and efficient handling of returns provide an important competitive advantage over manufacturers and publishers efforts to market their products directly 
employees on january   the company had approximately  employees located as follows united states  europe  and all other regions certain of the company s employees in canada are subject to collective bargaining or similar arrangements  as well as employees in various countries outside the united states that have laws providing representation rights to employees on management boards 
the company considers its relations with its employees to be good 
foreign and domestic operations and export sales tech data operates predominantly in a single industry segment as a wholesale distributor of computer based technology products and services 
therefore  the principal markets  products and services and methods of distribution from which each segment derives its revenues are essentially the same 
the principal geographical areas in which the company operates are the united states  europe including the middle east and other international areas which include in country operations in canada  brazil  argentina  chile  peru  uruguay and export sales to latin america and the caribbean from the united states 
in fiscal   and   and  respectively  of the company s sales were derived from sales outside of the united states 
tech data intends to either close or sell its operations in norway and potentially one other country during the first half of fiscal charges and operating losses from exiting these markets are estimated to range from to million

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations foreword certain statements within this item and throughout this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated herein are forward looking statements as described in the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from those projected 
please refer to the cautionary statements and important factors discussed in exhibit a for further information 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of cost and expenses to net sales derived from the company s consolidated statement of income for each of the three most recent fiscal years 
percentage of net sales year ended january  united states europe other international net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges note operating income interest expense  net net foreign currency exchange gain loss income before income taxes provision for income taxes income before minority interest minority interest net income fiscal years ended january  and consolidated net sales decreased to billion in fiscal compared to billion in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower demand for technology related products and services throughout the world and a weakening of the euro 
net sales from us operations fell to billion due primarily to economic weakness in the region 
on a local currency basis  european net sales decreased during the current year  and fell in us dollar terms due to a weakening of several european currencies against the us dollar 
other international sales fell in fiscal compared to the prior year due mostly to lower demand and a weaker currency in canada and latin america 
total international sales in fiscal represented approximately of consolidated net sales compared with in the prior year 
gross profit decreased million from the prior year to million in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal gross margins increased basis points to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase is attributable to the positive effects of the company s margin improvement programs and the aforementioned increase in the mix of international sales in fiscal  on which the company typically realizes higher gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this reduction in sg a is attributable to the company s highly variable cost structure and aggressive cost cutting measures taken to counter the effects of the economic downturn 
the company significantly reduced its payroll related costs as it managed its employee base down from approximately  employees at the end of fiscal to approximately  at the end of fiscal likewise  the company cut back dramatically on discretionary expenses such as travel related costs  consulting and supplies 
while these cost cutting measures were significant  they could not entirely offset the effect of the year over year sales decline and as a result sg a  as a percentage of net sales  increased basis points to from in the prior year 
the greater mix of international sales in fiscal also contributed to the higher sg a as a percentage of net sales  as the international model typically results in greater costs along with a higher gross margin as previously discussed above 
special charges of million were recognized in fiscal these special charges related to the company recording a the write off of previously capitalized software costs million  b the impairment of certain internet related investments million and  c the write off of development costs associated with a new german logistics center million  the construction of which has been indefinitely deferred 
the remaining internet related investment has a carrying value of approximately million at january  investments in these types of technologies are inherently risky and the company could lose the remainder of its investment 
in addition to those items mentioned above  operating income was negatively affected by operating losses in latin america of approximately million during the fourth quarter  these operating losses were primarily related to currency devaluation and asset realization issues in argentina and brazil 
as a result of the factors described above  operating income in fiscal decreased to million of net sales from million of net sales in fiscal interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is the result of a significant decrease in the company s average outstanding indebtedness and a decrease in rates 
the company was able to reduce its outstanding debt net of cash by over million during the past year due to dramatic improvements in its inventory management and the cash generated from other operating activities 
the company realized a net foreign currency exchange gain of million in fiscal compared to a gain of million in fiscal it continues to be the company s goal to minimize foreign currency exchange gains and losses through effective hedging techniques 
the company s foreign exchange policy prohibits speculative hedges 
the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is attributable to the decrease in taxable income during the year combined with a decrease in the company s effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the effective rate is primarily due to fluctuations and changes in the mix of taxable income within the company s various geographies and tax jurisdictions reported in each period 
as a result of the factors described above  net income in fiscal decreased to million per diluted share compared to million per diluted share in fiscal excluding special charges  net income decreased to million  or per diluted share in fiscal fiscal years ended january  and net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to billion in the prior year 
this increase is attributable to market share gains as well as the addition of new product lines and the expansion of existing product lines in all geographies 
us operations were especially strong  growing over the prior year as customers shifted business to the company due to our high level of execution and extensive service offerings 
worldwide sales growth would have been even greater in fiscal had the euro not devalued against the dollar 
on a local currency basis  europe actually grew if adjusted for the change in fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  however  when translated into us dollars  the region had growth 
in addition to the us and european growth  other international sales grew approximately over fiscal total international sales in fiscal represented approximately of consolidated net sales compared with in the prior year 
gross profit increased million over the prior year to billion in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross margins decreased basis points to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease is attributable to the aforementioned decrease in the mix of higher gross margin international sales relative to worldwide sales in large part due to the devaluation of the euro  competitive pressures  the company s higher mix of systems sales to total product sales and increased participation in customer outsourcing activities 
both of these latter businesses typically involve lower gross margins but provide acceptable operating and pre tax margins  because of cost and working capital efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal however  as a percentage of net sales  sg a actually decreased basis points to from in the prior year 
while the dollar value of sg a increased due to additional expenses required to support the increase in business  the decrease in sg a as a percentage of sales is attributable to the benefits realized by the company s ongoing focus on improving operating efficiencies as well as the significant economies of scale achieved during the past year  as the company effectively leveraged its investment in infrastructure and resources 
as a result of the factors described above  operating income in fiscal increased to million of net sales from million of net sales in fiscal interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is the result of an increase in the company s average outstanding indebtedness related to funding for continued growth and capital expenditures and an increase in average short term interest rates 
the company realized a net foreign currency exchange gain of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal this gain is largely due to the company realizing benefits from the strengthening euro during the fourth quarter of fiscal the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is attributable to the increase in taxable income during the year offset by a decrease in the company s effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the effective rate is primarily due to fluctuations and changes in the mix of taxable income within the company s various geographies and tax jurisdictions reported in each period 
as a result of the factors described above  net income in fiscal increased or million to million per diluted share compared to million per diluted share in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon tech data s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires tech data to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  tech data evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  vendor incentives  investments  fixed assets  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
tech data believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable tech data maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
in estimating the required allowance  tech data takes into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio  the existence of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks 
if actual customer performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected by tech data  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 
inventory tech data values its inventory at the lower of its cost or market value 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks  foreign currency fluctuations for foreign sourced product and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in the company s cost of sales 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 
vendor incentives the company receives incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other miscellaneous agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors  however  some of these incentives are negotiated on an ad hoc basis to support specific programs mutually developed by the company and the vendor 
cooperative advertising allowances are generally required by the vendor to be used by tech data exclusively for advertising or other marketing programs 
these restricted cooperative advertising allowances are recognized as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses as the related marketing expenses are incurred 
the company records unrestricted volume rebates received as a reduction of inventory and recognizes the incentives as a reduction to cost of sales when the related inventory is sold 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are deferred in the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  the company receives early payment discounts from certain of its vendors 
the company records early payment discounts received as a reduction of inventory and recognizes the discount as a reduction to cost of sales when the related inventory is sold 
intangible assets the company examines the carrying value of its excess of cost over fair value of acquired net assets goodwill and other intangible assets as current events and circumstances warrant to determine whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment were present in intangible assets used in operations and future cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified 
no event has been identified that would indicate an impairment of the value of goodwill recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
however  during fiscal  the company recorded a special charge of approximately million for certain of its software investments 
income taxes tech data records valuation allowances to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of recorded valuation allowances  tech data considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event the company determines it would be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should tech data determine that it is unable to use all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies the company accrues for contingent obligations  including estimated legal costs  when it is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include tax  legal and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports which are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas revises the standards of business combinations by eliminating the use of the pooling of interests method and requiring that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas also changes the criteria to recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill 
the provisions of sfas are effective for all business combinations initiated after june  the impact of adoption of this statement on the company s financial position and results of operations was not material 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas revises the standards of accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets by replacing the regular amortization of these assets with the requirement that they are reviewed annually for possible impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the accounting standards of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  application of the non amortization provisions of the statement is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately million 
per diluted share per year 
during the first quarter for the fiscal year ending january   the company finalized the required transitional impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under the requirements of sfas based on the results of the transitional impairment tests  tech data will not need to record any impairment for the adoption of this statement 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this statement supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
under the provisions of apb  a segment of a business to be disposed of was measured at the lower of its carrying amount or net realizable value  adjusted for expected future operating losses  whereas sfas used fair value less cost to sell and excludes future operating losses from the measurement 
sfas establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on the company s financial position and results of operations 
impact of inflation the company has not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition within the microcomputer industry has generally caused prices of the products sold by the company to decline 
management believes that most price increases could be passed on to its customers  as prices charged by the company are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to its customers 
quarterly data seasonality the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future as a result of seasonal variations in the demand for the products and services offered by the company 
the company s narrow operating margins may magnify the impact of these factors on the company s operating results 
specific historical seasonal variations in the company s operating results have included a reduction of demand in europe during the summer months  increased canadian government purchasing in the first quarter  and worldwide pre holiday stocking in the retail channel during the september to november period 
in addition  the product cycle of major products may materially impact the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations
