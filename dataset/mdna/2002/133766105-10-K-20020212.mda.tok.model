item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to those set forth under certain factors that may affect our business and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading provider of software solutions and strategic consulting services that facilitate energy trading  transaction processing  risk management  and decision support within the north american and european wholesale energy markets 
we were organized as a limited liability company in april  and acquired zai net software  lp and caminus limited in may  positron energy consulting in november  dc systems  inc in july  nucleus corporation and nucleus energy consulting corporation collectively  nucleus in august  and altra software services  inc altra in november in february  we closed the initial public offering of million shares of our common stock  realizing net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
since our inception  through our acquisitions and internal growth  we have expanded our organization rapidly  particularly in marketing  sales  and research and development 
our full time employees increased from at december   to at december   and we intend to continue to increase our number of employees in we generate revenues from licensing our software products  providing related implementation services and support  and providing strategic consulting services 
we generally license one or more products to our customers  who typically receive perpetual licenses to use our products for a specified number of servers and concurrent users 
after the initial license  they may purchase licenses for additional products  servers and users as needed 
in addition  customers typically purchase professional services from us  including implementation and training services  and enter into renewable maintenance contracts that provide for software upgrades and technical support over a stated term  typically twelve months 
our strategic consulting practice provides energy market participants with strategic advice on how to operate in and profit from competitive energy markets 
customer payments under our software license agreements are non refundable 
payment terms generally require that a significant portion of the license fee is payable on delivery of the licensed product with the balance due in installments 
the company s critical accounting policies are those that relate to revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we sell our products through our direct sales forces in north america and europe 
also  our strategic consulting group  in addition to generating consulting fee revenue  assists in generating software sales leads 
our results of operations may experience seasonal fluctuations as customers and potential customers in our industry face budgetary pressures to invest in energy software before year end 
accordingly  we may tend to report higher revenues during the fourth quarter of the year and lower revenues during the first quarter 
revenues from customers outside the united states represented  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a significant portion of our international revenues has historically been derived from sales of our strategic consulting services and software products in the united kingdom 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations and commit significant management time and financial resources to developing our direct international sales channels 
international revenues may not  however  increase as a percentage of total revenues 
we were formed as a limited liability company in april until our initial public offering in january  we were not subject to federal and state income taxes  except for new york income taxes on limited liability companies 
during january  the limited liability company merged into caminus corporation  a delaware subchapter c corporation formed in september the adjustment to the income tax provision reflects the additional tax provision we would have recorded had we been a subchapter c corporation for due to our acquisition of nucleus and altra  along with the significant changes in our operations  the fluctuation of financial results  including financial data expressed as a percentage of revenues for all periods  does not necessarily provide a meaningful understanding of the expected future results of our operations 
the results of operations of nucleus and altra are included in our consolidated results of operations beginning august and december  respectively 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest and other income  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  charges related to acquired in process research and development  non cash compensation expense  expenses related to our initial public offering  and loss on office relocation 
ebitda is a non gaap measure commonly used by investors and analysts to analyze companies on the basis of operating performance  leverage and liquidity 
we present adjusted ebitda  which is also a non gaap measure  to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is an indicator of our operating profitability since it excludes items that are not directly attributable to our ongoing business operations 
however  adjusted ebitda relies upon our management s judgment to determine which items are directly attributable to our ongoing business operations and as such is subjective in nature 
adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity 
for information about cash flows or results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  please see our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
certain reclassifications were made to prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation format  including reclassifying amortization of acquired technology from operating expenses to cost of revenues 
results of operations the following table sets forth  except for cost of licenses  cost of software services  and cost of strategic consulting  which are expressed as a percentage of their related revenues  and amortization of acquired technology  which is expressed as a percentage of license revenues  the consolidated financial information expressed as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and the consolidated financial information for the periods presented are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report

we expect that our results of operations will fluctuate  and the price of our common stock could fall if quarterly results are lower than the expectations of securities analysts

 statement of operations data revenues licenses software services strategic consulting total revenues gross profit operating expenses operating income loss other income  net provision for income taxes net income loss liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations and acquisitions and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily from the proceeds of equity financings  borrowings  and  more recently  cash flow from operations 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments increased by million from million at december  to million at december  our working capital decreased by million from million at december  to million at december  our highly liquid assets consist of cash  cash equivalents and investments in short term marketable securities 
for the year ended december   our highly liquid assets increased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
net cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from the fact that results of operations included non cash depreciation and amortization of million  which more than offset our net loss of million 
our cash flow used in investing activities of million was primarily due to the cash used in the purchase of altra of million  and million of capital expenditures for computer and communications equipment  purchased software  office equipment  furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements partially offset by the net proceeds of sales of investments in marketable securities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  which included million received from the sale of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options 
in addition  in november  we entered into a term loan for million under a credit agreement to partially finance our acquisition of altra 
the term loan bears interest at for the first year  which increases to and during the second year  and is due on october  we expect that our working capital needs will continue to grow as we execute our growth strategy 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments  and cash anticipated to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
in the event we engage in acquisitions in the future  however  we may be required to raise additional equity capital or to incur indebtedness to fund the purchase price for such acquisitions 
we are not currently a party to any agreement or arrangement for any potential acquisition 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  sfas also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we adopted the provisions of sfas  effective july   and will adopt the provisions of sfas  effective january  furthermore  any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of sfas upon adoption of sfas  we will evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations  and will make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas  we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first quarter of in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas will require us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and to compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of our assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption  we expect to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas and sfas amortization expense related to goodwill was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on october   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of sfas sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in apb opinion no 
to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
by broadening the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions  the fasb has enhanced the ability of a company s management to provide information that helps financial statement users to assess the effects of a disposal transaction on the ongoing operations of such company 
we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
certain factors that may affect our business our quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially  which may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock  particularly if our quarterly results are lower than the expectations of securities analysts 
our revenues and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future 
these fluctuations may adversely affect our business  financial condition  and the market price of our common stock particularly if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of securities analysts 
a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause variations in our quarterly revenues and operating results  including changes in demand for our software solutions and strategic consulting services  the length of our sales cycle  and the timing and recognition of sales of our products and services  including the timing and recognition of significant product orders  unexpected delays in the development and introduction of new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  software development or other corporate activities  changes in the rapidly evolving market for products and services in the energy industry  the mix of our revenue during any period  particularly with respect to the breakdown between software license and services revenues  the hiring  retention and utilization of personnel  costs related to the integration of people  operations and products from previously acquired businesses and technologies and from future acquisitions  if any  and general economic conditions 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on our historical quarterly results as an indication of our future performance 
our sales cycle may be subject to seasonality  which could result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
we may experience seasonality in the sales of our software 
for instance  many of our current and potential customers in the energy industry face budgetary pressures to invest in energy software before the end of each fiscal year 
as a result  we may tend to report higher revenues during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and lower revenues during the first quarter of our fiscal year 
these seasonal variations in our sales may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which in turn may lead to volatility in the market price of our common stock 
substantial competition could reduce our market share and materially adversely affect our financial performance 
the market for products and services in the energy industry is very competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we currently face competition from a variety of sources  including energy software providers  in house development  large consultancies  enterprise software companies and providers of strategic consulting services 
some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  greater resources  and a higher number of established customer relationships than we have 
many of these competitors also have extensive knowledge of our industry 
as a result of these factors  some of our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products 
if we are not able to compete effectively  our business  results of operations  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may not be able to successfully manage the expansion of our operations 
we have experienced  and are currently experiencing  a period of significant growth 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulties managing our growth in the future 
future growth may place increased demands on our management  financial and operational resources 
in addition  as part of our growth  we will need to expand  train and manage our employee base and maintain close coordination within our organization 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our business  results of operations  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our future results may be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with international sales and operations 
because we sell and market our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenues from international operations will represent an increasing portion of our total revenues going forward 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including the need to comply with the laws and regulations of different countries  difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights in some countries  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the imposition of exchange or price controls or other restrictions on the conversion of foreign currencies  difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable and the existence of potentially longer payment cycles  the impact of possible recessions in economies outside the united states  and political and economic instability  including instability related to terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad 
if we are unable to minimize the risks associated with international sales and operations  our business  results of operations  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions  which could have an adverse impact on our business if unsuccessful 
we may from time to time acquire or invest in complementary companies  products or technologies 
for instance  in november  we acquired altra software services  inc from time to time  we may evaluate other acquisition opportunities that could provide us with additional product or services offerings or additional industry expertise 
these acquisitions  if any  may result in difficulties for us in assimilating acquired operations and products  and could result in the diversion of our capital and our management s attention from other business issues and opportunities 
for instance  the integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to the integration of technology and management teams 
we may not be able to successfully integrate operations  personnel or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future 
if we fail to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions  our business  results of operations  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our acquisitions may not be successful in achieving our desired strategic objectives  which would also cause our business to suffer 
acquisitions also may present other risks  such as exposing our company to potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
the pro forma financial information included in this annual report may not be representative of our results as a combined company 
the pro forma financial information included in this annual report combines our operating results with those of nucleus corporation and nucleus energy consulting corporation  companies we acquired in august  and altra software services  inc  a company we acquired in november this information may not reflect what our results of operations would have been had we been a combined entity during the periods presented  or what our results of operations will be in the future 
the pro forma financial information does not reflect many significant changes that have occurred or may occur in our operational arrangements as a combined entity 
accordingly  you should not rely on our pro forma financial information as an indication of our future operating results or financial performance 
if we fail to adapt to rapid changes in the energy market  our existing products could become obsolete 
the market for our products is marked by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands  and evolving industry standards and regulations 
we may not be able to successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements that comply with present or emerging technology standards 
also  any new regulations or technology standards could increase our cost of doing business 
new products based on new technologies or new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
to succeed  we will need to enhance our current products and develop new products on a timely basis to keep pace with developments related to the energy market and to satisfy the increasingly sophisticated requirements of our customers 
software addressing the trading  transaction processing  and risk management of energy assets is complex and can be expensive to develop  and new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
any delays in developing and releasing new or enhanced products could cause us to lose revenue opportunities and customers 
our software products may contain errors  which could damage our reputation  decrease market acceptance of our products  cause us to lose customers and revenue  and result in liability to us 
despite internal testing and testing by third parties  complex software products such as ours often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
serious defects or errors could result in lost revenues or a delay in market acceptance 
because our customers use our products for critical business applications  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in damage to our customers 
although our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims  these provisions could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal  state  local or foreign laws or regulations 
if a claim against us was successful  we might be required to incur significant expense and to pay substantial damages 
even if we were to prevail  the accompanying publicity could adversely affect the demand for our products 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  which could result in the use of our technology by competitors or other third parties 
our success depends in large part upon our proprietary technologies 
we rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret protection  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements  and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
we seek to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets through a number of means  including requiring those individuals with access to our proprietary information to enter into nondisclosure agreements with us and restricting access to our source code 
trade secret and copyright laws  under which we seek to protect our software  documentation  and other proprietary materials  provide only limited protection 
despite these efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may be successful in copying or otherwise obtaining and using our software 
in addition  other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other protective contracts that we have entered into with them  and we may not be able to enforce our rights in these circumstances 
any actions taken by us to enforce our intellectual property rights could result in significant expense to us as well as the diversion of management time and other resources 
in addition  detecting infringement and misappropriation of intellectual property can be difficult  and there can be no assurance that we would detect any infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights 
even if we are able to detect infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights  litigation to enforce our rights could cause us to divert significant financial and other resources from our business operations  and may not ultimately be successful 
moreover  we license our software internationally  and the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we are unable to rely on licenses of intellectual property from third parties  our ability to conduct our business could be harmed 
we rely on third party licensors for technology that is incorporated into  and is necessary for the operation of  some elements of our software 
our success will depend in part on our continued ability to have access to such technologies that are or may become important to the functionality of our products 
we cannot assure you  however  that such licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 
we could become subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights  which could limit our ability to conduct our business 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that  in the future  third parties may claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property 
energy software product developers may increasingly become subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the energy software industry grows and the functionality of products from different software developers overlaps 
parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction against us  which could prevent us from selling our products in the united states or in foreign countries 
any such injunction could significantly harm our business 
moreover  any infringement claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention  cause product shipment delays  force us to redesign or cease selling products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could materially adversely affect our business 
even if we ultimately are able to enter into royalty or license agreements  these agreements may require us to make payments that may adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  we may be obligated to indemnify customers against claims that we infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties 
we will need to recruit  train and retain sufficient qualified personnel in order to successfully expand our business 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to recruit and retain highly qualified technical  sales and marketing  and other personnel 
if we do not attract and retain such personnel  we may not be able to expand our business 
competition for qualified personnel is intense in the energy industry 
there are a limited number of people with the appropriate combination of skills needed to provide the services that our customers demand 
we expect competition for qualified personnel to remain intense  and we may not succeed in attracting or retaining sufficient personnel 
in addition  newly hired employees generally require substantial training  which requires significant resources and management attention 
even if we invest significant resources to recruit  train and retain qualified personnel  we may not be successful in our efforts 
we may seek additional financing in the future  which could be difficult to obtain and which could dilute your ownership interest or the value of your shares 
we intend to continue to invest in the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
we believe that our current cash and investment balances  together with cash generated from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  from time to time  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  or other arrangements 
obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance  and investor sentiment 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of additional financing unattractive for us 
if we are unable to raise capital to fund our operations  we may not be able to successfully grow our business 
if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  your percentage ownership will be reduced 
in addition  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding stock 
we also may issue securities that have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may seriously harm our business 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our company  our employees  our facilities and our customers  which could significantly impact our revenues  costs and expenses  and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the long term effects on our company of the september  attacks are unknown 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
our performance will depend on the continued growth in demand for wholesale energy trading  transaction processing  and risk management products and services 
our future success will depend on the continued growth in demand for wholesale energy trading  transaction processing  and risk management products and services  which is difficult to predict 
if demand for these products and services does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected  demand for our software and services will be reduced 
utilities  energy service providers and other businesses  such as commercial or industrial customers  may be slow to adapt to changes in the energy marketplace or may be satisfied with existing services and solutions 
this could result in less demand for our software and services than we currently expect 
because a substantial portion of our operating expenses is fixed in the short term  any unanticipated reduction in demand for our software and services would negatively impact our operating results 
even if there is significant market acceptance of wholesale energy trading  transaction processing  and risk management products and services  we may incur substantial expenses adapting our software and services to changing needs 
the global energy industry is subject to extensive and varied governmental regulations  and  as a result  our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully develop software and services that address numerous and changing regulatory regimes 
although the global energy industry is becoming increasingly deregulated  it is still subject to extensive and varied local  regional and national regulation 
these regulations affect all energy industry participants  including utilities  producers  energy marketers  processors  storage operators  distributors  marketers and pipelines 
if we are unable to design and develop software solutions and strategic consulting services that address the numerous and changing regulatory requirements or we fail to alter our software and services rapidly enough  our customers or potential customers may not purchase our software and services 
in addition  it is difficult to predict the extent to which the global energy industry will continue to become deregulated 
the recent bankruptcy filing of enron corporation  formerly one of the energy industry s largest traders and market makers  has resulted in numerous government and private inquiries and investigations into enron s business and the energy industry in general 
the impact of such inquiries and investigations cannot be determined at this time 
any changes to the laws and regulations to which companies in the energy industry are subject may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our financial success is closely linked to the health of the energy industry 
we currently derive substantially all of our revenues from licensing our software and providing strategic consulting services to participants in the energy industry 
our customers include a number of organizations in the energy industry  and the success of these customers is linked to the health of the energy industry 
accordingly  the success of our business  in turn  depends on the continued health of the energy industry 
moreover  because of the capital expenditures required in connection with investing in our software and services  we believe that demand for our software and services could be affected by fluctuations  disruptions  instability or downturns in the energy market  which may cause current and potential customers to leave the energy industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for our software solutions and strategic consulting services 
enron corporation s recent bankruptcy filing could adversely affect the health of the energy industry 
we currently cannot determine the full impact on the energy industry of enron corporation s recent bankruptcy filing 
prior to its bankruptcy  enron was a dominant participant in the energy industry  and therefore its financial difficulties may have a significant impact on the energy industry  including serving as a possible catalyst for changes to the regulatory regimes governing the energy industry  and resulting in losses to companies in the energy industry due to their credit exposure to enron 
we cannot assure you that any such effects will not harm our business 
for instance  some of our current and potential customers may have credit exposure to enron through various contractual arrangements  such as energy commodity and derivative trading contracts 
to the extent that any of our current or potential customers are adversely affected as a result of their credit exposure to enron  they may reduce their current and future capital expenditures  which could reduce our revenues 
our stock price has been and may remain volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been in the past  and may in the future be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as variations in quarterly operating results  announcements  by us or our competitors  of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts  loss or addition of major customers  conditions and trends in the energy industry  and general conditions in the economy or the financial markets 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which are often unrelated to the performance or condition of particular companies 
such broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company 
if we become subject to this kind of litigation in the future  it could result in substantial litigation costs  damages awards against us  and the diversion of our management s attention and resources 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may prevent or delay acquisition of us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include those that provide for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be presented at stockholder meetings 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
because a small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our common stock  they significantly influence major corporate decisions and our other stockholders may not be able to influence these corporate decisions 
our executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
if these parties act together  they can significantly influence the election of all directors and the approval of actions requiring the approval of a majority of our stockholders 
the interests of our executive officers and directors and their affiliates could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no derivative financial instruments 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  debt instruments of state and municipal governments and their agencies and high quality corporate issuers  money market instruments and bank certificates of deposit 
as of december   we invested the net proceeds from our initial public offering in similar investment grade and highly liquid investments 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of our subsidiaries functional currency as compared to the currencies of foreign denominated sales and purchases 
the results of operations of our subsidiaries  as reported in us dollars  may be significantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the local currencies in which we transact business 
such amount is recorded upon the translation of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars  and is dependent upon the various foreign exchange rates and the magnitude of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements 
at december   our foreign currency translation adjustment was not material and  for the year ended december   net foreign currency transaction losses were insignificant 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and related expenses  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues and of our operating expenses were denominated in british pounds 
historically  the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates has not had a material impact on our operations 
our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will increase as we expand our international operations 
we conduct our european operations in the united kingdom and the countries of the european union which are part of the european monetary union 
there is a single currency within certain countries of the european union  known as the euro  and one organization  the european central bank is responsible for setting european monetary policy 
we have reviewed the impact the euro has on our business and whether this will give rise to a need for significant changes in our commercial operations or treasury management functions 
because our european transactions are primarily denominated in british pounds and as yet we have not experienced any significant impact on our european operations from the fluctuations in the exchange rate between euro and british pounds  we do not believe that the euro conversion will have any material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
