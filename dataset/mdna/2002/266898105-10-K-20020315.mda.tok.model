item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in risk factors 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on research and development of our drug  levulan r  combined with exposure to light  to treat and detect various medical conditions 
in september  we launched our first commercial products  levulan r kerastick r topical solution and the blu u r brand light device  in the united states in cooperation with berlex laboratories  inc berlex  the united states affiliate of schering ag  a german corporation 
as of december  approximately blu u r brand light units were in place  an increase of approximately units as compared to the end of we primarily rent or lease the blu u r to physicians  medical institutions and academic centers throughout the country 
we have primarily devoted our resources to funding research and development in order to advance the levulan r pdt pd technology platform  and as a result  we have experienced significant operating losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  achieving our goal of becoming a profitable operating company is dependent upon the market penetration of our products in the united states by berlex and schering ag in the rest of world except canada  acceptance of our therapy by the medical and consumer constituencies  our ability to meet the supply needs of our customer base  and our ability to develop new products 
while schering ag has significant expertise in dermatology markets outside the united states  and berlex has significant expertise in non dermatology markets in the united states  our products represent berlex s first dermatology marketing effort in the united states 
at the current time  berlex has sales representatives and area managers who are assigned to the levulan r pdt system 
we have been encouraged by the positive response from many physicians and patients who have used our therapy 
however  we recognize that market acceptance has taken longer than we originally anticipated  and has not yet reached the levels that were originally anticipated 
we believe that the entrenched nature of other ak therapies  and uncertainties related to the availability and level of third party reimbursement  has caused potential users of our therapy to delay or decline the use of our therapy 
in addition  we also recognize that berlex has to demonstrate to physicians the clinical value of our new and unique therapy  and the benefits compared to other well established conventional therapies  in order for the medical community to accept our products on a large scale 
as of january   the national reimbursement code for the blu u r application procedure  along with a j code that reimburses physicians for the costs of the levulan r kerastick r became effective 
doctors can also bill for any applicable visit fees 
the codes will facilitate electronic billing for our therapy  eliminating paperwork involved with the previous billing method 
we are hopeful that these changes  along with berlex s ongoing education and marketing programs  will help make levulan r pdt a therapy of choice for aks 
we have incurred scale up and certain fixed costs resulting in under absorbed overhead  which are included in cost of product sales 
management plans to maintain a program to continuously monitor the cost of product sales with the goal of reducing our cost of product sales over time 
it is with this focus that management has decided to construct our own kerastick r manufacturing operation in our leased wilmington  massachusetts facility 
we expect that the development of our own facility will enable us to better manage and control the costs of production  however  our unit cost per kerastick r will increase  until product sales increase significantly 
pre construction activities associated with architectural and engineering plans for our manufacturing facility commenced in the fourth quarter of and construction of the facility started in january the initial build out is expected to take approximately six months  followed by the facility and drug stability testing as required for fda approval  which is expected to occur within approximately six months from the completion of the initial build out 
fda inspection is expected to occur within six months following the construction and testing stages 
this new facility will serve to supplant our kerastick r manufacturer 
in february  we agreed to compensate north safety products  inc north  the manufacturer of our kerastick r brand applicator  for certain overhead expenses associated with the manufacture of the kerastick r to cover underutilization of north s facilities in accordance with an amendment to the purchase and supply agreement  since our recent orders have been below certain previously anticipated levels 
in july  we revised this agreement and paid north  in up front underutilization fees and agreed to make additional payments totaling  covering the period from the execution of this amendment to the agreement through december  through december   we had paid north  of the underutilization fees 
dusa has reported the total commitment of  in deferred charges  which is recognized in cost of product sales on a straight line basis over the term of the amendment 
in consideration for the underutilization fees  north has agreed to maintain its kerastick r manufacturing capabilities in a state of readiness through december   with the capability of producing at least  kerastick r units per month in accordance with established procedures 
the term of the agreement ends on december  unless dusa exercises an option to extend the term through june  if dusa should decide to extend the term  north will be entitled to payment of additional underutilization fees of up to  prorated based on the level of kerastick r units produced from july  through june  in addition  north is obligated to provide us with manufacturing records  personnel support  and a list of consultants and suppliers that have supported the development and manufacturing of the kerastick r 
on september   we amended our marketing  development and supply agreement with schering ag  dated november with the execution of this amendment  schering ag and berlex reimbursed dusa in the amount of  for costs incurred by dusa to modify our manufacturing agreement with north 
this amount has been reported in deferred liabilities and is being recognized as an offset to cost of product sales on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement with north 
in consideration for this amendment  dusa agreed to be liable to schering ag for all consequential damages  including  but not limited to  lost profits  attributed to dusa s failure to supply schering ag s requirements of finished product as defined in the original agreement 
in addition  dusa agreed to qualify itself as the primary manufacturer and supplier of the kerastick r within six months following the date that north ceases production 
dusa and schering ag also agreed to terminate the guaranty by schering ag to dusa of blu u r lease payments by physicians  and the secured line of credit promissory note from schering ag to dusa for up to  to finance inventory of blu u r units 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses as we continue to invest in our research and development programs until product sales increase significantly 
dusa s research and development efforts are continuing to expand in both in dermatology in partnership with schering ag  and in our internal indication development program for barrett s esophagus dysplasia 
during  we increased our staff to full time employees by year end as compared to at the end of the previous year  in order to properly support all activities including production  maintenance  customer support  and financial operations for our products  as well as the research and development programs for dermatology and internal indications 
we expect to slightly increase our staff in to support the development of our drug manufacturing facility 
while our financial position is strong  dusa cannot predict when royalties and supply fees that we are entitled to under our schering ag agreement  along with interest and or other income may offset the cost of these efforts 
for non dermatology indications  we may enter into joint development or licensing arrangements  both domestically and internationally  with pharmaceutical companies 
to the extent that we do not enter into such arrangements  we may require separate funding to complete the regulatory approval process for non dermatology products and would likely need additional funds to market these potential products 
see risk factors our lack of sales and marketing experience could affect our ability to market our non dermatology products  which could adversely affect our revenues from future product sales 
our financial position and results of operations are affected by subjective and complex judgments  particularly in the areas of revenue recognition  deferred revenue and the carrying value of deferred charges and prepaid royalties 
changes to the useful lives being used to amortize deferred revenue and charges could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
as more fully described below and in the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements  we derive revenue from several sources including kerastick r sales  rental income from blu u r brand light sources  research co development programs and previously received milestone payments 
kerastick r sales are recognized upon shipment 
revenues from blu u r leasing programs are generally deferred for six months until demonstration periods are complete or rights of return expire 
co development revenue is earned as we perform the research 
deferred revenue relating to previously received milestone payments amounted to  at december  and is being amortized into income over the year life of our marketing  development and supply agreement with schering ag 
at december   we had recorded an intangible asset amounting to approximately  representing payments to suppliers for manufacturing underutilization charges and facilities reimbursement costs  both of which provide us with future benefits over the lives of the underlying agreements 
of this amount   will be charged to operations in and the remainder in and we are also amortizing a prepaid royalty over an estimated life of years  which matches the full term of the agreement with schering ag mentioned above 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues revenues recognized by dusa in were  as compared to  in of these amounts  we earned research and development revenue of  during as compared to  in from schering ag to support our dermatology co development program 
also included in revenues is amortization of up front milestone and unrestricted grant payments from schering ag of  in compared to  in  reflecting a full year of amortization in these increases were offset by lower product sales of  in as compared to  in  as berlex met its distributor s initial kerastick r supply needs in the fourth quarter of subsequent to dusa s september product launch 
no revenue was recognized in  as dusa had not yet launched its first products 
product sales during and primarily reflected sales of the kerastick r 
royalty revenues are earned and recognized by dusa when the kerastick r is sold by berlex to its distributor  and are payable to dusa during the quarter following the quarter in which the sales are made 
dusa recognizes supply fee revenue related to these sales when dusa s supplier ships the kerastick r to berlex 
product sales during also included rental income on blu u r units of approximately  there was no rental income recognized in initially  dusa generally leased its blu u r brand light units for use with the levulan r kerastick r 
in july  dusa and berlex test marketed a new program  which was then launched nationally in mid september under this program  dusa rents the blu u r to physicians for months with no rental payments incurred by physicians and no rental revenue recognized by dusa for the first six months  while berlex provides physicians with a supply of kerastick r samples 
physicians have the right to terminate the rental at any time during the month period 
we are negotiating with a medical device leasing company to manage the rental program including coordinating payment plans with the physicians 
berlex is actively working to convert physicians to this new marketing program 
as of december   blu u r units are in physicians offices under the new program 
under this new marketing program  revenues will be recognized over the last months of the rental period 
under our previous marketing program  we sold the blu u r to a medical device leasing company 
we then engaged the leasing company to complete the leasing and or rental transactions  including coordinating payment plans with the physicians 
the leasing company had been paying us for the units within days after installation in the physicians offices 
dusa  berlex and the leasing company will continue to support customers that remain on this initial program  however  the majority of such customers have converted to the new program 
under the initial program  physicians have the right to cancel their leases after periods of up to one year 
therefore  payments received by dusa upon sale of the blu u r to the leasing company are reported as deferred revenues until the physician s right to cancel the lease has expired 
under the initial program  contracts with physicians have been canceled 
of the blu u r brand light units under these contracts have been returned as of december  in the event that a customer does cancel a lease  we have agreed to repurchase the units from the leasing company at an agreed upon price 
as of december   customers from the initial program have converted to the new program 
these units have been repurchased from the leasing company and the corresponding deferred revenue has been reversed from the financial statements 
units leased or rented by physicians remain under the initial program  and units are in the field based on direct sales and demonstration units 
under our agreement with schering ag  two thirds of the agreed upon dermatology research and development expenses  up to  per year for and  were reimbursable to dusa by schering ag 
total research and development reimbursement earned by dusa in was  for  schering ag has agreed to fund the co development program up to  subject to the results of dermatology feasibility studies currently ongoing and further decisions by the development committee  which meets quarterly 
based on the agreed upon development plan and the timing of the start of the clinical trials  we were only entitled to reimbursement of  for the year ended december  future spending levels are subject to mutual agreement of schering ag and dusa 
the total amount of up front milestone and unrestricted grant payments received in and have been recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and are recognized as income on a straight line basis over the term of dusa s alliance agreement with schering ag 
for the years ended december  and  approximately  and  respectively  of up front milestone and unrestricted grant payments were reflected in revenues in the consolidated statement of operations 
cost of product sales and royalties cost of product sales and royalties for were  including  in direct kerastick r related product costs   in shipping and installing the blu u r in physicians offices  and  in amortization of deferred charges reflecting consideration paid by us in to amend our supply agreement with sochinaz sa  the manufacturer of the bulk drug ingredient used in levulan r 
also included in cost of product sales is  in net underutilization costs paid to our drug manufacturer  north safety products  inc  due to orders to north falling below certain previously anticipated levels 
in  cost of product sales and royalties also included royalties and supply fees of approximately  reflecting minimum royalty payments due to dusa s licensor  parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario 
in  we began to allocate personnel costs to product sale operations and or general and administrative functions  as a significant percentage of manufacturing development activities have been completed for our current products 
such personnel related costs allocated to cost of product sales were approximately  in cost of product sales and royalties for were  including kerastick r sales to berlex in the amount of  royalties and supply fees of  amortization of deferred charges of  and approximately  in costs associated with shipping and installing the blu u r in physician s offices 
there were no product sales and therefore no cost of product sales during inventory costs related to the blu u r commercial light sources under rental or lease are deferred and recorded in other current assets until the blu u r is no longer returnable to dusa by the physician  which is one year under the initial marketing program 
under the new marketing program  costs of blu u r inventory will be recognized over the month term of the rental 
as of december  and  deferred inventory costs were approximately  and  the higher cost of product sales as compared to revenues from product sales is primarily a result of the lower than anticipated level of kerastick r sales  coupled with overhead attributed to the payment of underutilization costs to our kerastick r supplier  as noted above  and the allocation of personnel to product sales operations 
management expects that such costs will initially increase in our own facility but would be covered by product revenue assuming the level of kerastick r sales significantly increases  which is dependent upon the market penetration of our products 
in early  in order to meet the production scheduling needs of our third party manufacturer of the blu u r  national biological corporation nbc  we prepaid raw material costs in the amount of  associated with our orders 
this amount is being credited against the final purchase price of finished units  which is due on delivery at the rate of  per completed unit 
at the end of december  approximately  of this prepayment remained outstanding and was recorded in other current assets 
in addition  since we did not order a certain number of blu u r brand units on january  for delivery in  we paid  to nbc for certain of its overhead costs 
in consideration for this payment  nbc has agreed to maintain its blu u r manufacturing capabilities in a state of readiness during with the capability of producing blu u r units in accordance with established procedures 
we will recognize this payment in cost of product sales on a straight line basis during research and development costs dusa s research and development costs for the years ended   and were approximately   and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to is attributable to higher third party expenditures for dermatology and internal indications coupled with increased personnel costs related to on going development activities 
during  this increase was partially offset by the reassignment of personnel costs to product sale operations and or general and administrative functions  rather than to research and development costs  as a significant percentage of the development activities were completed for our currently marketed dermatology products in the increase in as compared to is mainly attributed to manufacturing development expenses  reflecting increased personnel costs and pre production activities for our products prior to market launch 
as stated above under management s discussion and analysis revenues  under our agreement with schering ag  two thirds  or  of the agreed upon dermatology research and development expenses were reimbursable to dusa by schering ag for as compared to  for in july  the united states food and drug administration fda completed its review of three investigational new drug applications allowing initiation of clinical trials using levulan r pdt for the treatment of onychomycosis nail fungus  warts  and barrett s esophagus dysplasia 
on october   we initiated a second phase i ii clinical trial for the treatment of barrett s esophagus dysplasia 
subject to success in these phase i ii feasibility studies  dusa plans to move forward with more expensive pre pivotal phase ii studies for some or all of these indications  related party transactions starting in late dusa expects that research and development costs will increase to approximately  due to increased expenditures for dermatology and internal indications and phase iv studies mandated by the fda in connection with our first product approval 
costs and development fees associated with agreements for research projects and clinical studies commit us to make payments of  and  for  and  respectively 
if schering ag decides to eliminate all  or a portion of the reimbursement budget for the dermatology co development program our research and development costs could increase significantly unless we delayed or curtailed some or all of these programs 
see management s discussion and analysis contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 
general and administrative cost general and administrative expenses for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
the increases in and were mainly attributable to the hiring of additional staff commencing in second half of through the first half of  including key management personnel in administrative  financial  information technology  and operations functions 
general and administrative costs are expected to remain stable for compared to as staffing levels for these functions have been established 
interest income interest income was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively  and is primarily earned on united states government securities 
the increase for reflects earnings on higher investable cash balances as a result of the  received from schering ag during the fourth quarter of  and the full year impact of approximately  in net proceeds received from a private placement in march similarly  the increase for was also due to  received from schering ag during the fourth quarter of interest income will decline as our investable cash balances are reduced to support dusa s operating activities 
income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through see note to the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements 
a provision for alternative minimum tax was recorded in for  net losses dusa incurred net losses of approximately  or per share   or per share  and  or per share  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these losses were within management s expectations  and are expected to continue unless market penetration of our first products increases significantly 
dusa expects an estimated loss in between  and  this does not include any additional new spending that may be required during the year  such as costs related to the potential acquisition or development of new products or companies  any decision  in cooperation with schering ag  to increase levulan r pdt dermatology spending levels  any additional levulan r pdt internal clinical trial costs that become justified later in the year  and any extraordinary miscellaneous costs and expenses 
related party transactions dusa s vice president of business development and vice president of technology are principal shareholders of lumenetics  inc  our former light device consultants 
during and  dusa paid  and  respectively  for certain equipment leased under operating leases from lumenetics 
in  dusa purchased this equipment for  in addition  we reimbursed lumenetics for office space and related expenses totaling approximately  in all transactions were executed at prices estimated to be fair market values 
quarterly results of operations the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively quarterly results for year ended december  march june september december total revenues     loss from operations     net loss     basic and diluted loss per share quarterly results for year ended december  march june september december total revenues     loss from operations     net loss     basic and diluted loss per share liquidity and capital resources we are in a strong cash position to continue and expand our research and development activities for our levulan r pdt pd platform 
our total assets were  as of december  compared to  as of december  this decrease is mainly attributable to the funding of net operating activities during with limited product sales 
as of december   we had inventory of  representing finished goods and raw materials  as compared to  as of december  also  as of december   we had net property and equipment of  as compared to  as of december   due primarily to the installation of new financial and operations systems  and pre construction costs associated with architectural and engineering plans for our manufacturing facility 
dusa expects to incur costs of approximately  during for the construction of this facility 
as of december   we had accounts receivable of  as compared to  as of december   representing net sales associated with product sales 
in addition  a receivable of  has been recorded as a current asset as of december  as compared to  at the end of the same period in the previous year for amounts which are reimbursable by schering ag for research and development costs under our agreement 
as of december   we had current liabilities of  as compared to  as of december  since our inception  we have had no long term debt  however  dusa is in the process of evaluating financing options for the construction of its manufacturing facility in its wilmington headquarters 
we have been approved for a loan of  to finance such development 
we invest our cash in united states government securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
these securities have an aggregate cost of  and a current aggregate market value of  as of december   resulting in a net unrealized gain on securities available for sale of  which has been included in shareholders equity 
as of december   government securities had an aggregate cost of  and an aggregate market value of  resulting in a net unrealized gain of  due to fluctuations in interest rates and depending upon the timing of our need to convert government securities into cash to meet our working capital requirements  some gains or losses could be realized 
as of december   these securities had interest rates and yields ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from january  to november  we expect to use approximately  in cash to fund net operating activities during we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to proceed with our current development program for levulan r pdt pd  and to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we have invested our funds in liquid investments  so that we will have ready access to these cash reserves  as needed  for the funding of development plans on a short term and long term basis 
dusa is actively seeking to expand or enhance its business by using its resources to acquire by license  purchase or other arrangements  businesses  technologies  or products 
we also plan to continue to actively seek relationships with pharmaceutical or other suitable organizations to help develop and or market some of our potential non dermatology products and technologies 
as of december   dusa had deferred revenues of  as compared to  at december   reflecting net milestone and unrestricted grant payments of  and the deferral of  in product sales related to our customer s one year right of return on leases of our commercial light sources 
commencing with our product launch in september  we began to amortize the schering ag milestone and unrestricted grant payments into revenue 
the amortization period is expected to be years  the term of the schering ag agreement  based upon current revenue recognition principles 
see note to the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we are currently focusing our efforts on providing support to berlex in its effort to penetrate the marketplace with our unique levulan r pdt therapy for aks  on conducting the expanded dermatology co development program with schering ag  and on furthering development of our internal research and development program 
full development and testing of all potential indications that are currently under development or being considered for development may require additional funding 
the timing of expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including o progress of our research and development programs  o continuing support from schering ag  o the results of preclinical and clinical trials  o the timing of regulatory marketing approvals  o competitive developments  o the level of sales of our first products  o any new additional collaborative arrangements  if any  we may enter  and o the availability of other financing 
we cannot accurately predict the magnitude of revenues from sales of our products 
while the net proceeds of the january and march offerings coupled with payments received from schering ag will enable us to maintain our current research program as planned and support the commercialization of levulan r pdt for aks for the foreseeable future  in order to maintain and expand continuing research and development programs  dusa may need to raise additional funds through future corporate alliances  financings  or other sources  depending upon the amount of revenues we receive from our first product 
additionally  schering ag has the right to terminate our agreement on months written notice 
if schering ag were to decide to terminate our agreement early  we could incur significant additional research and development expenses  and we may have to establish a marketing capability  also at significant expense 
in addition  the balance of the deferred revenue mentioned above  and deferred royalty would be recognized in the year of termination 
as of december   we had full time employees 
we have employment agreements with our key executive officers 
we have purchased and are the named beneficiary of a key man life insurance contract having a face value of cdn  on the life of our president 
we expect only moderate increases in our staff in to support the development of our drug manufacturing facility as staffing levels related to key management personnel in administrative  financial  technical and operations functions have been established for the commercialization of levulan r pdt 
we have not made any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 
however  as we are in the process of developing a production line for kerastick r manufacturing  we expect that environmental laws will govern our facility 
we have estimated that the capital costs to develop this facility  including equipment  will be approximately  there can be no assurance  however  that we will not be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future  or any assurance that our operations  business or assets will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations 
see business government regulation 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments dusa s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as lease agreements  research and development contracts  manufacturing contracts  or other related agreements are as follows at december  contractual obligations due by period commitments total year or less years years after years operating lease obligations      research and development projects    manufacturing facility development   other short term obligations    in  dusa extended its lease commitment for its office and manufacturing space in its wilmington  massachusetts headquarters through november we have the ability to terminate the wilmington lease after the th year of the lease by providing the landlord with notice at least seven and one half months prior to the date on which the termination would be effective 
the operating lease obligations disclosed above include payments for the non cancelable term of the lease 
in addition  as our valhalla and toronto lease commitments expire during  the company is evaluating its alternatives for new office facilities 
in addition to the obligations disclosed above  we have contracted with therapeutics  inc  a clinical research organization  to manage the clinical development of our products in the field of dermatology 
this organization has the opportunity for additional stock grants  bonuses  and other incentives for each product indication ranging from  to  depending on the regulatory phase of development of products during its management 
dusa has commenced the development of a kerastick r manufacturing facility at our wilmington  massachusetts location 
construction started in january the initial build out is expected to be completed by june  followed by facility and drug stability testing  which is expected to take approximately six months 
fda inspection  which is expected to occur within approximately six months following the construction and testing stages 
the company has estimated that the costs to construct this facility  including equipment  are approximately  and is evaluating financing options 
this cost includes estimates to build the facility and all costs of calibration  validation testing and equipment  and any related fda approval costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we hold fixed income united states government securities that are subject to interest rate market risks 
however  we do not believe that the risk is material as we make our investments in relatively short term instruments and we strive to match the maturity dates of these instruments to our cash flow needs
