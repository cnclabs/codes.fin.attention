the partnership operates and reports in three business segments downstream segment interstate transportation  storage and terminaling of petroleum products and lpgs  intrastate transportation of petrochemicals and the fractionation of ngls conducted primarily through te products and its subsidiary  upstream segment transportation  aggregation and marketing of crude oil and ngls and the distribution of lube oils and specialty chemicals conducted primarily through tctm and its subsidiaries  and midstream segment gathering of natural gas in the green river basin in southwestern wyoming conducted primarily through teppco midstream and its interest in jonah 
the partnership s reportable segments offer different products and services and are managed separately because each requires different business strategies 
each of the subsidiaries of the partnership that are limited partnerships is managed by teppco gp  a wholly owned subsidiary of the partnership that acts as managing general partner with a general partner interest 
the downstream segment revenues are derived from the transportation of refined products and lpgs  the storage and short haul shuttle transportation of lpgs at the mont belvieu complex  intrastate transportation of petrochemicals  fractionation of ngls  sale of product inventory and other ancillary services 
labor and electric power costs comprise the two largest operating expense items of the downstream segment 
operations are somewhat seasonal with higher revenues generally realized during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
refined products volumes are generally higher during the second and third quarters because of greater demand for gasolines during the spring and summer driving seasons 
lpgs volumes are generally higher from november through march due to higher demand in the northeast for propane  a major fuel for residential heating 
the upstream segment revenues are earned from the gathering  storage  transportation and marketing of crude oil and ngls and the distribution of lube oils and specialty chemicals  principally in oklahoma  texas and the rocky mountain region 
marketing operations consist primarily of aggregating purchased crude oil along its pipeline systems  or from third party pipeline systems  and arranging the necessary logistics for the ultimate sale of the crude oil to local refineries  marketers or other end users 
on july   the partnership completed an acquisition of assets from arco for million  which included million of acquisition related costs other than the purchase price 
an additional million was paid in october  for final post closing adjustments 
the purchased assets included arco s percent voting interest in seaway 
the partnership assumed arco s role as operator of this pipeline 
the company also acquired arco s crude oil terminal facilities in cushing and midland  including the line transfer and pumpover business at 
table of contents each location  an undivided ownership interest in both the rancho pipeline and the basin pipeline  both of which are operated by another joint owner  and the receipt and delivery pipelines known as the west texas trunk system  located around the midland terminal 
the transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations of the assets acquired have been included in the upstream segment since the purchase on july  the midstream segment commenced operations on september   when the partnership acquired jonah from alberta energy company for million 
an additional million was accrued december   for final purchase adjustments related primarily to construction projects in progress at the time of closing 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of the acquisition are included in the partnership s consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of the jonah assets are managed and operated by defs under a contract arrangement 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
changes in these estimates could materially affect the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental costs the partnership accrues for environmental costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations 
environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies of potentially contaminated sites  costs for remediation and restoration of sites determined to be contaminated and ongoing monitoring costs  as well as fines  damages and other costs  when estimable 
the balance of accrued undiscounted environmental liabilities are monitored on a regular basis by management 
liabilities for environmental costs at a specific site are initially recorded when the partnership s liability for such costs  including direct internal and legal costs  is probable and a reasonable estimate of the associated costs can be made 
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded  from time to time  to reflect changing circumstances and estimates based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
estimates of the partnership s ultimate liabilities associated with environmental costs are particularly difficult to make with certainty due to the number of variables involved  including the early stage of investigation at certain sites  the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation alternatives available and the evolving nature of environmental laws and regulations 
for information concerning environmental regulation and environmental costs and contingencies  see item and business and properties environmental matters in this report 
property  plant and equipment statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of requires that an entity review long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  whenever events occur that indicate that the book value of an asset may not be recoverable in the future 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas  but retains its fundamental provisions for reorganizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
during the second quarter of  pennzoil quaker state company pennzoil sold its shreveport  louisiana  refinery and canceled refined products production 
pennzoil and te products negotiated a settlement of million to terminate a long term transportation agreement from the shreveport origin point on the products pipeline system 
under the transportation agreement  pennzoil had a throughput commitment of  barrels per day 
the partnership is pursuing various alternatives related to the reduced receipt volumes including making system changes to allow for bi directional product flow to make 
table of contents deliveries into the shreveport market area 
the partnership has evaluated the impact of the contract termination on the pipeline segment from shreveport to el dorado  arkansas  in accordance with sfas the evaluation did not result in an impairment of the carrying value of the related transportation assets 
the termination payment was recorded as refined products transportation revenue in however  if alternative revenue sources are not realized on this pipeline segment  an impairment may be recorded  which could have a material adverse effect on the partnership s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
intangible assets on september   the partnership completed the purchase of all of the partnership interests of jonah from alberta energy company for million 
an additional million was accrued at december   for final purchase adjustments related primarily to construction projects in progress at the time of closing 
in connection with this acquisition  the partnership assumed contracts that dedicate future production from natural gas wells in the green river basin in the state of wyoming 
the partnership assigned million of the purchase price to these production contracts based upon a fair value appraisal at the time of closing 
the value assigned to intangible assets are amortized over the expected lives of the contracts approximately years in proportion to the timing of the expected contractual volumes 
on an annual basis  the partnership will update production estimates of the natural gas wells and reassess the remaining useful life of the contract assets 
changes in the estimated remaining production could negatively impact the timing of amortization expense reported for future periods 
results of operations summarized below is financial data by business segment in thousands years ended december  operating revenues downstream segment midstream segment upstream segment intercompany eliminations total operating revenues operating income downstream segment midstream segment upstream segment total operating income net income downstream segment midstream segment upstream segment total net income the results for the year ended  reflect the addition of the midstream segment for the fourth quarter of  as a result of the acquisition of jonah on september  the results for the year ended  reflect the increased operations in the upstream segment resulting from the acquisition of the arco assets in july  which results were impacted in as a result of having a full year of operations attributed to the former arco assets 
following is a detailed analysis of the results of operations  discussing the reasons for changes in results  by each operating segment of the partnership 

table of contents downstream segment volume and average tariff information for  and is presented below percentage years ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except tariff information volumes delivered refined products lpgs mont belvieu operations total average tariff per barrel refined products lpgs mont belvieu operations average system tariff per barrel excludes million received from pennzoil for canceled transportation agreement discussed below 
compared to for the year ended  the downstream segment reported net income of million  compared with net income of million for the year ended the million increase in net income was primarily due to a million increase in operating revenues and a million decrease in interest expense  partially offset by a million increase in costs and expenses  million in losses from equity investments  a million decrease in capitalized interest and a million decrease in other income net 
factors influencing these variances are described below 
refined products transportation revenues increased million for the year ended  compared with  primarily due to million of revenue recognized on the canceled transportation agreement with pennzoil and the recognition of million of previously deferred revenue related to the approval of market based rates during the second quarter of see further discussion regarding these factors included in other considerations 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in refined products volumes delivered 
deliveries of mtbe decreased million barrels as a result of the expiration of contract deliveries to the partnership s marine terminal near beaumont  texas  in april as a result of the contract expiration  the partnership no longer transports mtbe through its products pipeline system 
jet fuel volumes decreased million barrels  or  due to reduced air travel demand in the midwest market areas 
the total refined products volume decrease was partially offset by increased distillate demand in the south central market areas and increased distillate deliveries at a third party terminal in houston  texas 
the refined products average rate per barrel increased from the prior year period primarily due to an increased percentage of long haul volumes delivered in lpgs transportation revenues increased million for the year ended  compared with  primarily due to increased propane deliveries in the midwest that resulted from favorable price differentials of gulf coast propane compared with competing midwest supply sources 
additionally  increased feedstock demand resulted in higher deliveries of isobutane in the chicago market area 
short haul deliveries of propane along the upper texas gulf coast decreased from the prior year due to lower petrochemical feedstock demand and operational problems at a petrochemical facility served by the partnership 
the lpgs average rate per barrel 
table of contents increased from the prior year as a result of an increased percentage of long haul deliveries to the upper midwest market areas 
revenues generated from mont belvieu operations increased million during the year ended  compared with  as a result of increased loading fees  brine service revenue and butane segregation charges  partially offset by lower contract storage revenue 
mont belvieu shuttle deliveries decreased during the year ended  compared with  due to reduced propane and butane demand for petrochemical feedstock along the upper texas gulf coast 
the mont belvieu average rate per barrel increased in as a result of increased non contract deliveries  which generally carry higher rates 
other operating revenues increased million during the year ended  compared with  primarily due to an million increase in contract petrochemical delivery revenue  which started during the fourth quarter of  increased refined products loading fees  increased propane deliveries at the providence  rhode island  import facility and increased gains on product sales 
these increases were partially offset by losses incurred as a result of exchanging products at different geographic points of delivery to position product in the midwest market area 
costs and expenses increased million for the year ended  compared with  comprised of a million increase in operating  general and administrative expenses  a million increase in operating fuel and power expense and a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by a million decrease in taxes other than income taxes 
the increase in operating  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased employee benefit costs  increased supplies and services and environmental remediation expenses  partially offset by the march write off of project evaluation costs related to the proposed pipeline construction from beaumont  texas  to little rock  arkansas  and decreased product measurement losses 
operating fuel and power expense increased as a result of higher rates charged by electric utilities and increased long haul volumes delivered 
the increase in depreciation expense from the prior year period resulted from assets placed in service during the fourth quarter of the decrease in taxes other than income taxes resulted from actual property taxes being lower than previously estimated 
interest expense attributable to the downstream segment decreased million during the year ended  compared with  as a result of lower interest rates on borrowings under the variable rate credit facilities and the favorable impact of the fixed to floating interest rate swap on the te products senior notes  effective october  interest capitalized decreased million during the year ended  compared with  as a result of the completion of the petrochemical pipelines from mont belvieu to port arthur  texas  during the fourth quarter of net loss from equity investments totaled million during the year ended due primarily to pre operating expenses of centennial 
other income net decreased million during the year ended  compared with  due primarily to lower interest income earned on cash investments 
the downstream segment is dependent in large part on the demand for refined petroleum products in the markets served by its pipelines 
reductions in that demand adversely affect the pipeline business of the downstream segment 
market demand varies based upon the different end uses of the refined products shipped in the downstream segment 
demand for gasoline  which has in recent years accounted for approximately one half of the downstream segment s refined products transportation revenues  depends upon price  prevailing economic conditions and demographic changes in the markets served in the downstream segment 
weather conditions  governmental policy and crop prices affect the demand for refined products used in agricultural operations 
demand for jet fuel  which has in recent years accounted for almost one quarter of the downstream segment s refined products revenues  depends on prevailing economic conditions and military usage 
propane deliveries are generally sensitive to the weather and meaningful year to year variances have occurred and will likely continue to occur 
compared to for the year ended  net income of the downstream segment decreased million compared with primarily due to a million increase in costs and expenses and a million increase in interest expense  
table of contents partially offset by a million increase in operating revenues and a million increase in capitalized interest 
factors influencing these variances are described below 
refined products transportation revenues decreased million for the year ended  compared with  as a result of a decrease in total refined products volumes delivered 
motor fuel volumes delivered decreased by million barrels and distillate volumes delivered decreased by million barrels due primarily to a local refinery expansion in the west memphis market and unfavorable price differentials in the midwest market area 
natural gasoline volumes delivered declined million barrels due primarily to the expiration of a contract in late for deliveries to the chicago area  along with unfavorable processing and blending economics in the chicago market area 
these decreases were primarily offset by a million barrel increase in jet fuel volumes delivered due to continued strong demand in the chicago market area and at the cincinnati airport that is supplied by the partnership 
the partnership deferred recognition of approximately million of revenue during the year ended  with respect to potential refund obligations for rates charged in excess of the ppi index while its application for market based rates was under review by the ferc 
lpgs transportation revenues increased million for the year ended  compared with  due to a increase in volumes delivered and a increase in the average lpgs tariff per barrel 
colder winter weather during the first and fourth quarters of  coupled with lower customer storage levels contributed to a million barrel increase in propane volumes delivered in the northeast market area and a million barrel increase in propane volumes delivered in the midwest market area 
increased refinery demand in the northeast market area resulted in a million barrel increase in butane volumes delivered 
the larger percentage of long haul deliveries during resulted in a increase in the average lpgs tariff per barrel 
revenues generated from mont belvieu operations increased million for the year  compared with  primarily due to increased brine handling fees and higher storage revenue 
other operating revenues increased million during the year ended  compared with  primarily due to million of deficiency revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of related to the beginning of a year contract for petrochemical deliveries at port arthur  and a million increase in gains on the sale of product inventory attributable to higher market prices in the additional increases resulted from increased refined products terminaling revenue and increased custody transfer services at mont belvieu facilities 
costs and expenses of the downstream segment increased million during the year ended  compared with  due to a million increase in operating  general and administrative expenses  a million increase in operating fuel and power expense and a million increase in depreciation and amortization charges

the write off of project evaluation costs resulted from the announcement in march of the partnership s abandonment of its plan to construct a pipeline from beaumont to little rock in favor of participation in the centennial joint venture 
these increases in operating  general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a million decrease in expenses associated with year activities incurred in the increase in operating fuel and power expense from the prior year resulted primarily from higher fuel prices charged by electric utilities in depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of million in depreciation expense related to the completion of the petrochemical pipelines and other capital additions placed in service throughout interest expense attributable to the downstream segment increased million during the year ended  compared with  as a result of borrowings under a term loan to finance construction of the petrochemical pipelines between mont belvieu and port arthur 
additionally  amortization of debt issue costs increased million during the year ended the increase in interest expense was offset by increased interest capitalized of million during the year ended  as a result of higher balances associated with construction of the petrochemical pipelines 

table of contents other income net increased million during the year ended  compared with  as a result of gains on the sale of right of way easements during the second quarter of  coupled with increased interest income earned on cash investments in upstream segment margin of the upstream segment is calculated as revenues generated from the sale of crude oil and lubrication oil  and transportation of crude oil and ngls  less the costs of purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil 
margin is a more meaningful measure of financial performance than operating revenues and operating expenses due to the significant fluctuations in revenues and expenses caused by variations in the level of marketing activity and prices for products marketed
