this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in the section entitled factors affecting future results and elsewhere in the report 
lattice semiconductor corporation designs  develops and markets high performance programmable logic devices  or plds  and related software 
programmable logic devices are widely used semiconductor components that can be configured by the end customer as specific logic circuits  and enable the end customer to shorten design cycle times and reduce development costs 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  industrial  military and consumer end markets 
the and fiscal years are twelve month periods  as compared to our nine month fiscal period results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue represented by selected items reflected in our consolidated statement of operations year ended dec

in addition  we exchanged lattice stock options for all of the outstanding stock options under the former vantis employee stock plans with a calculated black scholes value of million 
the total purchase price for vantis was million 
the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an independent appraisal and management estimates 
in process research development ipr d costs were appraised at million and charged to operations on the acquisition date 
remaining intangible asset costs are being amortized to operations over five years using the straight line method see new accounting pronouncements in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the purchase was financed using a combination of cash reserves and a credit facility bearing interest at adjustable rates 
the credit facility was replaced with convertible subordinated notes in november see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
revenue was million in  a decrease of from fiscal revenue of million represented an increase of from the million recorded in fiscal period revenue from the sale of high density products represented  and of total revenue for  and fiscal period  respectively 
during  the semiconductor and pld markets experienced a significant downturn 
our revenue decrease in as compared to  was a result of this downturn and the resultant decrease in demand for our products 
revenue declined across all geographies while the communications end market was particularly weak 
in addition to our acquisition of vantis  the increase in revenue in was primarily attributable to increased sales of high density products  particularly our new low voltage high density products  in all geographic regions 
additionally  was a twelve month fiscal year  as opposed to our nine month fiscal period our sales by geographic region were as follows year ended december  year ended december  nine months ended december  in thousands united states export sales europe asia other revenue from export sales as a percentage of total revenue was approximately for  for and for fiscal period we expect export sales to continue to represent a significant portion of revenue 
the average selling price of our products was approximately flat in as compared to  but increased in as compared to fiscal period the average selling price for our products decreased significantly in the second half of as a result of the significant downturn in the semiconductor and pld markets 
other fluctuations in average selling price  including the overall increase in  were due primarily to product mix changes and increased sales of high density products 
although selling prices of mature products generally decline over time  this decline is at times offset by higher selling prices of new products 
our ability to maintain or increase the level of our average selling price is dependent on the continued development  introduction and market acceptance of new products 
see factors affecting future results 
gross margin 
our gross margin was for  for and for fiscal period continued reductions in our overall manufacturing costs and improvements in our product mix generally offset an increased proportion of fixed manufacturing costs in product mix in was favorably affected by a higher ratio of previously deferred income compared to income from direct customer sales 
the gross margin improvement in was primarily due to reductions in our manufacturing costs and improvements in our product mix 
reductions in manufacturing costs resulted primarily from on going yield improvements  migration of products to more advanced technologies and smaller die sizes 
research and development 
research and development expense was million for  million in and million in fiscal period the decrease in when compared to was attributable to a decrease in discretionary spending which more than offset headcount increases 
in addition to our acquisition of vantis  spending increases in were due to increased headcount and associated expenses related to development of new products 
additionally  was a twelve month fiscal year  as opposed to our nine month fiscal period we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product leadership in our existing product families and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in  million in and million in fiscal period the decrease in when compared to was primarily due to lower variable costs associated with reduced revenue and profitability  reductions in discretionary spending and  to a lesser extent  the reversal in the third quarter of of million of reserves established in the vantis acquisition related to the now settled altera litigation see note to our consolidated financial statements 
increased expenses in were primarily due to increased variable costs associated with higher revenue levels and our vantis acquisition 
additionally  was a twelve month fiscal period  as opposed to the nine month fiscal period in process research and development 
in process research and development costs of approximately million were incurred on june  in connection with our acquisition of vantis see note to our consolidated financial statements 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets acquired in the vantis acquisition and the acquisition of integrated intellectual property  inc ip on march  was million in  million in and million for fiscal period the increase in amortization for as compared to was primarily due to the ip acquisition 
the increase in amortization for was primarily due to a full year of amortization in as opposed to the approximately months included in fiscal period the estimated weighted average useful life of the intangible assets for current technology  assembled workforce  customer lists  trademarks  patents and residual goodwill  created as a result of the acquisition  is approximately five years 
loss gain on foundry investments 
the gain on foundry investments recorded in the first quarter of and the loss on foundry investments recorded in the third quarter of represent equity market appreciation and subsequent impairment loss on our umc common shares see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income was million in  million in  and million in fiscal period the increase in when compared to was attributable to overall increased cash balances generated from our follow on stock offering  completed in july  which more than offset lower interest rates on invested balances in the interest income increase was due to our follow on stock offering  cash generated from operations and stock option exercises 
additionally  was a twelve month fiscal period as opposed to our nine month fiscal period interest expense 
interest expense was approximately million in both and and million in fiscal period substantially all interest expense resulted from the debt issued to partially fund our vantis acquisition 
the interest expense increase of was due to the fact that acquisition related debt was outstanding for all of  but only for months in fiscal period benefit provision for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes for results in an effective tax rate of  as compared to in and for fiscal period the tax benefit in is the result of the pretax loss reported in the period 
the rate associated with the tax benefit in is higher than the provision rate in because of the proportional impact of our marginal tax rate applied to the unrealized gain in and subsequent impairment loss in related to our foundry investments see note to our consolidated financial statements in comparison to taxes on operating income and non taxable investment income 
the benefit for income taxes for fiscal period was attributable to the tax effect of the in process research and development cost recognized in conjunction with our vantis acquisition 
the effective rate for all periods presented is lower than the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily because of tax exempt investment income and tax credits 
extraordinary item  net of income taxes 
the extraordinary item  net of income taxes  in fiscal period represents the writeoff of unamortized loan fees related to the early retirement of our credit facility in connection with the re financing of our acquisition of vantis 
factors affecting future results a downturn in the communications equipment or computing end markets will cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and profit levels 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the communications equipment and computing end markets 
a downturn in the overall global economy or in the economies of the countries where we derive significant revenue could lead to a contraction of capital spending on information technology 
this in turn could lead to a reduction in the demand for communications or computing equipment and for our products 
due to a deterioration in overall economic conditions and a significant reduction in information technology capital spending  the communications and computing end markets declined in when compared to prior years 
in addition  the abrupt transition from an environment of rapid growth to the current environment in these end equipment markets has resulted in an excess of component inventory within our end customers 
at present and in the future when these or other similar conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain or increase revenue and profit levels during future industry downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  to a greater extent than other less dynamic or less technology driven industries 
our financial performance has periodically been negatively affected by past downturns in the semiconductor industry 
factors that have contributed to these downturns include the cyclical nature of the demand for the products of semiconductor customers  general reductions in inventory levels by customers  excess production capacity  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
in  the semiconductor industry experienced a significant downturn 
at present and in the future when these or other similar conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
we may experience unexpected difficulties integrating the fpga business we recently purchased from agere systems 
on january   we acquired the field programmable gate array fpga business of agere systems and are currently in the process of integrating this business with our operations 
if our integration is unsuccessful  more difficult or more time consuming than originally planned  we may incur unexpected disruptions to our ongoing business 
these disruptions could harm our operating results 
further  the following specific factors may adversely affect our ability to integrate the fpga business of agere we may experience unexpected losses of key employees or customers  we may not be able to coordinate our new product and process development in a way which permits us to bring future new products to the market in a timely manner  we may experience unexpected costs and discover unexpected liabilities  we may not achieve expected levels of revenue growth  cost reduction and profitability improvement  and we may experience difficulties or delays in conforming the standards  processes  procedures and controls of our two businesses 
in addition  as part of our acquisition  we entered into agreements with agere systems to obtain certain manufacturing  intellectual property and transition support and services 
in the event that agere fails to provide this support and service  or provides such support and service at a level of quality and timeliness inconsistent with the historical delivery of such support and service  our ability to integrate the fpga business will be hampered and our operating results may be harmed 
we may be unsuccessful in defining  developing or selling new products required to maintain or expand our business 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic environment marked by rapid product obsolescence 
our future success depends on our ability to introduce new or improved products that meet customer needs while achieving acceptable margins 
if we fail to introduce these new products in a timely manner or these products fail to achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
the introduction of new products in a dynamic market environment presents significant business challenges 
product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales 
the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long term market demand and future technology developments 
our future revenue growth is dependent on market acceptance of our new product families and the continued market acceptance of our software development tools 
the success of these products is dependent on a variety of specific technical factors including successful product definition  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of wafer manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  and the quality and reliability of the product 
if  due to these or other factors  our new products do not achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
our products may not be competitive if we are unsuccessful in migrating our manufacturing processes to more advanced technologies or alternative fabrication facilities 
to develop new products and maintain the competitiveness of existing products  we need to migrate to more advanced wafer manufacturing processes that use larger wafer sizes and smaller device geometries 
we also may need to use additional foundries 
because we depend upon foundries to provide their facilities and support for our process technology development  we may experience delays in the availability of advanced wafer manufacturing process technologies at existing or new wafer fabrication facilities 
as a result  volume production of our advanced process technologies at the new fabs of seiko epson  umc or future foundries may not be achieved 
this could harm our operating results 
in late  umc informed us that as part of an overall capacity rationalization they are planning to close certain of their fabrication facilities 
we were developing an advanced wafer manufacturing process at one of the umc fabs that has been closed 
with umc s support  we have transferred this process to alternative umc fabs 
however  transfer of a manufacturing process is a technically demanding and time intensive challenge 
as a result  our new product introduction schedules have been delayed 
this could harm our operating results 
our marketable securities  which we hold for strategic reasons  are subject to equity price risk and their value may fluctuate 
currently we hold substantial equity in umc corporation  which we acquired as part of a strategic investment to obtain certain manufacturing rights 
the market price and valuation of these equity shares has fluctuated widely due to market and other conditions over which we have little control 
during the quarter ended september   we recorded a million pre tax impairment loss related to this investment 
in the future  umc shares may continue to experience significant price volatility 
we have not attempted to reduce or eliminate this equity price risk through hedging or similar techniques and hence substantial  sustained changes in the market price of umc shares could impact our financial results 
to the extent that the market value of our umc shares experiences further deterioration for an extended period of time  our net income could be reduced 
our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate 
consequently  our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
as a result of industry conditions and the following specific factors  our quarterly operating results are more likely to fluctuate and are more difficult to predict than a typical non technology company of our size and maturity general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products  conditions within the end markets into which we sell our products  the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products  excessive inventory accumulation by our end customers  the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions  product obsolescence  the scheduling  rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at the new fabs of seiko epson  umc or at other foundries  changes in manufacturing yields  adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates or tax rates  and the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
as a result of these factors  our past financial results are not necessarily a good predictor of our future results 
our stock price may continue to experience large short term fluctuations 
in recent years  the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly 
these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe and have left investors little time to react 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  and announcements of technological innovations or new products by other companies 
our wafer supply may be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we do not manufacture finished silicon wafers 
currently  our silicon wafers are manufactured by seiko epson in japan  umc in taiwan  chartered semiconductor in singapore  agere systems and amd in the united states 
if seiko epson  through its us affiliate  epson electronics america  umc or chartered significantly interrupts or reduces our wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining wafers and in securing supply commitments from our foundries 
at present  we anticipate that our supply commitments are adequate 
however  these existing supply commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our supply commitments we may still have difficulty in obtaining wafer deliveries consistent with the supply commitments 
we negotiate wafer prices and supply commitments from our suppliers on at least an annual basis 
if any of seiko epson  epson electronics america  umc or chartered were to reduce its supply commitment or increase its wafer prices  and we cannot find alternative sources of wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
many other factors that could disrupt our wafer supply are beyond our control 
since worldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall wafer demand or interruptions in wafer supply 
additionally  a future disruption of seiko epson s  umc s or chartered s foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake or other natural disaster could disrupt our wafer supply and could harm our operating results 
if our foundry partners experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we depend on our foundries to deliver reliable silicon wafers with acceptable yields in a timely manner 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced wafer yield problems and delivery delays 
if our foundries are unable to produce silicon wafers that meet our specifications  with acceptable yields  for a prolonged period  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from products based on a specialized silicon wafer manufacturing process technology called e cmos 
the reliable manufacture of high performance e cmos semiconductor wafers is a complicated and technically demanding process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  the elimination of minute impurities and errors in each step of the fabrication process  and effective cooperation between the wafer supplier and the circuit designer 
as a result  our foundries may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when manufacturing our silicon wafers 
if our assembly and test subcontractors experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we rely on subcontractors to assemble and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced quality and yield problems in the past 
if we experience prolonged quality or yield problems in the future  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from semiconductor devices assembled in advanced packages 
the assembly of advanced packages is a complex process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in lead frames used to attach semiconductor devices to the package  the elimination of raw material impurities and errors in each step of the process  and effective cooperation between the assembly subcontractor and the device manufacturer 
as a result  our subcontractors may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when assembling and testing our semiconductor devices 
deterioration of conditions in asia may disrupt our existing supply arrangements and result in a shortage of finished products available for sale 
all three of our major silicon wafer suppliers operate fabs located in asia 
our finished silicon wafers are assembled and tested by independent subcontractors located in china  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  south korea  taiwan and thailand 
a prolonged interruption in our supply from any of these subcontractors could harm our operating results 
economic  financial  social and political conditions in asia have historically been volatile 
financial difficulties  governmental actions or restrictions  prolonged work stoppages or any other difficulties experienced by our suppliers may disrupt our supply and could harm our operating results 
our wafer purchases from seiko epson are denominated in japanese yen 
the value of the dollar with respect to the yen fluctuates 
substantial deterioration of dollar yen exchange rates could harm our operating results 
export sales account for a substantial portion of our revenues and may decline in the future due to economic and governmental uncertainties 
our export sales are affected by unique risks frequently associated with foreign economies including changes in local economic conditions  exchange rate volatility  governmental controls and trade restrictions  export license requirements and restrictions on the export of technology  political instability or terrorism  changes in tax rates  tariffs or freight rates  interruptions in air transportation  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales offices 
for example  our export sales have historically been affected by regional economic crises 
significant changes in the economic climate in the foreign countries where we derive our export sales could harm our operating results 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources 
if we are unable to compete successfully in this environment  our future results will be adversely affected 
the current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase as our market expands 
we currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our products and technology or have developed similar products 
we also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products and solutions based on alternative technologies 
these direct and indirect competitors are established multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies 
we also may experience significant competition from foreign companies in the future 
we may fail to retain or attract the specialized technical and management personnel required to successfully operate our business 
to a greater degree than most non technology companies or larger technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel 
as a mid sized company  we are particularly dependent on a relatively small group of key employees 
competition for skilled technical and management employees is intense within our industry 
as a result  we may not be able to retain our existing key technical and management personnel 
in addition  we may not be able to attract additional qualified employees in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unable to hire new qualified employees  our operating results could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results and competitive position may suffer 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
however  we may fail to adequately protect this technology 
as a result  we may lose our competitive position or face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
claims allowed on any of our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
patents issued to us also may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
finally  our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
companies in the semiconductor industry vigorously pursue their intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in protracted intellectual property disputes or litigation we may utilize substantial financial and management resources  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we may also be subject to future intellectual property claims or judgments 
if these were to occur  we may not be able to obtain a license on favorable terms or without our operating results being adversely affected 
critical accounting policies on december  and again on february  the securities and exchange commission proposed new corporate disclosure rules related to critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a description of our critical accounting policies follows 
revenue recognition 
revenue from direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and right of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and costs relating to such distributor sales are deferred until the product is sold by the distributor and related revenue and costs are then reflected in income 
deferred income 
in determining the amount of deferred income related to sales to distributors  we make estimates regarding sales prices and margins to be earned by our distributors upon sales to our end customers 
inventory and inventory valuation allowances 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market on a quarterly basis 
in addition  we establish reserves for unproven  excess and obsolete inventories 
to value our inventory  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including future price declines and forecasted demand for our products 
accounting for income taxes 
to report income tax expense related to operating results  we record current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our balance sheet 
in determining the value of our deferred tax assets  we make estimates of future taxable income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will earn sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets  and therefore  we do not provide for valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes new accounting treatment for derivatives and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing accounting standards 
we adopted this pronouncement in the first quarter of  such adoption did not and has not had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
sfas  among other things  establishes new standards for intangible assets acquired in a business combination  eliminates amortization of goodwill and sets forth requirements to periodically evaluate goodwill for impairment 
we will adopt this statement during the first quarter of  at which time goodwill and certain intangibles with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  eliminating approximately million of existing quarterly amortization 
amortization expense for the fourth quarter of and for the year ended december  was approximately and million  respectively 
as of december   the consolidated balance sheet caption intangible assets included approximately million of goodwill and million of net other intangible assets 
we will complete an initial goodwill impairment assessment in to determine if a transition impairment charge should be recognized under sfas we do not anticipate a material impairment charge upon the completion of the initial impairment review 
in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas regarding the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed by sale  but provides additional definition and measurement criteria for determining when an impairment has occurred 
goodwill and financial assets are excluded from the scope of sfas  however amortizable intangible assets fall within its scope 
we do not expect this pronouncement to materially affect our financial statements when we adopt it during the first quarter of item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and december  our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million and million  respectively 
as with all fixed income instruments  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  and december  the decline in the fair value of our portfolio would not be material 
further  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in our income or cash flows 
we have international subsidiary and branch operations 
additionally  a portion of our silicon wafer purchases are denominated in japanese yen 
we therefore are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to mitigate rate exposure with respect to our yen denominated wafer purchases  we maintain yen denominated bank accounts and bill our japanese customers in yen 
the yen bank deposits are utilized to hedge specific and firm yen denominated wafer purchases 
if the foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december  and december   the effect on our consolidated financial statements would not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 
we are exposed to equity price risk due to our equity investment in umc see note to our consolidated financial statements 
neither a increase nor a further decrease in equity price related to this investment would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we have not attempted to reduce or eliminate this equity price risk through hedging or similar techniques and hence substantial  sustained changes in the market price of umc shares could impact our financial results 
to the extent that the market value of our umc shares experiences further deterioration for an extended period of time  our net income could be reduced 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and short term investments  a slight decrease from the balance of million at december  working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to decreases in deferred income  accounts payable and accrued expenses  which more than offset a decrease in our accounts receivable 
these decreases were associated with the significant downturn in the semiconductor and pld markets during and our lower revenue and operating expense levels 
during  we generated approximately million of cash and cash equivalents from our operations compared with million during this reduction in cash generation was driven primarily by reduced receipts from end customers and distributors in conjunction with lower revenue levels and reduced cash inflow from stock option exercises 
accounts receivable at december  decreased by million  or  as compared to the balance at december  this decrease was primarily due to decreased billings and revenue levels during the year 
inventories increased by million  or nine percent  as compared to the balance at december  primarily due to lower revenue levels and the continued receipt of wafers started in the last half of wafer starts were significantly reduced throughout and inventory levels stabilized in the second half of prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by approximately million  or  as compared to the balance at december  this increase is due primarily to estimated income taxes paid in the first quarter of which are now refundable as a result of the pre tax loss recorded in the second through fourth quarters of current deferred tax assets decreased by approximately million  or  as compared to the balance at december  this was primarily due to the decrease in deferred income on sales to distributors which is recognized currently for income tax purposes  and to a lesser extent the timing of deductions for certain expenses and allowances 
foundry investments  advances and other assets decreased by approximately million  or as compared to the balance at december  this decrease was primarily due to market value depreciation of our investment in umc see note to our consolidated financial statements 
net intangible assets decreased by million  or as compared to the balance at december   primarily due to amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  partially offset by new intangible assets acquired during the period which are being amortized over four years 
amortization expense for these new assets totaled approximately million  including million of deferred compensation expense 
the increase in non current deferred income taxes of million  or  at december  as compared to december  is due primarily to a reduction of the deferred tax liability originally recorded on january  in conjunction with the gain recognized on the appreciation of our umc shares see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the balance of this deferred tax liability of million at december   was netted against non current deferred income tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
this liability was eliminated in the third quarter of as our impairment loss recognized in the third quarter of on the umc shares was slightly in excess of the original gain recorded 
in conjunction with the subsequent market appreciation of the umc shares in the fourth quarter of  a deferred tax liability of million was recorded 
the increase in non current deferred taxes is also due  to a lesser extent  to the net tax effect of intangible asset amortization 
accounts payable and accrued expenses at december  decreased by million  or  as compared to the balance at december  this decrease is due primarily to decreased wafer purchases and contracted assembly activities in response to decreased customer demand and revenue levels 
the million  or decrease in income taxes payable at december  as compared to the balance at december  is primarily attributable to the net loss recorded in and to the timing of tax deductions and payments 
deferred income at december  decreased by million  or  as compared to the balance at december   due primarily to decreased billings to distributors associated with decreased shipments and lower revenue levels 
on october   we issued million in convertible subordinated notes due on november  these notes require that we pay interest semi annually on may and november holders of these notes may convert them into shares of our common stock at any time on or before november   at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
beginning on november  and ending on october   we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at a redemption price of of the principal amount 
in the subsequent three twelve month periods  the redemption price declines to  and of principal  respectively 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness  and are subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries 
at december   we had no senior indebtedness and our subsidiaries had million of other liabilities 
issuance costs relative to the convertible subordinated notes are included in other assets and aggregated approximately million and are being amortized to expense over the life of the notes 
accumulated amortization amounted to approximately million at december  on june   we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders and abn amro bank nv as administrative agent for the lender group 
the credit agreement consisted of two credit facilities a million unsecured revolving credit facility revolver  and a million unsecured reducing term loan term loan  both expiring and due on june  on june   we borrowed million under the term loan and approximately million under the revolver 
the million revolver was repaid in full during the third calendar quarter of in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes  we repaid the million term loan in full during the fourth calendar quarter of fiscal remaining unamortized loan fees at the time of repayment  aggregating approximately million million net of income taxes or a charge of for basic and diluted earnings per share  were written off and are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations as an extraordinary item  net of income taxes 
we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million for  and fiscal period  respectively 
we expect to spend approximately million to million for the fiscal year ending december  certain of our facilities and equipment are leased under operating leases  which expire at various times through rental expense under the operating leases was approximately million  million and million for   and fiscal period  respectively 
future minimum lease commitments at december  are as follows in thousands year later years included in these amounts are certain properties which are currently subleased 
a portion of this sublease income is payable to the property owner 
future minimum sublease receipts  based on agreements in place at december   net of such payments are as follows in thousands year we currently own approximately million shares of umc common stock 
restrictions by umc and the taiwan government apply to approximately of these shares 
if we liquidate our umc shares  it is likely that the amount of any future realized gain or loss will be different from the accounting gain or loss reported in prior periods 
in december  our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to five million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares  in at an aggregate cost of approximately million million in 
in march and as subsequently amended in january  we entered into an advance payment production agreement with seiko epson and epson electronics america  inc eea under which we agreed to advance approximately million  payable upon completion of specific milestones  to seiko epson to finance construction of an eight inch sub micron semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility 
under the terms of the agreement  the advance is to be repaid with semiconductor wafers over a multi year period 
no interest income is recorded 
the agreement calls for wafers to be supplied by seiko epson through eea pursuant to purchase agreements with eea 
payments of approximately million have been made under this agreement 
approximately million of these advances are expected to be repaid with semiconductor wafers during fiscal year and are thus reflected as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
on december   we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the fpga business of agere systems  inc for million in cash 
this acquisition was completed on january  and financed with cash on hand 
the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase 
the acquisition includes a general purpose orca fpga product portfolio  a field programmable system chip fpsc product portfolio and all related software design tools 
in addition  we also acquired certain intellectual property cores and patents unique to agere s fpga business and entered into a cross license agreement with agere covering certain fpga and fpsc patents  intellectual property and technology 
as part of the transaction  we also hired approximately agere product development  marketing and technical sales employees 
the million purchase price  associated costs and assumed liabilities are tax deductible over years for substantially all of the sum 
management  with the assistance of a third party valuation of intangible assets  attributed million to purchased technology  million to in process research and development costs  and million to a non compete agreement and to licensed technology 
value attributed to acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities is not material to our financial statements 
goodwill is the difference between a the sum of the purchase price  associated costs and assumed liabilities  and b the fair value of acquired assets 
purchased and licensed non goodwill intangible assets will be amortized over approximately years on a straight line basis except in process research and development costs which will be charged to operations in the march quarter 
we believe that our existing liquid resources  expected cash generated from operations and existing credit facilities combined with our ability to borrow additional funds will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the next months  including our recent acquisition of the agere fpga business 
we may in the future seek new or additional sources of funding 
in addition  in order to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including joint ventures  equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution
