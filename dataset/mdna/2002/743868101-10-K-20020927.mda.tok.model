general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the corporation 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in item of this report 
provident savings bank  fsb  is a wholly owned subsidiary of provident financial holdings  inc and as such  comprises substantially all of the activity for provident financial holdings  inc certain matters in this annual report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements relate to  among others  expectations of the business environment in which the corporation operates  projections of future performance  perceived opportunities in the market  potential future credit experience  and statements regarding the corporation s mission and vision 
these forward looking statements are based upon current management expectations  and may  therefore  involve risks and uncertainties 
the corporation s actual results  performance  or achievements may differ materially from those suggested  expressed  or implied by forward looking statements due to a wide range of factors including  but not limited to  the general business environment  the direction of future interest rates  the california real estate market  competitive conditions between banks and non bank financial services providers  regulatory changes  labor market competitiveness  and other risks detailed in the corporation s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of net loans 
management considers this accounting policy to be a critical accounting policy 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment as described in provision for loan losses 
interest is generally not accrued on any loan when its contractual payments are more than days delinquent 
in addition  interest is not recognized on any loan which management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured 
a non accrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current  the loan is paying in accordance with its payment terms for a minimum six month period  and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected 
properties acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure  are transferred to the real estate owned portfolio and carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated costs to sell the property 
the fair values of the properties are based upon current appraisals 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs additional valuations and the properties are adjusted  if necessary  to the lower of carrying value or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value includes revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  construction and renovation costs 
operating strategy provident savings bank  fsb  established in  is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid sized businesses in the inland empire region of southern california 
the bank conducts its business operations as provident bank  pbm and through its subsidiary  pfc 
thus  the business activities of the corporation consist of community banking  mortgage banking  investment services and real estate operations 
the corporation has established strategies for the next five years  which will change the composition and diversify its balance sheet  diversify its revenue sources  create operating efficiencies  and deploy more aggressive capital management techniques 
the corporation intends to restructure its balance sheet by decreasing the concentration of single family mortgage loans within its loan portfolio and increasing the concentration of multi family  commercial real estate  construction and commercial business loans 
the corporation also intends to decrease the percentage of time deposits in its deposit base and to increase the percentage of checking and savings deposits 
this strategy is intended to improve core revenue through a higher net interest margin 
the corporation also intends to diversify revenue sources through continued growth of non interest income  which is primarily income from mortgage banking  fees from banking products and services  revenue from investment sales  and revenue from real estate operations 
the corporation intends to create operating efficiencies by streamlining processes and procedures  deploying technology solutions to improve productivity  leveraging its infrastructure to support revenue growth and conducting benchmark studies which will determine opportunities to reduce operating expenses 
the corporation intends to deploy more aggressive capital management techniques such as share repurchases and a cash dividend policy  among others  resulting in higher earnings per share 
the corporation is involved in various legal matters associated with its normal operations 
in the opinion of management  these matters will be resolved without material effect on the corporation s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
commitments and derivative financial instruments the corporation conducts a portion of its operations in leased facilities under non cancelable agreements classified as operating leases 
the following is a schedule of minimum rental payments under such operating leases which expire at various years year ended june  amount dollars in thousands thereafter total minimum payments required lease expense under operating leases was approximately   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  in the form of originating loans or providing funds under existing lines of credit  and forward loan sale agreements to third parties 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the corporation s exposure to credit loss  in the event of non performance by the other party to these financial instruments  is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
june  commitments in thousands undisbursed loan funds construction loans undisbursed lines of credit commercial business loans undisbursed lines of credit consumer loans commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to a customer at some future date as long as all conditions have been met in the agreement 
these commitments generally have expiration dates within days of the commitment date and may require the payment of a fee 
since some of these commitments are expected to expire  the total commitment amount outstanding does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the corporation evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis prior to issuing a commitment 
at june  and  interest rates on commitments to extend credit ranged from to and to  respectively 
commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for investment were million and million at june  and  respectively 
in an effort to minimize its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on commitments to extend credit where the underlying loan will be sold  the corporation enters into forward loan sale agreements to sell certain dollar amounts of fixed rate and adjustable rate loans to third parties 
these agreements specify the minimum maturity of the loans  the yield to the purchaser  the servicing spread to the corporation if servicing is retained  the maximum principal amount of all loans to be delivered and the maximum principal amount of individual loans to be delivered 
the corporation typically satisfies these forward loan sale agreements with its current loan production  at june  and the aggregate amount of loans held for sale and of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale exceeded the corporation s forward loan sale agreements 
at june  and  interest rates on forward loan sale agreements ranged from to and to  respectively 
in addition to the instruments described above  the corporation also purchases over the counter put option contracts with expiration dates that generally coincide with the terms of the commitments to extend credit which mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in commitments to extend credit 
the contract amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the corporation has in this particular class of financial instruments 
the corporation s exposure to loss on these financial instruments is limited to the premiums paid for the put option contracts 
put options are adjusted to market in accordance with sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
and interpretations of the derivative implementation group  the fair value of the commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale  forward loan sale agreements and put option contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet  and are included in other assets or other liabilities 
as of june   commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale were not interpreted to be derivatives 
as such  these amounts were not included on the balance sheet as of june  the corporation is not applying hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments  therefore  all changes in fair value are recorded in earnings 
the net impact of derivative financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations during the years ended june  and was and  respectively

comparison of financial condition at june  and june  total assets decreased slightly from billion at june  to billion at june  primarily as a result of a decrease in loans held for investment 
the loans held for investment decreased million from million at june  to million at june  primarily as a result of loan prepayments 
these prepayments were attributable to the extraordinarily high volume of refinance activity during fiscal in connection with the low interest rate environment 
the receivable from sale of loans decreased million from million at june  to million at june   resulting from the timing difference between loan sales and loan settlements 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in investment securities from million at june  to million at june  the bank originated approximately billion in new loans  primarily through its mortgage division  and purchased million in loans from other financial institutions 
the provident bank mortgage loan production is sold primarily servicing released  a total of billion was sold during fiscal the outstanding balance of loans held for sale decreased from million at june  to million at june  the outstanding balance of loans held for sale is largely dependent on the timing of loan fundings and loan sales

total stockholders equity was million at june   as compared to million at june  the million increase in stockholders equity during fiscal from net income was partially offset by share repurchases 
the corporation repurchased  shares  or approximately of outstanding shares  at an average price of per share  totaling million in fiscal the corporation s book value per share increased from at june  to at june  comparison of operating results for the years ended june  and general 
the corporation had net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended june   as compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended june  the increase in operating earnings in fiscal was primarily attributable to an improvement in non interest income 
net interest income 
net interest income increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase resulted principally from an increase in net interest margin 
the net interest margin increased from an average of in fiscal to an average of in fiscal the increase in the net interest margin was primarily attributable to a decrease in short term interest rates during fiscal where the decrease in the costs of interest bearing liabilities was greater than that of the decrease in income from earning assets 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as the average earning assets decreased million  or  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the average yield on assets also decreased basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal average loan balances decreased million  or  from million during fiscal to million during fiscal and the average yield decreased basis points from to  respectively

these loans generally have greater risk than single family mortgage loans 
management believes that the current provision for loan losses is prudent and based upon the loan portfolio composition  historic loss experience and current economic conditions 
non interest income 
total non interest income increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in non interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in gain on the sale of loans  along with increases in loan servicing and other fees  deposit account fees and other income 
total gain from sale of loans increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and was the result of higher loan origination volume  partially offset by a lower average loan sale margin 
total loans originated for sale increased million  or  from million in fiscal to billion in fiscal the average loan sale margin decreased basis points to during fiscal from during fiscal the increase on the gain on sale of loans was primarily due to a strong refinance market as interest rates declined during fiscal loan servicing and othe r fees increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  resulting primarily from an increase in loan prepayment fees  which was partly offset by lower loan servicing fees 
the decline in the loan servicing fees was a result of a lower volume of loans serviced for others  million as of june  as compared to million as of june  deposit account fees increased  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in deposit account fees was the direct result of the bank s deposit strategy which emphasizes transaction account growth 
other non interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  resulting primarily from higher gain on sales of investment securities 
non interest expense 
total non interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase was attributable primarily to increases in compensation expenses  occupancy  equipment and professional expenses  and was partially offset by lower marketing and other operating expenses

comparison of operating results for the years ended june  and general 
the corporation had net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended june   as compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended june  the increase in operating earnings in fiscal was primarily attributable to an improvement in non interest income  partially offset by a reduction in net interest income and slightly higher operating expenses 
net interest income 
net interest income decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease resulted principally from a decrease in the net interest margin 
the net interest margin declined from an average of in fiscal to an average of in fiscal the decline in the net interest margin was primarily attributable to an increase in short term interest rates during fiscal where the increase in the costs of interest bearing liabilities was greater than that of the increase in income from earning assets 
interest income

total non interest income increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in non interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in gain on the sale of loans  along with an increase in other income  and was partially offset by a decrease in loan servicing and other fees 
total gain from sale of loans increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and was the result of higher loan origination volume  a higher average loan sale margin and the sfas no 
favorable adjustments of  total loans originated for sale increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the average loan sale margin increased basis points to during fiscal from during fiscal the increase on the gain on sale of loans was primarily due to the strong refinance market beginning in january when interest rates began to decline 
other non interest income increased by  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  resulting primarily from higher gain on sales of investment securities 
total loan servicing and other fees declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  resulting primarily from a decline in broker fees and loan servicing fees

liquidity and capital resources the corporation s primary sources of funds are deposits  proceeds from the sale of loans originated for sale  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  proceeds from the maturity of investment securities and fhlb advances 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows  mortgage prepayments and loan sales are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to support loan growth and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the bank generally maintains sufficient cash to meet short term liquidity needs 
at june   cash totaled million  or of total assets 
depending on market conditions and the pricing of deposit products and fhlb advances  the bank may continue to partly rely on fhlb advances for its liquidity needs 
even though the ots eliminated the minimum liquidity requirement for savings institutions in april  the regulation still requires thrifts to maintain adequate liquidity to assure safe and sound operations 
the bank s average liquidity ratio for the quarter ended june  increased to from during the same period ending june  this increase was primarily due to the unexpected cash flow generated from the large volume of loan prepayments  which were reinvested in qualifying liquid instruments 
the primary investing activity of the bank is the origination of multi family  commercial real estate  construction  and commercial business loans 
most mortgage and consumer loans originated by pbm were sold including servicing rights 
during the years ended june   and  the bank originated loans in the amounts of billion  million and million  respectively 
in addition  the bank purchased loans from other financial institutions in fiscal  and in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively 
total loans sold by pbm in fiscal  and were billion  million and million  respectively 
at june   the bank had loan origination commitments totaling million and undisbursed loans in process totaling million 
the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments 
time deposits that are scheduled to mature in one year or less from june  were million 
historically  the bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its time deposits as they mature 
management of the bank believes it has adequate resources to fund all loan commitments with deposits and fhlb advances  and that it can adjust deposit rates to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments 
the bank is required to maintain specific amounts of capital pursuant to ots requirements 
under ots s current prompt corrective action provisions  the minimum ratio of for tangible capital ratio is required to be deemed other than critically undercapitalized  while a minimum of for tier core capital  for total risk based capital and for tier risk based capital ratios are deemed well capitalized 
as of june   the bank was well in excess of all regulatory capital requirements with tangible capital  core capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital ratios of   and  respectively 
impact of inflation and changing prices the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increasing cost of the corporation s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all assets and liabilities of the corporation are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the corporation s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative aspects of market risk 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does it purchase high risk derivative financial instruments 
furthermore  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
for information regarding the sensitivity to interest rate risk of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  see the tables under item business lending activities maturity of loan portfolio  investment activities and deposit activities and other sources of funds time deposits by maturities contained herein 
qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to decrease the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets by retaining for its portfolio new loan originations with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and by selling fixed rate  single family mortgage loans 
in addition  the bank maintains an investment portfolio which is largely in us government agency securities and us government agency mbs with contractual maturities of up to years 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits  compared to brokered deposi ts  reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts and time deposits with terms up to five years 
for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein and the information provided below 
asset and liability management 
the principal financial objective of the corporation s interest rate risk management function is to achieve long term profitability while limiting its exposure to the fluctuation of interest rates 
the corporation  through its alco  has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by managing the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to manage the interest rate sensitivity of the corporation s assets by retaining loans with interest rates subject to periodic market adjustments 
in addition  the bank maintains a liquid investment portfolio comprised of government agency securities and mbs 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funding while utilizing fhlb advances as a secondary source of funding 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts and time deposits with terms up to five years 
using data from the bank s quarterly report to the ots  the bank receives a report that measures interest rate risk by modeling the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
the interest rate analysis received from the ots is similar to the bank s own interest rate analysis model 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the calculation is intended to illustrate the change in npv that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of at least  and basis points with no effect given to any steps which management might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
the following table is provided by the ots and sets forth as of june  the estimated changes in npv based on the indicated interest rate environments 
the bank s balance sheet position as of june  is as follows if interest rates increase  the npv of the bank is expected to decrease and future net interest income would decrease  conversely  if interest rates decrease  the npv of the bank is expected to decrease but future net interest income would increase 
npv as percentage net npv portfolio of portfolio value sensitivity basis points bp portfolio change value assets measure change in rates value assets dollars in thousands bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp represents the decrease of the estimated npv at the indicated change in interest rates compared to the npv calculated at june  base case 
calculated as the estimated npv divided by the portfolio value of total assets 
calculated as the change in the npv ratio from the base case at the indicated change in interest rates 
the following table provided by the ots  is based on the calculations contained in the previous table  and sets forth the change in the npv at a bp 
rate shock at june  and risk measure bp rate shock at june  at june  pre shock npv ratio post shock npv ratio sensitivity measure bp bp as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing characteristics  they may react in different degrees to changes in interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
it is also possible that  as a result of an interest rate increase  the increased mortgage payments required of arm borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults 
changes in interest rates could also affect the volume and profitability of the corporation s mortgage banking operations 
accordingly  the data presented in the tables above should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates 
furthermore  the npv presented in the foregoing tables is not intended to present the fair market value of the bank  nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to stockholders in the event of the liquidation of the corporation

the following table sets forth certain information for the periods regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest earning assets and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and average yields and costs thereof
