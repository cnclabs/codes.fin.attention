item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of the company s business insurance and insurance services and whereas company growth does not normally require material reinvestments of profits into property or equipment  the cash flow generated from operations usually results in improved liquidity for the company 
because the company is a holding company and operates through its subsidiaries  its cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distributions of those earnings to the company 
the most significant liquidity risk faced by the company would be continued adverse development of the insurance company claims  both reported and unreported 
the company has taken measures to address the underlying causes of the adverse development  however  no assurance can be given that the measures taken will be successful or that the company s estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will be sufficient 
based on the company s current loss and loss expense reserves and expected current and future payments  the company believes that there are no current liquidity issues 
crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves  its reserves for loss payments  and its capital and surplus 
crusader s loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the company 
these payments are continually monitored and projected to ensure that the company has the liquidity to cover these payments without the need to liquidate its investments 
cash and investments excluding net unrealized gains or losses at december   were  compared to  at december   a decrease 
crusader s cash and investments at december   was  or of the total held by the company  compared to  or of the total held by the company at december  the company s investments are as follows december  december  december  amount amount amount fixed maturities at amortized cost certificates of deposit    us treasury securities    industrial and miscellaneous taxable    state and municipal tax exempt    total fixed maturity investments    short term cash investments at cost certificates of deposit    commercial paper   bank money market accounts    us gov t obligation money market fund    short term us treasury   bank savings accounts    total short term cash investments    equity investments at cost   total investments    in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company is required to classify its investments in debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
although all of the company s investments are classified as available for sale  the company s investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity 
the tax exempt interest income earned net of bond premium and discount amortization during the year ended december   was  compared to  in the year ended december  in the year ended december   tax exempt interest income earned totaled  the company s investment policy limits investments in any one company to  this limitation excludes bond premiums paid in excess of par value and us government or us government guaranteed issues

unico has a  line of credit with union bank of california 
interest on this line is referenced as bank s libor rate plus per annum and is payable monthly 
the agreement contains certain covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios 
as of december   the company does not meet the covenant requiring a tangible net worth of at least  as of december  and  no amounts were borrowed and the company does not intend to utilize its credit line during the remainder of its current term 
this credit line expires september   at which time it s expected to be renegotiated and renewed 
there were no dividends paid by crusader to unico in crusader paid dividends of  in and  in the dividends paid in and were invested in short term instruments and were ultimately used to help fund the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock discussed below 
as of december   the maximum dividend that could have been made by crusader to unico without the prior approval of the california department of insurance was  the company has previously announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase in the open market from time to time of up to an aggregate of  shares of the common stock of the company see note 
during the year ended december   the company retired an aggregate of  shares of its common stock at a cost of  of this amount   came from cash on hand and the proceeds from the maturities of short term investments and  from the proceeds of the sale of us treasury notes 
as of december   the company has purchased and retired under the board of directors authorization an aggregate of  shares of its common stock at a cost of  crusader s statutory capital and surplus as of december   was  a decrease of  from december  on march   subsequent to crusader s statutory filing  the job creation and workers assistance act of was signed into law 
this act was effective for tax years ending in and provided that a net operating loss for tax year ending in or is carried back five years  rather than the previously allowed two years 
the income tax credit resulting from net operating loss carrybacks are treated as current receivables while income tax credit resulting from the net operating loss carryforwards  subject to limitations  are treated as deferred tax assets and are limited to an aggregate amount no greater than of beginning surplus 
as of december   crusader reported to the california department of insurance in its annual statutory filing  total deferred tax assets of  of which  was admitted and included in surplus and  was non admitted and not included in surplus 
this act allowed crusader to carryback its entire net operating loss and thus converted its net operating loss carryforward of  to a current receivable 
this reduced the total deferred tax assets to  of which  were admitted and  were non admitted 
taking into consideration the job creation and workers assistance act of  the primary effect of the act was to increase crusader s surplus by  crusader s statutory capital and surplus as of december   was  a decrease of  from december  cash flow used by operations for the year ended december   was  a slight decrease of  in cash used compared to the year ended december  cash flow used by operations for the year ended december   was  a decrease of  from the  of cash provided by operations in the year ended december  the decline in cash flows from operations in was primarily due an increase in loss and loss adjustment payments of  the company has initiated an upgrade and replacement of its printing and forms generation systems and expects to spend approximately  in the next twelve months to complete this project 
there are no other material commitments for capital expenditures as of the date of this report 
although material capital expenditures may also be funded through borrowings  the company believes that its cash and short term investments at year end  net of trust restriction of  statutory deposits of  and dividend restriction between crusader and unico see item business insurance company operation holding company act plus the cash to be generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet its operating requirements during the next twelve months without the necessity of borrowing funds 
results of operations general the company had a net loss of  for the year ended december   compared to net income of  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  total revenue for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company had a loss before taxes of  compared to income before taxes of  in the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in pre tax income was primarily due to a decrease of  in the underwriting profit net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader 
the company had a net loss for the year ended december   of  compared to net income of  for the year ended december   a decrease in net income of  for the year ended december   the company had income before taxes of  compared to income before taxes of  in the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in pre tax income was primarily due to a decrease of  in the underwriting profit net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader 
the company had net income for the year ended december   of  compared to net income of  for the year ended december   a decrease in net income of  the progressive decrease in operating results both from year to year and successive quarters during the two years ended december   is primarily attributable to the successive increases to loss and loss adjustments expense reserves related to prior periods  as discussed below under insurance company operation 
in addition to increasing its estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses  the company has taken various underwriting and pricing actions that it believes addresses the underlying causes of the adverse development discussed below and which has given rise to the successive periods of decline in operating results 
no assurance can be given that the actions taken will be successful or that the company s estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will be sufficient 
changes in such estimates  if any  will be recorded in the period they occur 
the effect of inflation on the net income of the company during the years ended december  and was not significant 
the company derives revenue from various sources as discussed below insurance company operation premium and loss information of crusader are as follows year ended december gross written premium    net written premium net of reinsurance ceded    earned premium before reinsurance ceded    earned premium net of reinsurance ceded    losses and loss adjustment expenses    unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses    crusader s primary line of business is commercial multiple peril business package policies 
this line of business represented approximately of crusader s total written premium for the year ended december   and of crusaders total premium in the years ended december  and the company s future writings and growth are dependent on market conditions  competition  and the company s ability to introduce new and profitable products 
as of december   crusader was licensed as an admitted insurance company in the states of arizona  california  colorado  idaho  montana  nevada  ohio  oregon  and washington and is approved as a non admitted surplus lines writer in other states 
crusader s gross written premium by state is as follows year ended december california    ohio    arizona    washington    pennsylvania    montana    oregon    nevada    texas    idaho   kentucky    total gross written premium    for the year ended december   gross written premium increased by  compared to the year ended december  approximately of the company s premium is written in the state of california  which accounted for of the increase in gross written premium 
although the company increased its rates on its liquor liability coverages outside of california and nevada in  it was not a material factor in the growth in gross written premium in the growth in written premium in was primarily the result of the subsidence in the intensity of price based competition in the property and casualty insurance market that has resulted in the company s products becoming more competitive 
the company s policy count has increased approximately while gross written premium has increased 
for the year ended december   gross written premium increased by  compared to the year ended december  this slight increase was primarily due to the subsidence in the intensity of price based competition that began in although the company attempts to be competitive on price  it believes that maintaining adequate rates on the insurance policies it sells is a better business strategy than increasing total written premium by selling more policies at inadequate rates 
although it appears that the intensity of price based competition has somewhat subsided  the company does not believe that it is in a hard market 
while some of its competitors have gone out of business  others have recently raised rates or adopted more restrictive rules 
those changes have not yet been large enough to significantly redirect the flow of new business to the company 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue  nor in which direction they might change 
the company continues to believe that it can compete effectively and profitably by offering better service and by marketing its policies through its current independent agents and brokers 
in pursuing its growth plan  the company adopted a geographic expansion plan several years ago 
in  of the company s sales were in california 
as of december   the company had established marketing relations and products in ten other states  decreasing the percentage of its california business to 
the company has no short term plan to expand into additional states  nor to expand its marketing channels 
however  the company does plan to adopt fine tuning changes to its existing rates  rules and forms 
the company writes annual policies and  therefore  earns written premium daily over the one year policy term 
premium earned before reinsurance increased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and decreased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in earned premium before reinsurance in was directly related to the increase in written premium in the current year 
the decrease in earned premium in the years and was directly related to the decrease in written premium in the years and earned premium ceded decreased  to  or of earned premium before reinsurance in the year ended december   compared to  or of earned premium before reinsurance for the year ended december  earned premium ceded increased  to  or of earned premium before reinsurance for the year ended december   compared to  or of earned premium before reinsurance for the year ended december  ceded premiums decreased in the year ended december   primarily as a result of a decrease in ceded premium ceded under the company s provisionally rated reinsurance contract 
premium ceded under the company s provisionally rated reinsurance contract  which was canceled on a runoff basis effective december   is subject to adjustments based on the amount of losses ceded  limited by a maximum percentage that can be charged by the reinsurer 
this decrease in ceded premiums was partially offset by an increase in premium ceded to the company s primary reinsurance contract as a result of the related increase in earned premiums 
ceded premiums increased in the year ended december   primarily due to higher than anticipated loss experience on prior accident years that was subject to the company s provisionally rated reinsurance contract 
the decrease in earned ceded premium excluding provisionally rated ceded premium in and was primarily due to decreased earned premium before reinsurance 
the following table shows the changes in ceded premium year ended december increase decrease in earned ceded premium excluding provisionally rated ceded premium    increase decrease in provisionally rated ceded premium    net increase decrease in earned ceded premium    primarily due to ceded loss experience  crusader s reinsurance cost is expected to increase in due to a rate increase of approximately on its excess of loss treaties 
in addition  reinsurance costs are expected to increase due to an increase of approximately on its catastrophe treaties 
without taking into account premium growth  this rate increase  net of ceding commission  will cost approximately  in addition  the annual aggregate deductible will increase from  in to  in in  the company s reinsurance coverage for terrorism  mold and cyber risk has been significantly reduced 
to the extent allowed by regulators  the company intends to address this change in its reinsurance coverage by modifying the coverage provided to its policyholders 
the combined ratio is the sum of the net ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred including a provision for incurred but not reported losses ibnr to net premiums earned loss ratio and the ratio of policy acquisition and general operating costs to net premiums earned expense ratio 
the following table shows the loss ratios  expense ratios  and combined ratios of crusader as derived from data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as shown on the table below  the loss ratio increased to in from in and in this increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to an increase in prior years incurred losses 
generally  if the combined ratio is below  an insurance company has an underwriting profit  if it is above  a company has an underwriting loss 
year ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance were  at december   compared to  at december   and  at december  the increase in reserves at december  and reflect both an increase in claim severities and adverse development of prior years in the company s commercial multiple peril cmp and other liability lines of business 
the adverse development of prior years losses was primarily the result of an increase in the company s estimate of ultimate reported and unreported claims for construction defects  non california liquor liability and apartment house habitability as described below 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance are as follows year ended december line of business cmp    other liability    other    total    in the years ended december  and  the company increased its estimates of ultimate losses for both reported and unreported claims primarily occurring from through and from through the years most impacted by construction defect claims 
adverse development of prior years losses of  as of december  and  as of december   was primarily the result of an increase in the company s estimate of ultimate reported and unreported claims for construction defect claims  non california liquor liability claims and apartment house habitability claims 
construction defect claims arise from the liability of contractors for their defective work in the construction of habitation structures such as apartments  condominiums and single family dwellings or commercial type structures 
liquor liability claims arise from the liability of tavern owners related to the sale of alcoholic beverages 
apartment house habitability claims arise from uninhabitable conditions related to dilapidated structures and insect and vermin infestation 
the increase in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses recognized in and was primarily due to the following higher than anticipated claim cost from business outside of california 
the effect on settlements of escalating jury awards 
the effect on settlements in apartment house habitability claims due to a statute that provide for payment of plaintiff attorney fees without regard to policy limits 
increased development of losses due to the impact of changes in california law that expanded coverage and increased loss exposure primarily on construction defect claims for losses incurred prior to the company s revision in its policy form in for example montrose chemical corp 
v 
admiral insurance co 
 montrose chemical corp 
v 
admiral insurance co 
 armstrong world industries  inc v 
aetna gas sur 
co 
and james pepperell  et al  v 
scottsdale insurance company 
these four cases state that all insurance companies with completed operations property damage coverage in force during a period of continuing damage or property deterioration must provide coverage for construction defect losses regardless as to whether or not the damage first manifested during their policy period 
pardee construction company v 
insurance company of the west et al  this case states that an additional insured endorsement includes completed operations property damage coverage even for projects that were completed before the inception date of the endorsement 
centex golden construction co 
v 
dale tile co 
this case states that indemnity agreements in construction contracts requires the subcontractor to defend the general contractor even though the subcontractor s liability has not been established 
in  the provision for incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for events of prior years turned from favorable to adverse 
estimates for ultimate loss reserves are inherently difficult to determine because they are attempts to quantify future results based on current trends 
the effort to predict the company s ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses has been made more difficult in and because of the following the company had written liquor liability outside of california since the time allowed by statute to report a claim in these states ranges from years to years 
prior to  the frequency and severity of the claims seemed reasonably predictable 
before the statute of limitations expired  claims occurring in that were reported to the company in were significantly higher than anticipated based on the company s loss experience for all prior years in which these coverages were offered 
the company could not identify any reason for this change and was unable to tell whether it was an aberration or a new trend 
although the company increased its reserves  they were not enough to cover the claims reported in for losses occurring in prior to  the company s loss development studies included this line of business with its commercial multiple peril package business 
to better isolate the change in development of its non california liquor liability business  the company developed separate actuarial studies during based on these studies  the company substantially increased its reserves for both its reported and unreported claims on its non california liquor liability business 
in  the company responded to the change in development in and by either substantial increased rates or reducing coverages offered on this business 
prior to  the company was writing a wide variety of general contractors and subcontractors in california 
in  california law relating to contractors changed significantly as a consequence of various california legal decisions 
the effect of these changes was to expand coverages and increase loss exposure 
although the company modified its policy forms and underwriting standards relating to its contractor business in  it could not change the exposure on the policies already written 
the assumptions made and the trends used by the company in estimating its reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses in and have been relatively untested by time and actual development of its reserves 
although the company increased its reserves in  construction defect claims on its contractor business for and prior continued to be reported in in amounts greater than the company anticipated 
prior to  the company included this line of business in its commercial multiple peril business package development studies 
to better isolate the effect of the above changes  the company developed separate actuarial studies on its contractor line of business during based on these studies  the company substantially increased its reserves for both its reported and unreported claims on its contractor business 
in and  the company began experiencing adverse development on its apartment house business due to the effect of settlements on habitability claims 
those settlements were substantially influenced by a statute that provides for the payment of plaintiff attorney fees without regard to policy limits and the montrose chemical corp 
v 
admiral insurance company decision of in  the company modified its underwriting criteria to address this adverse development and intends to modify its policy form to limit the statutory attorney fee exposure 
primarily as a result of the underwriting losses in and  the am best company recently lowered crusader s rating from a excellent to a excellent 
am best remains concerned with the potential for further adverse loss reserve development and the negative impact it would have on the company s operating performance and overall capitalization 
as a result  am best views the rating outlook as negative 
the company does not believe that the lowering of crusader s rating from a to a will have a material adverse effect on the company

changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonable predictable than long tail liability claims 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported
