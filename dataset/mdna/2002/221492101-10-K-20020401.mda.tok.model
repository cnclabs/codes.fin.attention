overview cost u less began operations in by opening a mid sized warehouse club style store in maui  hawaii 
the company s store concept was successful in the smaller  and in many ways more challenging  island markets 
the company began experimenting in late with similar stores in various mainland markets 
over the course of a three year period  the company opened six mainland stores and seven island stores 
however  the company found that most of the mainland stores did not meet the company s performance expectations 
the company therefore focused on its core competencies in operating island stores and began closing its mainland stores 
currently only one mainland store remains open and serves as an efficient testing ground for new operating and merchandising methods 
the company intends to retain this store while targeting its future growth on island markets 
in  the company opened two stores in fiji  and in the company opened two stores in new zealand and one in curacao  netherland antilles 
during fiscal  the company focused on improving its mix of stores in its relatively small store base  as under performing stores may have a materially adverse impact on company performance 
in june  the company closed its two new zealand stores and in february  the company closed its nadi  fiji store 
although  the company had introduced what it believed to be the first warehouse club concept to the new zealand marketplace  the company believes that the loyalty of new zealand customers to many regional brands resulted in disappointing sales of the us brands primarily sold by the company s two stores 
the company closed the nadi store primarily due to the impact that the political turmoil in fiji was having on the tourist industry 
the resulting economic downturn severely impacted the performance of its store in nadi 
these actions were in line with the company s strategy of evaluating its existing locations and operations in an effort to improve profitability and cash flow 
on june  the company opened a store on the island of st 
maarten in the caribbean 
the company believes this island market has market conditions that resemble those in islands in which the company has been successful 
during the remainder of fiscal  the company focused on improving the operations and merchandising of its eleven stores 
the company currently operates eleven retail stores two stores in hawaii and guam and one store in each of st 
thomas  st 
croix  american samoa  fiji  curacao  st 
maarten and sonora  california 
the company s stores are patterned after the warehouse club concept  although the stores i are smaller averaging approximately  square feet vs 
large format warehouse clubs of approximately  square feet  ii generally target niche markets  mainly foreign island countries and us territories and us island states  where demographics do not support large format warehouse clubs  iii carry a wide assortment of local and ethnic food items  and iv do not charge a membership fee 
although the company does not have large seasonal fluctuations in sales  the fourth quarter is typically the highest sales quarter due to additional holiday sales 
in  the company has continued its focus on its core island store operations 
the company has also been reviewing its merchandising strategies  both those that apply to all stores and those specific to each store in light of the different conditions in each market 
currently  the company has no plans to open new stores during  but is in the procees of analyzing opportunities for future expansion 
while management believes these actions can improve profitability  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful 
on march   the company announced that it had determined that the previous accounting treatment historically afforded its foreign currency translation adjustment associated with new zealand was not consistent with paragraph of statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas 
in june the company discontinued all major business activity in new zealand upon the closure of its two stores and its auckland buying office 
although the company had discontinued store and corporate buying activities in june  for the remainder of and through the first three quarters of  it continued to base its conclusion that the new zealand operations were not substantially liquidated on the fact that the company was still purchasing inventory through the new zealand subsidiary and negotiating final lease terms on the closed store leases 
the company now believes that  because the level of the ongoing new zealand activities was so small relative to activities prior to the closures  that substantial liquidation  as interpreted in paragraph of fas  had in fact occurred in june  and therefore the new zealand foreign currency translation account should have been written off at that time 
the restatement is a result of the company s re evaluation of the accounting interpretation and application of fas  and not the result of any improper conduct by company personnel or lack of internal controls 
as a result  the new zealand foreign currency translation adjustments of  which were previously recorded within other comprehensive income loss  have been written off at june   and are included in the store closure expense of  in fiscal concurrent with this reassessment  other related foreign currency translation adjustments have also been restated to reclassify that portion of intercompany transactions that represent transactions and balances that are not considered to be part of the net investment in the foreign entity  and accordingly  related transaction gains and losses are recorded for that portion representing non permanent investments 
resulting foreign currency transaction losses of  are included in other expenses of  in fiscal refer to the company s form k a for the year ended december   for a further discussion of the impact of the restatement
