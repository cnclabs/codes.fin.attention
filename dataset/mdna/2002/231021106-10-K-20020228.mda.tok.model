market risk the company is exposed to financial risk resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices

as clearly stated in the company s policies and procedures  financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes

note to the consolidated financial statements contains further information regarding financial instruments and risk management 
the following describes the company s risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed on december  the sensitivity tests assumed instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rate yield curves and commodity prices 
foreign exchange rates cummins is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of its international business presence 
the company transacts extensively in foreign currencies and has significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  corporate earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to benefit from global diversification and naturally offsetting currency positions  foreign exchange balance sheet exposures are aggregated and hedged at the corporate level primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
the objective of the hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings resulting from the translation of net foreign exchange balance sheet positions 
a uniform percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would decrease net earnings by approximately million for the year ending december  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on cummins competitive position  potential changes in sales levels and the offsetting impact on income of the revaluation of the underlying balance sheet exposures 
interest rates the company is also exposed to interest rate risk as result of its indebtedness 
the company s objectives in managing its exposure to changes in interests rates are to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall cost of borrowing funds 
to achieve its objectives  the company primarily uses interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to its borrowing arrangements 
a uniform percent increase in interest rates  which would remain fixed at the new  higher level for a one year period  would result in a decrease in net earnings of million 
this sensitivity analysis does not consider the change in the company s competitive environment indirectly related to changes in interest rates and management s response to these changes 
commodity prices the company is also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers 
given the historical volatility of commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
to reduce the effect of changing raw material prices for select commodities  cummins has entered into commodity swap agreements to hedge a portion of its anticipated raw material purchases on selected commodities 
a uniform percent increase in the price of commodities covered by commodity swap agreements  with prices then remaining fixed for a month period  would result in a decrease of net earnings of million
