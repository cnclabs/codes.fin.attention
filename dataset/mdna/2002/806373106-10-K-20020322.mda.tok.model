the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
the company s clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers  converters and advertising agencies  none of which individually represent more than of total revenue 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in the portfolio 
impairment of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company had made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles in effect through december   these assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives  and were tested periodically to determine if they were recoverable from operating earnings on an undiscounted basis over their useful lives 
effective in  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
other intangible assets that meet certain criteria will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and will also be subject to an impairment test based on estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is less than values based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of the statement is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately  per share per year 
during  the company will perform the first of the required impairment rests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  the company does not anticipate any adverse impact on the company earnings or financial position as a result of these tests 
impact of inflation the company believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure based on the company s variable rate debt outstanding at december   a change in interest rates would impact interest expense by approximately million 
assuming similar interest rates volatility in the future  a near term months change in interest rates would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
foreign exchange exposure the company has foreign operations that expose it to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to us dollars 
since changes in translation risk are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity  a change in the foreign exchange rate would not have material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
