item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with selected financial data and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview cysive  inc is a provider of multi channel enterprise software and services that allow companies to integrate web  wireless  voice activated systems  and web services across an enterprise 
historically  all of our revenue has resulted from the delivery of custom software and services solutions to our customers 
due to increasing competition  declining margins  and business volatility  in we began the transition of our business model from a software engineering services model to a software products and engineering services model 
accordingly  during we developed cysive cymbio tm  a software product that uses widely supported technologies and open standards to ensure seamless interoperability between multiple channels such as the web  wireless  voice  or web services  and databases or applications 
cysive cymbio s architecture reduces a customer s development time and costs and creates efficiencies by incorporating on a single code base all of the components required for developing applications that operate across multiple channels 
we introduced cysive cymbio in the fourth quarter of we believe companies are moving to a multi channel approach using web  wireless  voice activated systems  and web services to interact with their employees  customers  suppliers  partners and distributors 
technology advances  like cysive cymbio which incorporates our patent pending follow on tm technology  enable companies to implement multi channel solutions faster and more effectively across the enterprise 
in this environment  companies are exploring opportunities on a return on investment basis  and are pursuing projects that have the potential to create efficiencies within information technology investments previously made and to reduce costs 
since commencing operations in  we have used advanced internet technologies to build our customers software systems 
given our technology expertise  we target corporate customers who require highly complex systems to meet their growth strategies 
for example  our software engineers  in collaboration with cisco systems  inc cisco  built cisco s internetworking products center  or ipc  one of the world s largest internet commerce sites 
in addition to cisco  we have built advanced business systems for customers including chrysler corporation  equifax secure  inc  first union corporation  philips medical systems  na  schneider logistics  inc  tribune interactive  inc  and uunet technologies  inc 
we design software systems that can handle high volumes of customer transactions  operate reliably hours per day  seven days per week and expand to meet the growth requirements of large scale businesses that are broadening the methods they use to communicate and process information with internal and external users 
due to the advanced technologies necessary to complete our projects  we employ software engineers with an average of more than nine years of experience who use a well defined process to deliver reliable and secure custom systems on a timely basis 
prior to  we built large scale  distributed systems using approaches and technologies that are the foundations for current internet applications 
in late and early  our technology group evaluated and developed software prototypes using key internet technologies such as java  xml and corba 
after successfully deploying our first e business system in mid  we began to target customers who were making significant investments in their e business applications 
as a result  there was a fundamental shift in our business strategy away from general purpose distributed systems to customized e business applications 
as part of this strategy  in the fourth quarter of and the first half of  we spent considerable resources to accomplish two specific goals 
our first goal was to train all of our software engineers with advanced internet technologies that had been researched and prototyped by our technology group 
our second goal was to deploy a direct sales force capable of selling e business applications 
these initiatives significantly impacted our results of operations for these three quarters 
specifically  the generation of a sales pipeline of e business applications and the deployment of our sales force affected our revenues and sales and marketing expenses 
in addition  the completion of two of our largest distributed systems combined with the extensive training of our software engineers caused our utilization rates and gross margins to decline during these quarters 
these investments positioned us to become a leading e business engineering firm during the period from the third quarter of to the second quarter of in the second half of  we identified an emerging need for a technology solution as customers required an integrated solution for their web  wireless and voice activated systems 
as a result  we began focusing our non utilized software engineers on solving these complex development and integration issues 
we formed our product engineering group during  culminating in the release of our first product  cysive cymbio  in october we anticipate that this expansion of our business model will enable us to develop new opportunities  creating additional future revenue streams 
we currently derive principally all of our revenues from software engineering services that are provided primarily on a time and materials basis 
typically  revenues are recognized and billed monthly by multiplying the number of hours expended by our software engineers in the performance of the contract by the established billing rates 
our customers typically reimburse us for direct expenses allocated to a project such as airfare  lodging and meals 
consequently  these direct reimbursements are excluded from revenues 
with the introduction of cysive cymbio  we anticipate that future revenues will include a software licensing and maintenance component 
we further anticipate that revenues from cysive cymbio sales and related consulting services will be recognized using long term contract accounting principles due to the significant customization efforts required to build new applications using cysive cymbio as a platform base  and or to integrate cysive cymbio with legacy applications and data sources 
additionally  we expect that for the near future our migration to a software products and engineering services business model will result in significantly higher sales and marketing expense and research and development expense  expressed as a percentage of sales  than we have experienced in the past 
our gross margins may also be affected depending on the relative mix between product and service revenue 
the number of employees decreased from as of january  to as of december  the combination of a slow economy  declining demand for custom application development and the transition of our business model required us to undertake multiple restructurings during direct costs consist primarily of compensation and benefits for our software engineers and the non billable portion of other direct project costs 
allocated costs related to specific employees performing quality assurance reviews for customers are also included in direct costs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for our management  finance and administration  human resources  information technology  recruiting and the non billable portion of our quality assurance and regional management personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include depreciation and amortization and general operating expenses such as telephones  office supplies  travel  outside professional services and facilities costs 
research and development expenses include compensation and benefits for technical staff assigned to product engineering and related support and travel expenses 
to date  all research and development costs have been expensed 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  benefits  marketing programs and travel costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts 
we sell our services through a direct sales force organized by geographic region 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to build a direct sales force and expand our marketing programs 
restructuring expenses consist primarily of severance costs of salaries and benefits for a certain period of time for those employees identified in restructuring plans and facilities costs as approved by the board of directors in and stock compensation expense relates to grants of options during the years through to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price below the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and to the issuance of  shares of restricted stock to employees in the amount of deferred stock compensation included as a component of stockholders equity as of december  was million 
this balance will be amortized as follows projected gross stock year ended compensation expense in millions stock compensation expense in these years may be reduced by the impact of stock option cancellations

direct costs decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  direct costs increased to in from in this increase in direct costs as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues and a decrease in our average utilization rate in to from in our lower utilization rate in resulted primarily from a decrease in the demand for our services as noted above  without a proportional reduction in direct personnel 
direct costs also decreased due to a decrease in the number of billable software engineers 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million in from million in the gross margin decreased to in from in because  as noted above  our direct costs were not reduced in proportion to the decline in revenues 
additionally  there was a decline in the average billing rate per software engineer 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in support staff costs resulting from the lower overall employee headcount  bad debt expense  meetings and travel expenses  legal fees  recruiting costs  and office expense 
this decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of rent for facilities opened in the latter half of and the increase in depreciation expense

the expense in included the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the through stock option grants 
the decrease in stock compensation expense was due to cancellation of unvested options granted to employees who are no longer employed by us  the cancellation of certain restricted shares and the adjustment of the fair value of outstanding restricted shares as of december  operating loss 
operating loss increased million  or to a loss of million in from a loss of million in the operating loss margin increased to in from in investment income  net 
net investment income increased  to million in from million in primarily due to a higher average level of cash and investments in as compared with loss before taxes 
loss before taxes increased million to a loss of million in from a loss of million in this increase was primarily due to lower revenues generated in as a result of a general economic slowdown and declining demand for custom application development 
income tax expense 
we recorded  of income tax expense in as compared to a million net income tax expense in in  we provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset  creating a net income tax expense for the year because of the uncertainty of the realization of the deferred tax benefit 
in  we recorded income tax expense for the year as a result of a reduction in expected tax refunds from the use of loss carrybacks 
net loss 
net loss increased million to a loss of million in from a loss of million in this change is due primarily to lower revenues generated in as a result of a general economic slowdown partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and income tax expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase in revenues was due primarily to an increase in the number of software engineers  an increase in customers and an increase in our billable rates

direct costs also increased due to an increase in our wage rates 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in the gross margin decreased to in from in because our direct costs exceeded the rate of increase in revenue growth 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was due primarily to the addition and expansion of office space  an increase in legal fees related to our litigation support  an increase in bad debt expense  the inclusion of certain costs incurred as a publicly traded company  an increase in our recruiting and corporate administrative staffs and the addition of general infrastructure to support our increased headcount 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the expansion of our marketing and sales departments as well as an increase in variable compensation linked to the increase in sales and billing rates in additionally  we expanded our marketing programs directed at building brand recognition 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in from in restructuring 
we recorded million as restructuring in restructuring represented the amount of severance expense related to the lay off of certain non technical employees and real estate costs associated with the closing of some of our satellite offices 
as a percentage of revenues  restructuring was in stock compensation 
stock compensation expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the expense in was primarily related to a revaluation of our deemed fair market value in conjunction with our initial public offering in which certain options were fully vested and we recorded the stock compensation expense in full 
in addition  the expense included the amortization of the deferred stock compensation related to options granted between and at prices deemed below fair market value  which vest over a period of time

net loss 
net loss increased million to a loss of million in from a loss of million in this change is due primarily to the recording of a tax benefit in versus a tax expense and restructuring expense recorded in quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial data for the periods indicated 
we derived this data from our unaudited financial statements  and in our opinion  they include all adjustments  which consist only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary to present fairly the financial results for the periods 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future due to a number of factors including  but not limited to  changes in average billing rates  utilization rates and personnel additions or reductions  as well as the timing of expenses 
accordingly  our results for any given quarter or series of quarters are not necessarily indicative of our results for any future period 
however  our quarterly operating results may represent trends that aid in understanding our business

 as a percentage of revenues revenues gross margin operating expenses general and administrative research and development sales and marketing restructuring stock compensation operating margin loss income loss before taxes net margin loss revenues 
revenues increased from the quarter ended march  through the quarter ended june  primarily due to an increase in the number of active customers from to over the two quarters 
revenues decreased from the quarter ended june  through the quarter ended december  primarily due to a decrease in demand for our services as a result of a general economic slowdown and declining demand for custom application development beginning in the second half of the number of active customers decreased to in the quarter ended december  from in the quarter ended june  additionally  our average billing rate decreased over the seven quarters 
gross margin 
gross margin declined from to during the periods from march  through march   reflecting a decrease in utilization and fees over these five quarters 
our gross margin improved to in the second quarter of as a result of technical staff reductions while revenue only declined modestly from the prior quarter 
in the third quarter of gross margin dropped to as a result of a continuing decline in revenues 
in the fourth quarter of the gross margin increased to as a result of the benefit of additional technical staff reductions more than offsetting a further decline in revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were during the periods shown from march  through june   reflecting greater operating leverage as these expenditures were spread over a larger revenue base 
in the third and fourth quarters of  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased to and  respectively 
the increase in costs in the third and fourth quarter of was related to our increase in bad debt expense related to the write off of a bad account and other questionable receivables and an increase in recruiting costs and facility costs during these two quarters 
general and administrative costs decreased over the four quarters in this was primarily due to the restructuring plans in the fourth quarter of and in the first quarter of  and due to decreases in bad debt expense  legal fees  and meeting costs 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative costs increased to   and in the first  second  third and fourth quarter of  respectively  due to lower revenues generated in the four quarters 
research and development 
research and development costs relate to the salaries and other costs of our product engineering team who have been developing our product offerings 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue were generally in the range during the periods shown from march  through december  the first through third quarters of showed an increase in the sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues due to the decrease in revenue growth for those periods offset by a slight increase in the overall sales and marketing expense 
the significant increase in sales and marketing costs in the fourth quarter of was primarily due to an increase in marketing advertising and public relations expense related to branding initiatives and the launch of cysive cymbio in october of restructuring 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge related to the severance of non technical employees  the closing of satellite offices and the impairment of certain assets related to the offices 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a second restructuring charge related to the severance of technical  recruiting  sales and general and administrative personnel 
we recognized a net credit to restructuring in the third quarter of due to the reevaluation of the restructuring accrual after a decision not to close some satellite offices as originally intended 
the resulting credit was partially offset by a provision for severance related to the termination of technical employees in the quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional restructuring charge related to the severance of employees 
stock compensation 
stock compensation expense for all quarters presented includes the expense related to options granted at a value below fair market value 
the periods shown represent the straight line amortization of the deferred portion of the stock compensation expense 
the fourth quarter of includes compensation expense related to the granting of restricted stock for fourth quarter bonuses 
decreases in stock compensation expense are due to the reversal of previously amortized deferred stock expense for unvested options granted to employees who are no longer employed by us and cancellations of certain restricted stock shares and the adjustment of fair value of the outstanding restricted shares 
liquidity and capital resources on october   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock 
after deducting expenses  we received approximately million in proceeds from this transaction 
on october   we received an additional million in proceeds when the underwriters exercised their over allotment option for an additional  shares of our common stock 
on march   we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of our common stock 
after deducting expenses  we received approximately million in proceeds from this transaction 
in september  we renewed and renegotiated the terms on our line of credit with merrill lynch business financial services inc we are entitled to draw up to an amount equal to the lesser of million or eighty percent of our outstanding trade receivables less amounts greater than days past due 
at december   approximately  was available for borrowing 
we intend to use any borrowings under the line of credit for working capital purposes 
the interest rate on amounts borrowed under the line of credit is calculated using the day dealer commercial paper rate as quoted in the wall street journal  plus per annum 
the credit facility expires in september any borrowings under the line of credit will be secured by our trade receivables 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  investments  which reflect the application of our net proceeds from our public offerings  were million at december  net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  capital expenditures of million for the year ended december  were used primarily for computer equipment  office equipment and leasehold improvements related to the creation of a software development and demonstration laboratory 
through september   we operated as an s corporation 
accordingly  our stockholders included their pro rata share of our income in their personal income tax returns  and we were not subject to federal and most state income taxes during the periods prior to that time 
our stockholders elected to rescind the s corporation election effective on october  we paid million to our stockholders on december  as an s corporation distribution  and this distribution was funded through operating income 
we anticipate that the net proceeds from our public offerings  existing sources of liquidity and funds generated from operations  should be adequate to fund our currently anticipated cash needs through at least the next months 
to the extent we are unable to fund our operations from cash flows  we may need to obtain financing from external sources in the form of either additional equity or indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all  or that  if available  the financing will be obtainable on favorable terms 
in december  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock at the discretion of our executive officers 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of per share
