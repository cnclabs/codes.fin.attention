general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  great southern bank the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments  service charges and atm fees  commissions earned by non bank subsidiaries and other general operating income 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  postage  insurance  advertising  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
effect of federal laws and regulations federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and the bank  and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank 
potential impact of accounting principles to be implemented in the future the financial accounting standards board fasb recently adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations 
this statement establishes new standards for financial accounting and reporting for business combinations 
this statement eliminates the pooling of interests method and requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method 
the provisions of this statement apply to all business combinations initiated after june  and to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is july   or later 
initial adoption of sfas had no effect on the company s financial statements 
the fasb recently adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement establishes new financial accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the statement addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
it also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets including those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company expects to first apply sfas in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending december  initial adoption of sfas will have no effect on the company s financial statements 
the fasb recently adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement addresses how and when to measure impairment on long lived assets and how to account for long lived assets that an entity plans to dispose of either through sale  abandonment  exchange or distribution to owners 
the statement also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be recorded in the period in which the losses are incurred rather than at the measurement date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will first apply sfas in the first quarter of its year ending december  initial adoption of sfas will have no effect on the company s financial statements 
asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
since the company uses laddered brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund a portion of its loan growth  the company s assets tend to reprice more quickly than its liabilities 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is great southern s most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   great southern s internal interest rate risk models indicate a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is slightly positive 
interest rate risk exposure estimates the sensitivity gap are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the bank s interest rate risk 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends and the board of directors sets the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain our net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern 
in  the company began using interest rate swap derivatives to manage its interest rate risks from recorded financial liabilities 
these derivatives are utilized when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated asset or liability and such asset or liability exposes the company to interest rate risk 
beginning in  interest rate swaps are carried at fair value determined using quoted dealer prices and are recognized in the statement of financial condition in the prepaid expenses and other assets caption 
the company uses interest rate swaps to help manage its interest rate risks from recorded financial liabilities 
these instruments are utilized when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated liability and such liability exposes the company to interest rate risk 
amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swaps are accounted for on the accrual basis and recognized as interest income or expense of the related liability 
gains and losses on early termination of these instruments are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the yield on the related liability over the shorter of the remaining contract life or the maturity of the related asset or liability 
if the related liability is sold or otherwise liquidated  the instrument is marked to market  with the resultant gains and losses recognized in noninterest income 
fair values of interest rate swaps are estimated based on quoted dealer prices 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with the objective of hedging against the effects of changes in the fair value of its liabilities for fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit and trust preferred securities caused by changes in market interest rates 
the swap agreements generally provide for the company to pay a variable rate of interest based on a spread to the one month or three month london interbank offering rate libor and to receive a fixed rate of interest equal to that of the hedged instrument 
under the swap agreements the company is to pay or receive interest monthly  quarterly  semiannually or at maturity 
at december   the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was approximately  all consisting of swaps in a receivable position 
at december   the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was approximately  consisting of swaps in a receivable position of approximately  and swaps in a payable position of approximately  the maturities of interest rate swaps outstanding at december  and  in terms of notional amounts and their average pay and receive rates is discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following tables illustrate the expected maturities and repricing  respectively  of the bank s financial instruments at december  these schedules do not reflect the effects of possible prepayments or enforcement of due on sale clauses

net loans increased by million 
the main loan areas experiencing increases were commercial real estate  commercial construction  consumer and commercial business 
total investment securities increased by million  which was primarily an increase in available for sale united states government agency mortgage backed securities 
total liabilities increased million from december  to december   to billion 
deposits increased million  fhlbank advances increased million  short term borrowings increased million  and trust preferred securities increased million  partially offset by a decrease in the note payable to bank of million 
the increase in short term borrowings was the result of increases in securities sold under repurchase agreements and the utilization of federal funds purchased lines available from commercial banks 
management utilized these short term funding sources to take advantage of the falling interest rate environment throughout and better match the repricing characteristics of the company s assets 
the note payable to a third party bank was paid down to with the proceeds from the trust preferred securities issued in april this million line of credit remains in place to meet operating cash needs  and for use from time to time as a source of funds to repurchase shares of the company s stock 
during  the company issued trust preferred securities with net proceeds of million 
these securities qualify as tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
deposits increased million due primarily to an increase in certificates of deposit of million  of which million related to brokered deposits 
total brokered deposits were million at december  the weighted average cost of these deposits was approximately basis points higher than the retail certificate of deposit portfolio  excluding the effect of the company s interest rate swaps on a portion of these brokered certificates of deposit 
the interest rate swaps reduced the weighted average cost of the brokered certificate of deposit portfolio to a rate that is approximately basis points lower than the retail certificate of deposit portfolio 
checking accounts increased million  with an increase of million in non interest bearing accounts and an increase of million in interest bearing accounts 
there was a related decrease in savings balances of million due to the company s change of product offerings and the reclassification of certain account types 
management continues to feel that fhlbank advances and brokered deposits are viable alternatives to retail deposits when factoring in all the costs associated with the generation and maintenance of additional retail deposits 
stockholders equity increased million from million at december  to million at december  net income for fiscal year was million and accumulated other comprehensive income increased by million 
these items were offset by dividends of million and net treasury stock repurchases of million 
the company repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of per share during results of operations and comparison for the years ended december  and general the increase in earnings of million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million  or  and an increase in non interest income of million  or  partially offset by an increase in non interest expense of million  or  an increase in provision for loan losses of million  or  and an increase in provision for income taxes of million  or 
total interest income total interest income increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was due to a million  or  increase in interest income on investments and other interest earning assets  partially offset by a million  or  decrease in interest income on loans 
interest income for both loans and investment securities and other interest earning assets increased due to higher average balances  while interest on loans was negatively impacted by significantly lower average rates 
in addition  interest income in was higher due to the following items o interest income was positively impacted by recoveries of  and  of interest on two unrelated commercial real estate loans that were charged off in a prior year 
o interest income was positively impacted by a recovery of  of interest on a loan relationship that was removed from non performing status 
this million relationship is further discussed under provision for loan losses and was described in the december  annual report on form k 
o interest income was positively impacted by yield increases due to securities being purchased at a discount and being called at par value 
this resulted in an increase of approximately  interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to december   interest income on loans decreased from lower average interest rates  partially offset by higher average balances 
interest income decreased million as the result of lower average interest rates 
the average yield on loans decreased from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   as a result of decreases in market rates of interest  primarily the prime rate of interest 
a large portion of the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with changes to the prime rate of interest 
interest income increased million as the result of higher average loan balances from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the higher average balance resulted principally from the bank s increased commercial real estate and construction lending  commercial business lending and indirect dealer consumer lending 
the bank s one to four family residential loan portfolio has decreased since december   due to the origination of a greater dollar amount of fixed rate rather than adjustable rate loans 
the bank generally sells these fixed rate loans in the secondary market 
interest income investments and other interest earning deposits interest income on investments and other interest earning assets increased mainly as a result of higher average balances during the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  interest income increased million as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily in available for sale securities  where additional securities were acquired for liquidity and pledging to deposit accounts under repurchase agreements 
the increase in interest income was offset by  as a result of a decrease in average yields from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  total interest expense total interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on fhlbank advances of million  or  partially offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits of million  or  and an increase in interest expense on short term borrowings and trust preferred securities of million  or 
interest expense deposits interest expense on deposits increased million as a result of an increase in average balances of time deposits from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december   and decreased million due to a decrease in average interest rates on time deposits from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the average balances of time deposits increased primarily as a result of the company s use of brokered and other time deposits to fund loan and investment securities growth 
in recent years  brokered deposit rates have become competitive with rates on fhlbank advances and larger retail deposits 
the average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest in and the effects of the company s interest rate swaps 
interest on demand deposits decreased  due to a decrease in average rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   and increased  due to an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the other deposit category  savings  experienced a  decrease due primarily to a decrease in average balances 
the changes in average balances for demand deposits and savings deposits approximately offset each other and resulted from the company s change of product offerings and the reclassification of certain account types 
interest expense fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and trust preferred securities interest expense on fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and trust preferred securities decreased million due to a decrease in average rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  this was partially offset by an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december   resulting in increased interest expense of million due to higher average balances 
the average balance increase was used to fund growth in loans and investment securities 
average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates during the company s use of fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and trust preferred securities which reprice daily  monthly or quarterly contributed to the significant decrease in average rates of interest 
net interest income the company s overall interest rate spread increased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the increase was due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield received on interest earning assets 
the company s overall net interest margin decreased basis point  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans decreased basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased basis points 
the rate paid on deposits decreased basis points  while the rate paid on fhlbank advances and other borrowings decreased basis points 
the prime rate of interest averaged during the year ended december   compared to an average of during the year ended december  as a large percentage of the bank s loans are tied to prime  this decrease was the primary reason for the decrease in the weighted average yield received on interest earning assets 
interest rates paid on deposits  fhlbank advances and other borrowings decreased significantly during compared to as market rates of interest declined during  the company reduced rates paid to depositors 
in addition in  the company utilized interest rate swaps and fhlbank advances which repriced daily  monthly or quarterly to reduce interest expense 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased million  or  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
non performing assets decreased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  non performing loans decreased million  or  from million at december   to million at december   and foreclosed assets increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  commercial loans comprise million  or  of the total million non performing loans at december  three unrelated commercial real estate credit relationships  totaling million  million and million  respectively  account for a majority of this non performing total 
the million relationship is secured by a motel  condominium units and vacant land in the branson  missouri area 
this relationship was placed in a non accrual status in the fourth quarter of the million relationship is secured primarily by condominium buildings and lots  single family residences and lots  and other developed land near the lake of the ozarks  missouri 
this credit is part of the million relationship described in the annual report on form k 
the million relationship is secured by the real estate and business assets of a restaurant in branson  missouri 
a portion of this credit is guaranteed by the small business administration 
this relationship was placed in a non accrual status in the fourth quarter of of the total million of foreclosed assets at december   three relationships account for million 
the first relationship involves a planned golf course and undeveloped lots near the lake of the ozarks  missouri 
the golf course is not operating and is listed for sale with a broker 
the second relationship involves a single family residence located near springfield  missouri 
the property is listed for sale with a broker 
the third relationship involves a single family residence located in springfield  missouri 
the house was under construction at the time of foreclosure and is now near completion 
potential problem loans increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  these are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems which may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current loan repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in the non performing loans 
potential problem loans increased primarily as a result of one large commercial real estate credit relationship  totaling million  which was removed from non performing status  although this relationship remains on the problem asset watch list currently 
this relationship was described in the december  annual report on form k and is secured by a golf course  condominium buildings and lots  single family residences and lots  and other developed and undeveloped land 
the loan relationship has been strengthened through a participation in this credit with another financial institution  which resulted in additional collateral being provided for the loan 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on current economic conditions 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional assets would be classified as non performing  and accordingly  additional provision for losses would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition 
non interest income non interest income increased million  or  in the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to i an increase in service charges and atm fees of million  or  ii an increase in net realized gains on sales of fixed rate residential and other loans of million  or  and iii an increase of  in profits on sales of available for sale investment securities 
the increase in service charge income resulted from new products introduced  increased activity and a larger number of deposit accounts 
the increase in atm fees is related to an increase in overall usage by customers and non customers 
during the year ended december   the bank sold significantly more residential and student loans than in during  interest rates were conducive to the generation of fixed rate mortgages  which the bank typically sells  rather than adjustable rate mortgages  which the bank typically retains in its portfolio 
during the year ended december   the company sold some of its investments in debt securities to restructure its portfolio and realized the resulting gains and losses 
this increase was partially offset by i a decrease in commissions revenues of million  or  and ii expenses on foreclosed assets of  in versus gains on foreclosed assets of  in in  the company incurred expenses to prepare properties for sale  primarily related to two properties 
both the travel and investment subsidiaries have experienced decreased sales activity as a result of general economic conditions prevailing in the investment subsidiary has been adversely affected by declining activity by investors in the u 
s 
stock markets 
the travel subsidiary has been adversely affected by the merger of american airlines and trans world airlines twa 
special incentives negotiated between the travel subsidiary and twa were discontinued in as a result of the merger 
in addition  the terrorist attacks on september   caused the cancellation of many travel activities  resulting in commission refunds by the travel subsidiary 
due to the current instability in the travel industry  the travel subsidiary likely will continue to generate little net income 
non interest expense non interest expense increased million  or  in the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to i an increase of million  or  in salaries and employee benefits  and ii an increase of  or  in net occupancy and equipment expense due primarily to renovation work and the related depreciation at the company s main office and operations center and other branch locations 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits primarily relates to normal merit increases for existing employees and the hiring of additional experienced personnel to fill key supervisory and customer sales positions 
this was partially offset by smaller increases and decreases in other expense categories 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income decreased slightly from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  this decrease primarily relates to the company s increase in average balances in tax exempt investments
