overview general king continued its record of sustained revenue and earnings growth  along with several milestone events during these events include the fda s approval of new drug applications for levoxyl r and tigan r  the acquisition of licenses related to the potential commercialization of estrasorb tm and androsorb tm  the submission of the new drug application for estrasorb tm  the acquisition of three branded products and a license to a fourth from bristol myers squibb  and the equity and convertible debenture offerings through which we raised approximately billion 
approval of new drug applications our new drug application for levoxyl r was approved by the fda on may  levoxyl r is a synthetic hormone used for the treatment of hypothyroidism and suppression of thyroid stimulating hormone 
the new drug application for levoxyl r was submitted to the fda pursuant to the fda s august   notice in the federal register that orally administered levothyroxine sodium drug products are new drugs 
the fda notice required that manufacturers of such drugs who wish to continue to market these products must submit applications as required by the fdc act by august  on april   the fda issued a second federal register notice extending the deadline for filing these applications until august  with approval of our new drug application  levoxyl r is the number one prescribed fda approved levothyroxine sodium product in the united states 
the fda is requiring unapproved levothyroxine sodium products that have had new drug applications pending since on or before august  to be gradually phased out of distribution by august  also  the fda has suggested that healthcare providers begin transitioning patients from non approved levothyroxine sodium products to fda approved products such as levoxyl r 
as the number one prescribed fda approved levothyroxine sodium product in the united states  we believe levoxyl r is well positioned to continue to gain market share 
also  we have filed with the us patent and trademark office applications for in excess of patents on levoxyl r 
if granted  these patents should support the long term viability of the product 
we believe these factors enhance the future growth potential of levoxyl r 
on december   we received approval from the fda for our new drug application for tigan r mg capsules 
tigan r is indicated for the treatment of post operative nausea and vomiting and for nausea associated with gastroenteritis 
we began distributing and marketing tigan r mg capsules in february as the only trimethobenzamide hydrochloride capsule proven safe and effective  we are working diligently to protect the long term growth potential of tigan r mg capsules 
specifically  we have filed with the us patent and trademark office applications for patents covering our new tigan r technology  including our fda approved tigan r mg capsules 
the pending patent applications are drawn to  among other things  formulations  dosages  dosage forms  biopharmaceutical characteristics  methods of production  methods of use and methods of instruction 
if the applications are granted  the resulting patents will potentially provide us with patent protection for our fda approved tigan r mg capsules for years from the filing date of the applications 
estrasorb tm and androsorb tm licenses we acquired an exclusive worldwide license from novavax to promote  market  distribute and sell estrasorb tm  except in the united states and puerto rico where the parties will co market the product  following approval 
estrasorb tm is a topical estrogen replacement therapy which employs novavax s proprietary micellar nanoparticle technology designed to deliver beta estradiol  a naturally occurring hormone  through the skin when applied topically in the form of a lotion 
once approved  we will pay novavax a royalty based on a percentage of net sales of estrasorb tm outside of the united states and puerto rico 
novavax will pay king a co promotion fee equal to of net sales less cost of goods of estrasorb tm within the united states and puerto rico 
marketing expenses for estrasorb tm in the united states and puerto rico  following approval  will be shared equally by the parties 
on june   novavax submitted a new drug application for estrasorb tm to the fda 
the fda has accepted the new drug application for review

novavax will pay king a co promotion fee equal to of net sales less cost of goods of androsorb tm within the united states and puerto rico 
androsorb tm is currently in phase ii of its development

equity and convertible debenture offerings during november  we completed the sale of  newly issued shares of common stock for per share  raising a total of approximately million 
additionally  during november  we issued million of convertible debentures due november  in a private placement 
in february  the convertible debentures were registered with the securities and exchange commission 
on december   we completed a tender offer to retire approximately million in principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due with over million in cash and cash equivalents  we believe king is well positioned for the continued successful execution of our growth strategies in the following summarizes net revenues by operating segment in thousands 
for the years ended december  branded pharmaceuticals    royalties    contract manufacturing    other    total    results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total net revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in  due primarily to the growth and acquisition of branded pharmaceutical products 
net sales from branded pharmaceutical products increased million  or  to million in from million in the continued strong growth in net sales of altace r and levoxyl r  together with the acquisitions of nordette r and bicillin r from wyeth in july  and the acquisition of corzide r  delestrogen r and florinef r and a license to corgard r from bristol myers squibb in august  accounted for the majority of the increase in net sales of our branded pharmaceutical products 
while we expect continued growth in net sales of our branded pharmaceuticals  we refer you to the risk factors that appear elsewhere in this report  particularly those related to altace r and levoxyl r  that could cause results to materially differ 
revenue from royalties is derived from payments we receive based on sales of adenoscan r and adenocard r 
revenues from royalties increased million  or  to million in from million in revenues from contract manufacturing decreased million  or  to million in from million in the majority of the decrease was due to the expiration in october of a distribution agreement pursuant to which jones previously supplied thrombogen r  a line of thrombin based products  to ethicon  inc  a subsidiary of johnson and johnson products  inc 
sales of our branded pharmaceutical product  thrombin jmi r  benefited from the expiration of the distribution agreement 
although contract manufacturing is not a focus of our growth strategies  we expect net sales from contract manufacturing to increase in net sales from generic and other sources decreased million  or  to million in from million in primarily due to decreased sales of a private label generic product line to another pharmaceutical company 
gross profit total gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in total gross profit  excluding special charges  increased million  or to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased gross profit from branded pharmaceutical products 
gross profit was impacted by some special charges in and as follows we incurred a non recurring write off of inventory in the amount of million during the fourth quarter related to our voluntary recall of products manufactured for us by dsm pharmaceuticals as a result of regulatory issues related to dsm s manufacturing facility in greenville  north carolina 
dsm has notified us that it has addressed the relevant compliance issues and resumed production of our products 
we have resumed distribution of some of the affected products during the first quarter of and we expect to resume distribution of the remaining affected products during the first half of during the third quarter of  we incurred a nonrecurring write off of obsolete levoxyl r inventory of million 
the fda approved the new drug application for a new formulation of levoxyl r on may  pursuant to fda guidance  we may distribute only the fda approved new formulation of levoxyl r after august  during the third quarter of  we recorded a nonrecurring write off of inventory of million associated with our decision to discontinue fluogen r  an influenza virus vaccine 
gross profit from branded pharmaceutical products increased million  or  to million in from million in gross profit from branded pharmaceutical products  excluding the special charges described above  increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increases in gross profit from the altace r and levoxyl r product lines as well as additional gross profit arising from the acquisition of nordette r and bicillin r from wyeth in july  and the acquisition of corzide r  delestrogen r and florinef r and a license to corgard r from bristol myers squibb in august while we expect continued growth in gross profit from our branded pharmaceuticals  we refer you to the risk factors that appear elsewhere in this report  particularly those related to altace r and levoxyl r  that could cause results to materially differ 
gross profit from royalties increased million  or  to million in from million in while we believe gross profit from royalties will continue to grow  we refer you to the risk factors that appear elsewhere in this report that could cause results to materially differ 
gross profit associated with contract manufacturing decreased million  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the expiration in october of a distribution agreement pursuant to which jones previously supplied thrombogen r  a line of thrombin based products  to ethicon  inc  a subsidiary of johnson and johnson products  inc sales of our branded pharmaceutical product  thrombin jmi r  benefited from the expiration of the distribution agreement 
we believe the gross loss associated with contract manufacturing may decrease during in comparison to the gross profit from generic and other products decreased million  or  to million in from million in primarily due to decreased sales of a private label generic product line to another pharmaceutical company 
operating costs and expenses total operating costs and expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased fees and expenses associated with the promotion of altace r under the co promotion agreement with wyeth  offset by a million reduction in merger  restructuring  and other nonrecurring charges 
fees and expenses associated with the promotion of altace r under the co promotion agreement will continue to increase based on anticipated growth in net sales of altace r 
therefore  we believe that total operating costs and expenses will continue to increase 
cost of revenues  increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to costs associated with increased unit sales of our branded pharmaceutical products  including altace r and levoxyl r  the acquisition of nordette r and bicillin r from wyeth in july  and the acquisition of corzide r  delestrogen r and florinef r and a license to corgard r from bristol myers squibb in august  partially offset by a reduction in special charges related to the write off of product inventory in as compared to as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues decreased to in from in due to an increase in sales of higher margin products and higher special charges related to the write off of product inventory in compared to we have royalty expense obligations that arise in connection with our sales of brevital r and tapazole r and sales of adenoscan r and adenocard r generated by our licensees 
royalty expense increased million  or to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to fees and expenses associated with the promotion of altace r under the co promotion agreement with wyeth and the growth of our dedicated national field sales force from approximately to representatives during fees and expenses associated with the promotion of altace r under the co promotion agreement will continue to increase based on anticipated growth in net sales of altace r 
therefore  we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase based in part on the anticipated growth in net sales of altace r 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of the intangible assets related to the acquisitions of nordette r and bicillin r from wyeth in july  and the acquisition of corzide r  delestrogen r and florinef r and a license to corgard r from bristol myers squibb in august research and development expenses  including the special license rights  increased million to million in from million in we continue to increase our commitment to research and development 
therefore  we believe research and development expense will continue to increase at a comparable rate

operating income operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in excluding special charges  operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in due to higher special charges in compared to this increase was primarily due to increased revenues from altace r and levoxyl r  plus the acquisition of nordette r and bicillin r from wyeth in july  and the acquisition of corzide r  delestrogen r and florinef r and a license to corgard r from bristol myers squibb in august as a percentage of net revenues  operating income increased to in from in due to a reduction in the amount of special charges 
excluding special charges  operating income decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in due primarily to the fees and expenses associated with the promotion of altace r under the co promotion agreement with wyeth 
while we believe operating income in will continue to grow due to increased net sales of our branded pharmaceutical products  we refer you to the risk factors that appear elsewhere in this report  particularly those related to branded pharmaceutical products such as altace r and levoxyl r that could cause results to materially differ 
other income expense interest income decreased million  or to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower average investments and reduced rates of return on investments in interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in  due to a significant reduction in average borrowings outstanding

during  other income was due primarily to the gain realized on an interest rate swap 
income tax expense the effective tax rate in of and of was higher than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to permanent differences related to certain nondeductible merger related costs in as well as state income taxes in both and we anticipate a similar tax rate in as that experienced in income before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle due to the factors set forth above  income before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased million  or  to million in from million in income before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  excluding nonrecurring charges  increased million  or to million in from million in extraordinary items during the year ended december   we recognized an extraordinary loss of million million net of income taxes due to the write off of unamortized financing costs and premiums paid resulting from the repayment of debt during this period

the effect of the change on the year ended december  was to decrease revenue by million and decrease net income by million  or 
per share on a diluted basis

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
will be utilized on all business combinations of king after july  therefore  pooling of interest transactions  such as our prior acquisitions of medco and jones  will no longer be permitted 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
modifies the accounting and reporting for acquired intangible assets at the time of acquisition and in subsequent periods 
intangible assets which have finite lives must be amortized over their estimated useful life 
intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized but evaluated annually for impairment 
any impairment loss determined upon adoption of sfas no 
is to be treated as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
goodwill will not be amortized but instead tested for impairment annually 
sfas no 
was effective immediately for goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  and is effective beginning in for all previously acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
we have applied the provisions of sfas no 
for the acquisitions of intangible assets in the third quarter of related to the corgard r  corzide r  delestrogen r and florinef r products 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we are in the process of a assessing the useful lives of our intangible assets  including whether any would have indefinite lives  b determining whether a transitional impairment charge will be required as of january  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  and c determining whether reclassification of certain intangible assets as goodwill and vice versa is necessary 
although we have not completed our assessment of the impact of implementing sfas no 
 we are not expecting such implementation to have a material impact on future results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of reviewing the impact of these pronouncements 
critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside professional advisors to assist in our evaluation 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical because they involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our trade customers to make required payments 
we provide an allowance for specific customer accounts where collection is doubtful and also provide a general allowance for other accounts based on historical collection and write off experience 
judgment is necessary and if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we evaluate all of our inventory for short dated or slow moving product based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
for those units in inventory that are so identified  we estimate their market value or net sales value based on current realization trends 
if the projected net realizable value is less than cost  on a product basis  we provide a provision to reflect the lower value of that inventory 
this methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold 
intangible assets 
when we purchase products we classify the purchase price  including expenses and assumed liabilities  as intangible assets 
the purchase price is allocated to product rights  trademarks  patents and other intangibles using the assistance of valuation experts 
we estimate the useful lives of the assets by factoring in the characteristics of the products such as patent protection  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other issues 
the factors that drive the estimate of the life of the asset are inherently uncertain 
long lived assets 
we review our property and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows and  in some cases  the current fair value of the asset 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
accruals for rebates  returns  and chargebacks 
accrued rebates are estimated based on a percentage of selling price determined from historical information 
returns are accrued based on historical experience equal to the cost of replacement product in accordance with our return policy 
chargebacks are based on the estimated days of unprocessed claims using historical experience 
in all cases  judgment is required in estimating these reserves and actual claims for rebates  returns and chargebacks could be different from the estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when the risks and rewards of ownership are assumed by the buyer 
this generally occurs upon delivery of product to the buyer
