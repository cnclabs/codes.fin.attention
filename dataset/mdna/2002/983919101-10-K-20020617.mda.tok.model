item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement the statements in this management s discussion and analysis that are forward looking involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations 
the reader should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those risks discussed under factors affecting future operating results and elsewhere in this document 
forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking words  such as may  will  could  should  expect  believe  anticipate  estimate  continue  plan  intend  project  or other similar words 
nature of operations xilinx designs  develops and markets complete programmable logic solutions  including advanced ics  software design tools  predefined system functions delivered as ip cores  design services  customer training  field engineering and technical support 
our plds include fpgas and cplds 
these devices are standard products that our customers program to perform desired logic operations 
our products are designed to provide high integration and quick time to market for electronic equipment manufacturers primarily in the telecommunications  networking  computing  industrial  and consumer markets 
we market our products throughout the world through a direct sales management organization  direct sales to oems by independent sales representative firms  and sales through several franchised domestic and foreign distributors 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include valuation of financial instruments  which impacts gains losses on equity securities when we record impairments  revenue recognition  which impacts the recording of revenues  valuation of inventories  which impacts cost of revenues and gross margin  and the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill and other intangibles 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other key accounting policies that either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
valuation of financial instruments the company s short term and long term investments include investments in marketable equity and debt securities 
the company also has an equity investment in umc  a public semiconductor wafer manufacturing company  of million at march  in determining if and when a decline in market value below cost of these investments is other than temporary  as required by sfas  the company evaluates the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples  and other key measures for our investments in marketable equity securities and debt instruments 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  the company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
due to the slowdown in the semiconductor industry and economic recession in fiscal and  the market value of the company s umc investment declined significantly 
these declines were deemed to be other than temporary and losses of million and million  respectively  were recognized 
if the slowdown in the semiconductor industry continues in fiscal or beyond  the company may recognize additional losses on these investments 
revenue recognition sales to distributors are made under agreements providing price protection and rights of return under certain circumstances 
revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to customers or electronic manufacturing service companies which are used by many of our key oems 
accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally transfers upon shipment at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms 

table of contents revenue from sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
for each of the periods presented  there were no formal acceptance provisions with our end customers 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of shipment 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined using the first in  first out method  or market 
given the cyclicality of the market and the obsolescence of technology and shorter product life cycles  the company writes down inventories to net realizable value based on backlog and forecasted demand 
however  backlog is subject to revisions  cancellations  and rescheduling 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such difference may have a material effect on the company s gross margins 
the company s standard cost revision policy is to continuously review and monitor our standard costs based on current manufacturing costs 
the company s excess and obsolescence reserve policy is generally to reserve inventory in excess of nine months of forecasted demand 
during fiscal and  we had significant write downs of inventory due to a sharp decrease in backlog and forecasted demand due to a worldwide economic slowdown as well as a significant standards revision resulting from lower manufacturing costs 
the company s reserve policy on new products is to reserve all inventory at standard cost until the devices are production released 
long lived assets including goodwill we will adopt financial accounting standards board fasb statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on march  accordingly  we will no longer amortize goodwill from acquisitions  but will continue to amortize other acquisition related intangibles 
consequently  we expect amortization of intangibles to be approximately million for fiscal  down from million of amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles in fiscal in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill  effective march   the first day of the company s new fiscal year  we completed a goodwill impairment review for the rocketchips acquisition  which represents the company s only goodwill  and found no impairment 
at march   the unamortized balance of goodwill was million 
according to our accounting policy under the new rules  we will perform a similar review annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses our estimates of future market share and revenues and costs for these groups as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
if we fail to deliver new products  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the telecommunications businesses fail to improve  our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of certain long lived assets and acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas requires recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets in the event that the carrying value of such assets exceeds the fair values 
when we have indicators of impairment  we review our long lived assets and acquired intangible assets for impairment based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets 
impairment evaluations require management estimates in the forecast of future operating results that are used in the preparation of expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future cash flows and remaining economic lives could differ from management s estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
this could require additional impairment charges 
in august  the fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
we will adopt this standard beginning march  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents results of operations net revenues in thousands change change net revenues we classify our product offerings into four categories by semiconductor manufacturing process technology advanced products  mainstream products  base products and support products 
these four product categories are adjusted on a regular basis to accommodate advances in our process technology 
the most recent adjustment was on april  advanced products include our newest technologies manufactured on micron and smaller process technologies  which include the spartan ii  spartan iie  virtex e  virtex ii  virtex ii pro  and coolrunner ii product lines 
mainstream products are currently manufactured on to micron process technologies and include the virtex  xcxl  xcxla  xcxv  xcxl  spartanxl and coolrunner product lines 
base products consist of our mature product families that are currently manufactured on process technologies of micron and larger  this includes the xc  xc  xc  xc  xc  xce  xcex and spartan families 
our support products make up the remainder of our product offerings and include configuration solutions serial proms  software  ip cores  design services and support 
xilinx s net revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to an industry wide recession 
the increase in fiscal over was primarily due to the significant growth in spartan and virtex product lines and in general a very strong semiconductor industry 
net revenue growth slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to decelerating bookings and order cancellations resulting from a softening economy and increased inventory levels experienced at a broad base of our customers  particularly in the telecommunications sector 
advanced products represented and of total net revenues in fiscal and the percentage increase in revenues of advanced products was due to the introduction and strong market acceptance of virtex ii and spartan ii products across a broad base of sectors 
mainstream and base products represented of total net revenues in fiscal and in fiscal mainstream and base products saw the largest revenue decline in the virtex  xl and xla product families due to the combination of weak demand  excess inventories at end customers  and customer migration to newer product offerings 
support products represented and of total net revenues in fiscal and  respectively  with the vast majority of the revenue being configuration solutions serial proms with the remainder coming from software  ip cores  design services and support 
no end customer accounted for more than of revenues in fiscal  or net revenues by technology for the years ended march   and were as follows in millions advanced products mainstream products base products support products total net revenues in order to compete effectively  we pass manufacturing cost reductions on to our customers in the form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins 
price erosion is common in the semiconductor industry  as advances in both product architecture and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost 
we have historically been able to offset much of the revenue decline of our mature technologies with increased revenues from newer technologies  although no assurance can be given that we can continue to do so in the future 

table of contents net revenues by geography for the years ended march    and were as follows in millions north america europe japan asia pacific rest of world total net revenues international revenues represented approximately   and of total net revenues for fiscal years   and  respectively 
europe  japan  and asia pacific rest of world all experienced revenue decreases in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the industry wide global recession that particularly affected the telecommunications sector 
gross margin in thousands change change gross margin percentage of net revenues the significant decrease in gross margin percentages in fiscal compared to resulted from a write down of inventories during the second quarter of fiscal and from product mix shifts away from mainstream and base products that generate higher margins 
the inventory write down related primarily to the virtex and virtex e product families and was based on a sharp decrease in backlog and forecasted demand due to a worldwide economic slowdown as well as a significant standards revision resulting from lower manufacturing costs 
advanced products represented of total net revenues in fiscal  while they were only in fiscal as the demand for our products shifts away from the older  more profitable product families  gross margin could come under further pressure 
margins for the advanced products virtex e  virtex ii product families as well as spartan ii products are below our more mature base and mainstream product families  as the products have not yet achieved optimal manufacturing volumes  costs and yields 
during fiscal  our gross margin percentage decreased from the prior year primarily due to the write down for inventory in excess of the demand and backlog due to a slowdown in business during the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the gross margin percentage decreased in fiscal from the prior year due to lower margin new products such as spartan ii and virtex e and the decline in revenue of our older more profitable product families 
research and development in thousands change change research and development percentage of net revenues research and development expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
research and development expenses for fiscal and include non cash deferred stock compensation of million and million  respectively  associated with the november acquisition of rocketchips see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding rocketchips deferred stock compensation  research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses from fiscal to was related to reduction of some projects  reduction in outside services  and employee related expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses from fiscal to was related to designing new complex and high density devices  development of advanced process technologies  increased labor related costs associated with the development of new products along with increased labor costs associated with the acquisition of rocketchips 
we remain committed to a significant level of research and development effort in order to extend our technology leadership in the programmable logic marketplace 
through march   we held issued us patents and we maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of  but not limited to  software  ic architecture  system design  testing methodologies  and other technologies relating to plds 

table of contents sales  general and administrative in thousands change change sales  general and administrative percentage of net revenues sales  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues in fiscal and million  or of net revenues in fiscal the decrease in sales  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily attributable to lower commissions and marketing expenses as well as a reduction in employee related expenses such as salaries  staff development and travel 
the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased personnel and facilities expenses  increased advertising and promotional expenditures  increased outside sales commissions and sales incentives on higher revenues and legal expenses 
we remain committed to controlling our sales  general and administrative expenses 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of goodwill and other intangibles of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  relates to the november acquisition of rocketchips 
an additional million  million and million of intangibles amortization related to other technology acquisitions is included in cost of revenues and million  million and million is included in research and development expenses for  and  respectively 
remaining goodwill and acquired intangibles continued to be amortized through fiscal year using an estimated useful life of four to seven years 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  effective for business combinations initiated after june   and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  beginning in fiscal  goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will instead be subject to periodic impairment tests 
impairment loss on intangible assets and equipment we evaluate the carrying value of certain long lived assets and acquired intangibles  consisting primarily of testing equipment  goodwill  acquired technology  patents  and other intangible assets  recorded on the balance sheet  in accordance with sfas on a quarterly basis 
sfas requires recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets in the event that the carrying values of such assets exceed the fair values 
when we have indicators of impairment  we review our long lived assets and acquired intangible assets for impairment based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets 
we recognized an impairment loss on intangible assets and equipment of million during the second quarter of fiscal consisting of the following items 
due to the significant economic downturn in the pld market  we recorded impairment charges of million relating to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with a number of technology acquisitions completed during the past two years 
in conjunction with a decline in demand and migration to new test platforms  we also recorded an impairment loss of million for the write down of excess testers that were acquired in anticipation of higher unit growth 
the discount rate applied to these cash flows was based on the weighted average cost of capital  using comparable guideline companies 
due to the fact that the carrying amount of these assets will not be recoverable  these charges were taken in accordance with sfas write off of acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of rocketchips in fiscal  approximately million of in process research and development costs were written off 
in fiscal  in connection with the acquisition of philips semiconductors line of low power cplds  approximately million was written off for the research and development project in process 
the projects identified as in process would have required additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility 
these projects had identifiable technological risk factors that indicated that even though successful completion was expected  it was not assured 
if an identified project is not successfully completed there is no alternative future use for the project and the expected future income will not be realized 
the 
table of contents acquired in process research and development represented the appraised value of technologies in the development stage that had not yet reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses 
to determine the value of the in process research and development  the expected future cash flow attributable to the in process technology was discounted  taking into account the percentage of completion  utilization of pre existing core technology  risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets  and technological risk associated with completing the development of the technology 
we expensed these non recurring charges in the period of acquisition

capital gain from merger of usic with umc in january  united silicon inc usic was merged into united microelectronics corp umc and our equity position in usic was converted into shares of umc which are publicly traded on the taiwan stock exchange 
we recognized a non cash gain of million million net of taxes in fiscal as a result of the merger 
the gain represented the appreciation of our investment in usic 
as a result of this merger  we received approximately million umc shares  which represent approximately of the combined umc group 
in july  we received a stock dividend that increased our investment holdings in umc to approximately million shares 
in july  we received a stock dividend that increased our investment holdings to approximately million shares 
we retain equivalent wafer capacity rights in umc as we previously had in usic  as long as we retain a certain percentage of our original umc shares 
if our holdings fall below that percentage  our wafer capacity rights would be prorated by the umc shares we hold 
due to restrictions imposed by umc and the taiwan stock exchange  the majority of our umc shares could not be sold until july these regulatory restrictions will gradually expire between july and january umc investment valuation due to the weakness in the semiconductor industry  the value of our umc shares declined to million as of march  the downturn in the semiconductor industry and the economy in general  was more severe than previously anticipated  and there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding when the semiconductor industry will recover from this down cycle 
because of the continued downturn in the economy  we believed that the decline in the market value of our investment in umc as of march   was other than temporary as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognized a pre tax write down of million million net of tax 
the value of our umc shares declined to million as of september  because of the continued downturn in the economy  we believed that the decline in the market value of our investment in umc as of september  was other than temporary 
during the second quarter of fiscal we recognized a pre tax write down of million million net of tax to reflect this other than temporary decline in market value 
the value of our unrestricted umc shares increased in value by million during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  increasing the total value of our umc investment to million as of march  under the provisions of sfas  we increased the value of the umc investment by million  recognized deferred tax liabilities of million and increased accumulated other comprehensive income by million 
we will continue to re evaluate the umc investment quarterly to determine whether there are incremental other than temporary impairments 
temporary decreases or increases in the value of the umc unrestricted investment  if any  will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  in future periods  we may recognize a gain or loss if we sell our umc shares due to fluctuations in the market value of umc stock 
altera corporation lawsuit settlement on july   the company settled all of its outstanding patent litigation with altera  under which altera paid the company million and both parties exchanged limited patent licenses and executed agreements not to sue under any patent for at least five years 
during the second quarter of fiscal we recorded a lawsuit settlement of million  net of settlement costs of million 
interest income and other  net in thousands change change interest income and other  net percentage of net revenues 
table of contents interest income and other  net was million  or of net revenues in fiscal compared to million  or of net revenues in fiscal and million  or of net revenues in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to was primarily due to lower interest rates in fiscal as compared to the amount of interest income and other  net in the future will continue to be impacted by the level of our average cash and investment balances  prevailing interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates 
for fiscal  interest income and other  net included a pre tax gain on one of our investments of million due to acquisition by a public company 
excluding this gain  net interest and other income was million  or of sales 
excluding this gain  the dollar increase from fiscal year to was primarily due to an increase in the interest income related to higher interest rates offset by foreign exchange losses due to the weaker japanese yen in fiscal compared to fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes in thousands change change provision for benefit from taxes on income n a effective tax rate the effective tax rates for fiscal years   and were  and respectively 
the effective tax rates in all years reflect the impact of foreign income loss at different rates and tax credits earned in the us fiscal years and were also impacted by non deductible acquisition related amortization 
the company filed a petition with the us tax court on march  in response to assertions by the internal revenue service that the company owed additional tax for fiscal years through the company is in discussions with the appeals office of the internal revenue service to resolve and settle the issues 
two issues have been settled with the appeals office and we are exploring possibilities for settlement of additional issues 
one of the unresolved issues relates to whether the value of compensatory stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with xilinx ireland 
the company filed a motion for summary judgment in february and the internal revenue service filed a cross motion for summary judgment in march it is premature to comment further on the likely outcome of any issues that have not been settled to date 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments and sufficient taxes have been provided 
joint venture equity converted to umc shares we recorded our proportional ownership of the net income loss of usic  a wafer fabrication joint venture located in taiwan  as joint venture equity income loss prior to the merger of usic and umc 
in fiscal  income was generated as usic began to realize volume wafer production and shipments 
as a result of the conversion of our equity position in usic to shares of umc in january  as discussed above  we no longer record joint venture equity income 
inflation to date  the effects of inflation on our financial results have not been significant 
we cannot assure  however  that inflation will not affect us materially in the future 

table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we have used a combination of cash flow from operations and equity financing to support ongoing business activities  acquire critical technologies and make investments in complementary technologies  purchase facilities and capital equipment  purchase securities  repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program and finance inventory and accounts receivable 
additionally  our investment in umc is available for future sale  subject to restrictions 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during fiscal  we generated cash flow of million from operating activities and used million in investing activities and million in financing activities 
investing activities during fiscal included million of net purchases of investments and million of expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
financing activities during fiscal included an increase of million from issuance of common stock and sales of put options  offset by million of stock buyback 
during fiscal  we generated cash flow of million from operating activities  million from investing activities  and consumed million in financing activities 
investing activities during fiscal included million of net proceeds from sales and purchases of investments  million cash obtained from acquisition of rocketchips  offset by million of expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
financing activities during fiscal included an increase of million from issuance of common stock and sales of put options  offset by million of stock buyback 
receivables receivables decreased from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the decreased level of revenue 
inventories inventories decreased from million at march to million at march due to the decreased level of revenue and corresponding minimal purchases of inventory 
in fiscal  we wrote down inventories due to a sharp decrease in backlog and forecasted demand due to a worldwide economic slowdown as well as a significant standards revision resulting from lower manufacturing costs 
given the cyclicality of the market and the obsolescence in technology and shorter product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value based on backlog and forecasted demand 
backlog is subject to revisions  cancellations and rescheduling 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such difference may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product  package and speed configurations to meet forecasted customer demand 
conversely  we also attempt to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements 
we continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost 
property  plant and equipment during  we invested million in property  plant and equipment compared to million in primary investments in fiscal were for building purchases  software and semiconductor design tools  test equipment at each of our test locations  and workstations and network infrastructure 
current liabilities current liabilities decreased from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in accounts payable and deferred income on shipments to distributors 
the decrease in accounts payable was a result of lower business activity and the decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to decreased inventory levels at distributors  due to lower shipments in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents line of credit we have a million credit facility to meet occasional working capital requirements for our ireland facility 
at march   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity stockholders equity decreased by million in fiscal to  million 
the decrease was attributable to the million net loss and the acquisition of treasury stock and cumulative translation adjustment totaling million 
the decrease was partially offset by the million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans  the related tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan of million  million from unrealized gains on available for sale securities  million in deferred compensation primarily related to the rocketchips acquisition and million related to the sale of put options 
commitments approximate future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows years ended march  in thousands thereafter summary of liquidity we anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
however  the risk factors discussed below could affect our cash positions adversely 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity  procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities  development of new products  and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses that could complement our business 
we may use available cash or other sources of funding for such purposes 
factors affecting future operating results the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  intense competition and cyclical market patterns which contribute to create factors that may affect our future operating results including limited visibility of demand for products  increased dependence on turns orders orders received and shipped within the same fiscal quarter  erosion of average selling prices  shift in product mix could negatively impact gross margins  excess inventory within the supply chain  reduced capital spending by telecommunications service providers  overbuilding of original equipment manufacturers oem products  including communication infrastructure  further deterioration in demand could lead to further excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding write downs  reduction in volumes could cause lower gross margins due to higher overhead absorption costs and reduced manufacturing efficiency improvements  a prolonged global economic recession could impact demand negatively for our products  a faster than expected increase in demand could result in a shortage of capacity at our wafer providers  and an extended increase in demand could lengthen cycle times and result in higher than anticipated inventory requirements 

table of contents our results of operations are affected by several factors 
these factors include general economic conditions  those conditions specific to technology companies and to the semiconductor industry in particular  decreases in average selling prices over the life of particular products and the timing of new product introductions by us  our competitors and others 
in addition  our results of operations are affected by the ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product in a timely manner  the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies  the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors  the impact of new technologies which result in rapid escalation of demand for some products in the face of equally steep declines in demand for others  and the inability to predict the success of our customers products in their markets 
market demand for our products  particularly for those most recently introduced  can be difficult to predict  especially in light of customers demands to shorten product lead times and minimize inventory levels 
unpredictable market demand could lead to revenue volatility if we were unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products or if our customers reduced demand causes them to slow orders of our products  thereby increasing dependence on turns orders 
changes in our product mix could adversely affect gross margins 
in addition  any difficulty in achieving targeted wafer production yields could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
an increase in demand could result in longer lead times causing delays in customer production schedules 
we attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  the dynamics of the market make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult 
for example  the recent overbuilding in the telecommunications industry resulted in a reduction in capital spending causing a slowdown in orders for our products 
due to these and other factors  our past results  including those described in this report  are much less reliable predictors of the future than with companies in many older  more stable and mature industries 
based on the factors noted herein  we may experience substantial fluctuations in future operating results 
potential effect of global economic and political conditions sales and operations outside of the united states subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments 
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries 
for example  we have sales and operations in asia pacific and japan 
past economic weakness in these markets adversely affected revenues  and such conditions may occur in the future 
sales to all direct oems and distributors are denominated in us dollars 
while the recent weakness of the euro and yen against the dollar had no material impact to our business  continued weakness could lead to adverse conditions from our european and japanese customers 
customers may face reduced access to capital and exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect their ability to purchase our products 
in addition  our ability to sell at competitive prices may be diminished 
currency instability may increase credit risks as the weak currencies may impair our customers ability to repay existing obligations 
any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the near future 
our financial condition and results of operations are becoming increasingly dependent on the global economy 
any instability in worldwide economic environments  such as the terrorist attacks on september  and their aftermath  could lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers 
additional risks to us include government regulation of exports  imposition of tariffs and other potential trade barriers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and generally longer receivable collection periods 
moreover  our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political conflicts in taiwan where our main wafer provider  umc  as well as a significant number of suppliers to the semiconductor industry  end customers and contract manufacturers who provide manufacturing services worldwide  are located 
potential effect of changes to current export import laws and regulations our business is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the import or export of semiconductor products 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future or what effect  if any  such actions would have on our financial condition and results of operations 
volatility of the securities of high technology companies the securities of many high technology companies have historically been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents dependence on independent manufacturers and subcontractors we do not manufacture our own silicon wafers 
presently  all of our wafers are manufactured in taiwan by umc  in japan by seiko epson corp seiko and in the us by international business machines corporation ibm 
terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations between xilinx and these wafer foundries 
we are dependent on these foundries and others to produce wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes which include transitioning to advanced manufacturing process technologies  producing wafers at acceptable yields and delivering them in a timely manner 
while the timeliness  yield and quality of wafer deliveries have met our requirements to date  we cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our wafers will not experience future manufacturing problems  including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies 
umc s foundries in taiwan and seiko s foundries in japan as well as many of our operations in california are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the recent past 
should there be a major earthquake in our or our suppliers operating locations in the future  our operations  including our manufacturing activities  may be disrupted 
this type of disruption could result in our inability to ship products in a timely manner  thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason  including other natural disasters such as fires or floods  as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity  natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our products  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are also dependent on subcontractors located in asia to provide semiconductor assembly services 
any prolonged inability to obtain wafers or assembly services with competitive performance and cost attributes  adequate yields or timely delivery  or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply  could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on new products our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price  density  functionality  and performance 
the success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors  including timely completion of new product designs  ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies including a transition to millimeter wafers as well as to circuit geometries smaller than micron  achieving acceptable yields  ability to obtain adequate product production from our wafer foundries and assembly subcontractors  ability to obtain advanced packaging  availability of supporting software design tools  utilization of predefined cores of logic  industry acceptance  and successful deployment of systems by our customers 
we cannot assure that our product development efforts will be successful  that our new products will achieve industry acceptance or that we will achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per unit cost reductions 
revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the future 
as a result  we will be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from newer products along with cost reductions on current products 
we rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features and other price performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins 
to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner  or to the extent that our products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

we cannot assure that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
from time to time  third parties  including our competitors  have asserted patent  copyright  and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us 
we cannot assure that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future  that assertions by third parties will not result in costly litigation or that we would prevail in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
euro currency beginning in  member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
during the three year transition  the euro was available for non cash transactions and legacy currencies remained legal tender 
in january  the euro replaced the sovereign currencies of the member countries 
the conversion process did not have a material adverse impact on our operations and systems 
however  we are continuing to assess the euro s impact on our business 
litigation we are currently engaged in several legal matters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
the portfolio includes tax advantaged municipal bonds  tax advantaged auction rate preferred municipal bonds  commercial paper  and us treasury securities 
in accordance with our investment policy  we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our available for sale securities and the impact on our investment portfolio would be less than million 
foreign currency risk sales to all direct oems and distributors are denominated in us dollars 
sales to japanese distributors were denominated in yen until july  our purchases of processed silicon wafers from japanese foundries were primarily denominated in us dollars for all years presented 
during the time our transactions with japanese distributors were denominated in yen  we entered into forward currency exchange contracts to reduce financial market risks 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions  for which a firm commitment had been attained  were deferred and included in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying transactions were settled 
gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria were recognized in income in the current period 
effective july   we converted all japanese customers to us dollar invoicing and therefore we expect to have minimal yen currency exposure in the future 
we are expanding our ireland facility and we have two outstanding forward currency exchange contracts against the euro 
the total value of these contracts is approximately us million 
the two contracts expired between april and may we anticipate purchasing additional euro forward contracts to reduce exposures as construction commitments increase 
our investments in several subsidiaries and in the umc securities are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at each quarter end during consolidation  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
if permanent changes  other than a temporary impairment  occur in exchange rates after an investment is made  the investment s value will increase or decrease accordingly 
these fluctuations are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
also  as our subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in other than local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations will occur
