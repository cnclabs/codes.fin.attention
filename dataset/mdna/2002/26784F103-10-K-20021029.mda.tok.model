item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
statements regarding future economic performance  management s plans and objectives  and any statements concerning its assumptions related to the foregoing contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations constitute forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements  accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this report  including without limitation  the factors disclosed under risk factors 
general in may  the company acquired dynamex express  the ground courier operations of air canada dynamex express  which was led by richard k 
mcclelland  the company s chief executive officer  and which had a national network of locations across canada 
in december  the company acquired the on demand ground courier operations of mayne nickless incorporated and mayne nickless canada inc which had operations in eight us cities and two canadian cities 
in august in conjunction with its initial public offering ipo  the company acquired five same day delivery businesses in three us and two canadian cities 
subsequent to the ipo and through july   the company acquired same day delivery businesses in six us and two canadian cities 
between august  and july   the company acquired nine same day delivery businesses in eight us cities and one canadian city 
in august  the company acquired two same day delivery businesses in two us cities 
as a result of these various acquisitions  the historical operating results of the company for the periods prior to fiscal are not necessarily comparable 
sales consist primarily of charges to customers for individual delivery services and weekly or monthly charges for recurring services  such as fleet management 
sales are recognized when the service is performed 
the yield value per transaction for a particular service is dependent upon a number of factors including size and weight of articles transported  distance transported  special handling requirements  requested delivery time and local market conditions 
generally  articles of greater weight transported over longer distances and those that require special handling produce higher yields 
cost of sales consists of costs relating directly to performance of services  including driver and messenger costs and third party delivery charges  if any 
substantially all of the drivers used by the company own their own vehicles  and approximately of these owner operators are independent contractors as opposed to employees of the company 
drivers and messengers are generally compensated based on a percentage of the delivery charge 
consequently  the company s driver and messenger costs are variable in nature 
to the extent that the drivers and messengers are employees of the company  employee benefit costs related to them  such as payroll taxes and insurance  are also included in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs incurred at the branch level related to taking orders and dispatching drivers and messengers  as well as administrative costs related to such functions 
also included in selling  general and administrative expenses are regional and corporate level marketing and administrative costs and occupancy costs related to branch and corporate locations 
generally  the company s on demand services provide higher gross profit margins than do scheduled distribution or fleet management services because driver compensation for on demand services is generally lower as a percentage of sales from such services 
however  scheduled distribution and fleet management services generally have fewer administrative requirements related to order taking  dispatching drivers and billing 
as a result of these variances  the company s margins are dependent in part on the mix of business for a particular period 
as the company has no significant investment in transportation equipment  depreciation and amortization expense primarily relates to depreciation of office  communication and computer equipment and the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the company s various acquisitions  each of which has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
effective august  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that the company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal and recognized a transitional goodwill impairment loss related to its united states operations of million and recorded the charge net of million of deferred tax benefits as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations 
the valuations performed as part of the analysis employed a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value corroborated by comparisons to estimated market multiples 
third party specialists were engaged to assist in the valuations 
as required by sfas no 
 the charge was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year a significant portion of the company s revenues is generated in canada 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues were generated in canada 
before deduction of corporate costs  the majority of which are incurred in the us  the cost structure of the company s operations in the us and in canada is very similar 
consequently  when expressed as a percentage of us or canadian sales  as appropriate  the operating profit generated in each such country before deduction of corporate costs is not materially different 
the conversion rate between the us dollar and canadian dollar decreased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  and during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  as the canadian dollar is the functional currency for the company s canadian operations  these changes in the exchange rate have affected the company s reported revenues 
the effect of these changes on the company s net income loss for the fiscal years ended july   and has not been significant  although there can be no assurance that fluctuations in such currency exchange rate will not  in the future  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their issuance 
intangibles intangibles arise from acquisitions accounted for as purchased business combinations and include goodwill  covenants not to compete and other identifiable intangibles and from the payment of financing costs associated with the company s credit facility 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
effective august  the company adopted sfas no which requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill 
amortization of goodwill totaled million in each of the years ended july  and other intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
self insured claims liability 
we retain the risk of loss for workers compensation claims 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but unreported losses  are recorded based on the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
these estimates include the company s actual experience based on information received from the company s insurance carrier and historical assumptions of development of unpaid liabilities over time 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued for workers compensation claims include  but are not limited to  cost  frequency  or payment patterns resulting from new types of claims  the hazard level of our operations  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions  court interpretations  changes in the medical conditions of claimants and economic factors such as inflation the method of calculating the estimated accrued liability for workers compensation claims is subject to inherent uncertainty 
if actual results are less favorable than what are used to calculate the accrued liability  we would have to record expenses in excess of what has already been accrued 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
estimates are used in determining this allowance based on the company s historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required

as well as one time charges totaling million associated with restructuring canadian operations 
net income for includes other income of approximately million related to the settlement of claims related to the shareholder class action lawsuit and gains on sales of surplus radio licenses of million 
the following discussion and analysis excludes the aforementioned goodwill impairment  non recurring and unusual charges and adjustments 
sales for the year ended july  were million compared to million in  a decline of approximately 
the decline is attributable to a number of factors 
first  the economic slowdown in the us and canada that began during the second half of fiscal continued and had a negative impact on sales in  primarily on demand services 
second  the decline in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar had the effect of reducing sales by slightly over million had the exchange rate been the same as the prior year 
third  the phase out of a contract with a single customer negatively impacted sales by approximately million during  and sales growth for the fiscal year will be negatively impacted by approximately million of sales to this customer 
while the company is disappointed in the loss of this contract  a large portion of the services provided is not part of the company s core competencies 
cost of sales decreased million to million in compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales increased from in to in this increase in cost is primarily attributable to a change in the overall business mix of the company 
on demand sales were approximately of total sales in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year scheduled and distribution and other specialized service revenues increased as a percentage of total sales while on demand revenues have declined both as percentage of sales and in absolute dollars 
historically on demand revenues have lower cost of sales and higher selling  general and administrative costs compared to scheduled and distribution and other specialized service revenues 
as a result of this change in business mix  cost of sales has increased as a percentage of sales while selling  general and administrative sg a costs have declined as a percentage of sales 
sg a costs were million for the fiscal year ended july  compared to million for the year ended july  as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased from in to in the decline from to is attributable to a number of factors 
compensation and employee benefits declined million as a result of the change in the business mix that requires fewer personnel in the dispatch and customer service areas  as well as lower administrative salaries due to fewer personnel 
through on going cost reduction initiatives  the company has eliminated approximately million of non essential employee related costs including travel and entertainment  as well as reductions of over  of communication  occupancy and other office costs 
management anticipates that sg a costs as a percentage of sales for fiscal will remain at or slightly below current levels 
depreciation and amortization was million in compared to million in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the adoption of sfas no 
million  which requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill  and the reduction in amortization of covenants not to compete that are fully amortized after three years million 
most of the company s acquisitions occurred in fiscal years through  therefore  all covenants were fully amortized in fiscal and prior years 
interest expense decreased million or in the fiscal year ended july  compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a lower level of debt in and lower interest rates compared to the prior year 
year ended july  compared to year ended july  net income for the year ended july  was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended july  net income for includes other income of approximately million related to the settlement of claims related to the shareholder class action lawsuit and gains on sales of surplus radio licenses of million 
the results for include a provision for the settlement of the shareholder class action lawsuit of million 
the company also provided a valuation allowance of approximately million for federal net operating losses and the shareholder class action lawsuit settlement incurred in the fiscal year ended july  the following discussion and analysis excludes the aforementioned non recurring and unusual charges and adjustments 
sales for the year ended july  were million compared to million in  a decline of less than 
the decline is attributable to a number of factors 
first  the company exited approximately million of marginally profitable business in several locations in canada at the beginning of fiscal year second  the economic slowdown in the us negatively impacted us sales in  primarily in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
third  the decline in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar had the effect of reducing sales by slightly over million had the exchange rate been the same as the prior year 
cost of sales increased million to million in compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales increased from in to in this increase in cost is primarily attributable to a change in the overall business mix of the company 
on demand sales were approximately of total sales in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year scheduled and distribution and other specialized service revenues increased as a percentage of total sales while on demand revenues have declined both as percentage of sales and in absolute dollars 
historically on demand revenues have lower cost of sales and higher selling  general and administrative costs compared to scheduled and distribution and other specialized service revenues 
as a result of this change in business mix  cost of sales has increased as a percentage of sales while sg a costs have declined as a percentage of sales 
sg a costs were million for the fiscal year ended july  compared to million for the year ended july  as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased from in to in the decline from to is attributable to a number of factors 
sales commissions were lower million in the current year due to a decline in new sales that was due  in large part  to the slowing us economy in the dallas and chicago branch operations were restructured along with cost saving initiatives at other locations resulting in reduced administrative costs million and improved profitability 
in the prior year  the company incurred contract accounting labor costs million associated with the audit of fiscal year and the re audit of fiscal years and legal and other professional fees associated with the class action lawsuit were substantially less million than the prior year because of the settlement announced early in fiscal year the consolidation of certain administrative functions including billing and collections resulted in reduced employee related costs in fiscal year in the prior year  the company also invested more heavily in technology in building its infrastructure 
depreciation and amortization was million in compared to million in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to the reduction in amortization of covenants not to compete that are fully amortized after three years and to a reduction in depreciation of property and equipment 
most of the company s acquisitions occurred in fiscal years through  therefore  all covenants were fully amortized prior to or during the current fiscal year 
in addition certain property and equipment acquired through acquisitions has been fully depreciated and has not been replaced with new equipment because the old equipment is still in service 
also the company has or will replace driver communication equipment with two way mobile data units that do not require an up front capital expenditure by the company 
interest expense decreased million or in the fiscal year ended july  compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a lower level of debt in and lower interest rates in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year 
in the prior year fourth quarter  the bank group imposed the default rate of interest in accordance with the bank credit agreement because the company did not have audited financial statements on file with the securities and exchange commission for the prior three years 
also in the prior year fourth quarter  the company was assessed special fees by the bank group of approximately  liquidity and capital resources in fiscal years ended july   and  the company s capital needs arose primarily from its capital expenditures and working capital needs 
there were no acquisitions made in fiscal year  or as of july   the company s bank credit agreement consisted of an amortizing term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of million due november  on november   the company amended its bank credit agreement 
under the terms of the third amended and restated credit agreement  the company prepaid million of the amortizing term loan from available cash and the facility was extended through february  the revolving credit facility is governed by an eligible accounts receivable borrowing base agreement  defined as of accounts receivable less than days past due 
required principal payments on the amortizing term loan consist of million quarterly  until maturity  at which time any amounts outstanding under the facility are due 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly at prime plus or libor plus 
in addition  the company is required to pay a commitment fee of for any unused amounts of the revolving credit facility 
effective september   the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to november  the amended facility consists of an amortizing term loan of million and a million revolving credit facility 
as of july  borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled approximately  and the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling  amounts outstanding under the credit facility are secured by all of the company s us assets and of the stock of the company s principal canadian subsidiaries 
the agreement contains restrictions on the payment of dividends  incurring additional debt  capital expenditures and investments by the company 
in addition  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios related to minimum amounts of stockholders equity  fixed charges to cash flow and funded debt to cash flow  and to reduce the amortizing term loan principal at the end of each quarter beginning july   by the amount of excess cash flow  all as defined in the agreement 
the agreement also requires the company to obtain the consent of the lender for additional acquisitions in certain instances 
on october  the credit agreement was amended to adjust the financial ratio related to the minimum amount of stockholders equity 
this amendment had been contemplated by the company and its lenders and was necessary as a result of the impact of the goodwill impairment recorded upon adoption of sfas no 
the company has entered into various interest rate protection agreements on a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
on november   the company entered into an interest rate protection arrangement on million of the borrowings under the credit agreement 
the interest rate has been fixed at 
this arrangement matures february  at july   the company had unpaid settlements of approximately related to the interest rate swap 
the fair value of this agreement at july  and was a liability of approximately and  respectively 
at july  the weighted average interest rate for all outstanding borrowings was approximately during the fiscal years ended july   and  the company spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  on capital expenditures  which expenditures primarily related to improvements in infrastructure and technology to support the company s operations 
management expects the amount of capital expenditures for these purposes in future years to be at or slightly above expenditures made in the year ended july  the company does not have significant capital expenditure requirements to replace or expand the number of vehicles used in its operations because substantially all of its drivers are owner operators who provide their own vehicles 
the company s expansion of its national marketing program consists primarily of increased hiring and salary expenditures related to additional product specialists 
these marketing expenditures have not  nor does management expect that in the future they will have  a significant impact on the company s liquidity 
see business sales and marketing 
the company s cash flow provided by operations for the fiscal years ended july   and were approximately million  and million  respectively 
consequently  increases in working capital and purchases of property and equipment during such periods were financed entirely by internally generated cash flow 
changes in working capital provided million of operating cash flow in fiscal  compared to uses of operating cash flow totaling million and million in the years ended july  and  respectively 
management expects that its future capital requirements will generally be met from internally generated cash flow 
the company s access to other sources of capital  such as additional bank borrowings and the issuance of debt securities  is affected by  among other things  general market conditions affecting the availability of such capital 
the company completed its last acquisition in august currently there are no pending nor are there any contemplated acquisitions 
should the company pursue acquisitions in the future  the company may be required to incur additional debt 
there can be no assurance that the company s primary lenders will consent to such acquisitions or that if additional financing is necessary  it can be obtained on terms the company deems acceptable 
as a result  the company may be unable to make additional acquisitions 
the company leases certain equipment and properties under non cancelable lease agreements  which expire at various dates 
at july  minimum annual lease payments for such leases are as follows thereafter income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal  compared to million and million in the years ended july  and  respectively 
the difference between the statutory rates and the effective federal income tax rates is primarily attributable to foreign and state income taxes  changes in the valuation allowance on net operating loss carryforwards  and other expenses that are non deductible for tax purposes 
the company has incurred taxable net operating losses in the united states of   and  for the years ended july   and  respectively 
in addition  the company has generated unused foreign tax credits related to its canadian operations and other tax credits of  the company has established valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
for us operating losses and foreign and other tax credits not currently deductible 
the company continually reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowance and releases the allowance  when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
the remaining deferred tax assets represent deductions made for financial statement purposes that are available to offset future taxable income 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s results of operations nor does it believe it will do so in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
financial condition the company believes its financial condition remains strong and that it has the financial resources necessary to meet its needs 
cash provided by operating activities and the company s credit facility should be sufficient to meet the company s operational needs 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb finalized statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that the fair value for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made  and that the carrying amount of the asset  including capitalized asset retirement costs  be tested for impairment 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  management does not believe this statement will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb finalized statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
prescribes financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and specifies when to test a long lived asset for recoverability 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management does not believe this statement will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 

this statement eliminates the current requirement that gains and losses on debt extinguishment must be classified as extraordinary items in the income statement 
instead  such gains and losses will be classified as extraordinary items only if they are deemed to be unusual and infrequent  in accordance with the current gaap criteria for extraordinary classification 
in addition  sfas no 
eliminates an inconsistency in lease accounting by requiring that modifications of capital leases that result in reclassification as operating leases be accounted for consistent with sale leaseback accounting rules 
the statement also contains other non substantive corrections to authoritative accounting literature 
the changes related to debt extinguishment will be effective for fiscal years beginning after may   and the changes related to lease accounting will be effective for transactions occurring after may  adoption of this standard will not have any immediate effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company will apply this guidance prospectively 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities exchange act of while the company believes its strategic plan is on target and the business outlook remains strong  several important factors have been identified  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted 
by way of example o the competitive nature of the same day delivery business 
o the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified courier personnel as well as retain key management personnel 
o a change in the current tax status of courier drivers from independent contractor drivers to employees or a change in the treatment of the reimbursement of vehicle operating costs to employee drivers 
o a significant reduction in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
o failure of the company to maintain required certificates  permits or licenses  or to comply with applicable laws  ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of the company s authority to conduct certain of its operations 
o the ability of the company to obtain adequate financing 
o the ability of the company to pass on fuel cost increases to customers to maintain profit margins and the quality of driver pay 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange exposure significant portions of the company s operations are conducted in canada 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us and canadian dollar result in fluctuations in the amounts relating to the canadian operations reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company historically has not entered into hedging transactions with respect to its foreign currency exposure  but may do so in the future 
the sensitivity analysis model used by the company for foreign exchange exposure compares the revenue and net income figures from canadian operations over the previous four quarters at the actual exchange rate versus a decrease in the exchange rate 
based on this model  a decrease would result in a decrease in revenue of million and a decrease in net income of 
million over this period 
there can be no assurances that the above projected exchange rate decrease will materialize 
fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond the control of the company s management 
interest rate exposure the company has entered into interest rate protection arrangements on a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility 
on november   the company entered into an interest rate protection arrangement on million of borrowings under the credit agreement 
the interest rate on million was fixed at 
this arrangement matures on february  the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the sensitivity analysis model used by the company for interest rate exposure compares interest expense fluctuations over a one year period based on current debt levels and current interest rates versus current debt levels at current interest rates with a increase 
based on this model  a increase would result in an increase in interest expense of 
million 
there can be no assurances that the above projected interest rate increase will materialize 
fluctuations of interest rates are beyond the control of the company s management
