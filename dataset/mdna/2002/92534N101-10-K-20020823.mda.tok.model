item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview memberworks addresses the needs of organizations seeking to leverage the expertise of an outside provider in offering membership service programs 
membership service programs offer selected products and services from a variety of vendors for a monthly or annual fee 
membership service programs intend to enhance existing relationships between businesses and consumers 
memberworks derives its revenues principally from annually renewable membership fees 
the company generally receives full payment of annual fees at or near the beginning of the membership period  but recognizes revenue as the member s refund privilege expires 
similarly  the costs associated with soliciting each new member  as well as the cost of royalties  are recognized as the related revenue is recognized 
profitability and cash flow generated from renewal memberships exceed that of new memberships due to the absence of solicitation costs associated with new member procurement 
critical accounting policies on december   the securities and exchange commission issued financial reporting release frr no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggesting that companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical to their organization 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are important to the company s financial condition and results and involve subjective or complex judgments on the part of management  often as a result of the need to make estimates 
the following areas all require the use of judgments and estimates membership cancellation rates  deferred marketing costs  intangible assets and income taxes 
estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and various assumptions that memberworks believes are appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
memberworks believes the following represent the critical accounting policies of the company as contemplated by frr for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements located in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition membership fees are billed through clients of the company primarily through credit cards 
during an initial annual membership term or renewal term  a member may cancel his or her membership in the program  either for a complete refund of the membership fee for that period or a prorata refund based on the remaining portion of the membership period depending upon the terms of the membership program 
deferred membership fees are recorded  net of estimated cancellations  after the trial period has expired  and are amortized as revenues from membership fees upon the expiration of membership refund privileges 
an allowance for cancellations is established based on management s estimates and is updated regularly 
in determining the estimate of allowance for cancellations  management analyzes historical cancellation experience  current economic trends and changes in customer demand for the company s products 
actual membership cancellations are charged against the allowance for cancellations on a current basis 
if actual cancellations differ from the estimate  the results of operations would be impacted 
accrued liabilities set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of june  and include an allowance for membership cancellations of million and million  respectively 
membership solicitation and other deferred costs membership solicitation costs include marketing and direct mail costs related directly to membership solicitation ie  direct response advertising costs 
in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  reporting on advertising costs  direct response advertising costs are deferred and charged to operations as revenues from membership fees are recognized 
other deferred costs consist of royalties paid to clients  which relate to the same revenue streams as the direct response advertising costs and are also charged to income over the membership period 
membership solicitation costs incurred to obtain a new member generally are less than the estimated total membership fees 
however  if membership solicitation costs were to exceed total estimated membership fees  an adjustment would be made to the extent of any impairment 
goodwill and other intangibles in connection with the implementation of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  memberworks reviewed the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets by comparing such amounts to their fair values 
the company determined that at july   there was an impairment of goodwill of million at one of its reporting units due to the change in methodology of calculating impairment under sfas concurrent with recent downward trends in the operations of that reporting unit see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
this amount was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the statement of operations in the fiscal quarter ended september  memberworks is required to perform this comparison at least annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment 
when determining fair value  the company utilizes various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such an event  memberworks would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would impact earnings 
income taxes income taxes are determined in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of liabilities and assets using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas also provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets for which realization may not be likely 
as of june  and  the deferred tax asset of million and million  respectively  has been fully reserved 
in assessing the valuation allowance  memberworks has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies

new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas  which was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption was permitted for entities with fiscal years beginning after march   provided that the first interim financial statements have not been previously issued 
the company adopted sfas effective july  sfas addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets should be accounted for in the financial statements upon their acquisition and after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized but rather be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives be amortized over their useful lives 
with the adoption of sfas  the company reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets to make any necessary amortization period adjustments 
based on that assessment  only goodwill was determined to have an indefinite useful life and no adjustments were made to the amortization period or residual values of other intangible assets 
the company determined that at july   there was an impairment of goodwill of million at one of its reporting units due to the change in methodology of calculating impairment under sfas concurrent with recent downward trends in the operations of the reporting unit 
this amount was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the statement of operations during the fiscal quarter ended september  in august  the fasb issued statement no

forward looking statements this annual report filed on form k contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industry in which memberworks operates and the company s management s beliefs and assumptions 
forward looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and can be identified by the use of words such as believe  expect  estimate  project  continue or anticipate 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  cannot be foreseen and reflect future business decisions that are subject to change 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
among the many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements are the company s ability to integrate acquired businesses into the company s management and operations and operate successfully  changes in the marketing techniques of credit card issuers  increases is the level of commission rates and other compensation required by marketing partners to actively market with memberworks  unanticipated cancellation or termination of marketing agreements and the extent to which memberworks can continue successful development and marketing of new products and services  higher than expected membership cancellations  potential requirements by business partners such as the company s payment processors  lower than expected membership renewal rates  unanticipated changes in or termination of the company s ability to process membership fees through third parties  including clients  payment processors and bank card associations  the company s ability to introduce new programs on a timely basis  the company s ability to develop and implement operational and financial systems to manage rapidly growing operations  the company s ability to recover from a complete or partial system failure or impairment  other hardware or software related malfunctions or programming errors  the company s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms to finance the company s growth strategy and to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements  further changes in the already competitive environment for the company s products or competitors responses to the company s strategies  changes in the growth rate of the overall us economy  or the international economy where memberworks does business  such that credit availability  interest rates  consumer spending and related consumer debt are impacted  additional government regulation of the company s industry  and new accounting pronouncements many of these factors are beyond memberworks control  and  therefore  its ability to generate predictable revenue and income growth may be adversely affected by these factors 
memberworks cautions that such factors are not exclusive 
all of the forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k are qualified by these cautionary statements and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
except as required under the federal exchange commission  memberworks does not have any intention or obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate the company has an million bank credit facility which bears interest at the higher of the base commercial lending rate for the bank or the federal funds rate plus per annum 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this bank credit facility as of june  management believes that an increase in the commercial lending rate or the federal funds rate would not be material to the company s financial position or its results of operations 
if the company is not able to renew its existing credit facility agreement  which matures on april   it is possible that any replacement lending facility obtained by the company may be more sensitive to interest rate changes 
the company does not currently hedge interest rates with respect to its outstanding debt 
foreign currency the company has international sales and facilities in canada and therefore  is subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
canadian sales have been denominated in the canadian dollar and its functional currency is the local currency 
assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiary are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period 
accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations  and were not material for all periods presented 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic condition 
to the extent the company incurs expenses that are based on locally denominated sales volume paid in local currency  the exposure to foreign exchange risk is reduced 
the company has determined that the impact of a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company does not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the company s adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
memberworks will assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis

however  this does not preclude the company s adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
