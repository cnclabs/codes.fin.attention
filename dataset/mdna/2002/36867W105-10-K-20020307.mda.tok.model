item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
for this purpose  statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance 
actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the heading factors affecting future operating results 
overview since our inception  we have incurred significant operating losses  and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the majority of our operating losses have resulted from costs we incurred developing our hap technology and initiating our hap drug program 
we expect to dedicate a significant portion of our resources for the foreseeable future to develop further and maintain our hap technology and to expand and intensify our commercialization activities  including the development of our hap drugs 
to date  our revenue has been primarily from licensing and service fees from our agreements with janssen research foundation  pfizer  inc and gene logic  inc  and to a less extent  from a sublicensing agreement with visible genetics  inc and government grants 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue consists primarily of proceeds received in connection with the licensing of our hap technology  service revenue and sublicensing of patents 
revenue increased to million in from  in the increase in license revenues is attributable to the commercialization of our hap partnership program  including an agreement entered into with pfizer during  as well as agreements entered into with janssen research foundation and gene logic  inc during revenue from each of janssen research foundation  gene logic  inc and pfizer  inc accounted for or more of our total revenue in fiscal janssen research foundation  gene logic  inc and visible genetics  inc 
each accounted for or more of our total revenue in we are recognizing the annual license and subscription fees over the term of the agreements and the service fees as the services are performed 
future milestone and royalty payments  when and if received  will be recognized when earned 
revenue also includes the amortization  over the remaining life of the sublicensed patent  of upfront payments received in connection with the sublicensing of a patent 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits for research and development personnel  materials and reagent costs  costs incurred in connection with clinical trials  depreciation and maintenance costs for equipment used for hap marker discovery and hap typing  and facility related costs 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in research and development expenses in is primarily attributable to an increase in expenditures related to our clinical trials  the expansion of our hap typing process  and the increase in resources dedicated to supporting and improving our proprietary decogen registered trademark informatics system 
the increase in expenses includes a million increase in costs related to our clinical trials  a million increase in payroll and related costs  a million increase in technology licenses and a million increase in depreciation expense 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development expenses in the near future as we develop our candidate hap drugs  increase the use of our hap typing facility  prosecute our patent applications  and continue to invest in ongoing product development and improvements related to our decogen registered trademark informatics system 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related costs for executive  business development  finance  public affairs and other administrative personnel  as well as facility related costs and outside professional fees incurred in connection with corporate development  general legal and financial matters 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to increased salary and related costs as a result of the expansion of our business development activities and the additional costs of operating as a public company for a full fiscal year 
sublicensing royalty expense represents royalty obligations incurred by us on sublicensing fees that we receive 
sublicensing royalty expense decreased to  in from  in this decrease relates primarily to a nonrefundable cash payment received in in connection with an amendment to a patent sublicensing agreement 
we elected to recognize this expense in as paid 
stock based and other non cash compensation expense relates to options granted to employees  scientific advisory board members and consultants and a sale of stock in in exchange for notes between two of our officers and a former executive 
we recognized the sale of stock between the officers and the former executive as compensatory and accordingly recognized non cash compensation 
we account for options granted to employees in accordance with accounting principals board opinion  or apb no 
the accounting for scientific advisory board members and consultants requires us to record periodic charges for unvested options based on an increase in the fair value of our common stock and the related vesting of the options 
stock based compensation decreased to  in from million in the decrease is primarily due to our decision to vest fully all unvested options previously granted to scientific advisory board members in march  which resulted in a one time expense of approximately million  as well as the recording of approximately million of expense related to the officer stock purchase agreement due to the increase in the fair value of the stock through the date of our initial public offering 
future unamortized compensation expense associated with outstanding stock options at december  is approximately  interest income expense  net decreased to approximately million in from million in the decrease is the result of higher cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances in as a result of proceeds received from our sale of series b and series c preferred stock in february and march  respectively  and our initial public offering in august the decrease is also the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of higher capital lease and other debt obligations to fund the acquisition of equipment and partially fund the expansion of our facilities 
state income tax benefit of million represents a net tax benefit from the state of connecticut as a result of recent legislation which allows companies to receive cash refunds from the state at a rate of of their incremental research and development tax credit  as defined  in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of the research and development tax credit 
years ended december  and revenue increased to  in from  in the increase in revenues is due to a  increase in license fees from to  offset by a  decrease in grant research revenue 
the increase in license revenues is attributable to the commercialization of our hap partnership program and agreements entered into with janssen research foundation and gene logic  inc revenue from each of janssen research foundation  gene logic  inc 
and visible genetics accounted for or more of our total revenue in visible genetics also accounted for or more of revenue in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in expenditures is primarily attributable to the significant increase in the discovery of hap markers during  the initiation of our hap typing facility  the increase in informatics personnel focused on improvements to our proprietary decogen registered trademark informatics system  the costs of preparing to launch our first clinical trial and an increase in patent personnel and patent applications 
the increase in expense includes a million increase in laboratory supplies  a million increase in payroll and related costs and a million increase in depreciation expense 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in payroll and related costs and a million increase in professional fees 
sublicensing royalty expense increased to  in from  in the increase primarily relates to a nonrefundable cash payment received in in connection with an amendment to a patent sublicensing agreement 
stock based compensation expense increased to million in from  in the increase is primarily due to our decision to vest fully all unvested stock options previously granted to scientific advisory board members in march  which resulted in a one time expense of approximately million  as well as the recording of approximately million of expense related to the officer stock purchase agreement due to the increase in the fair value of the stock through the date of our initial public offering 
interest income expense  net increased to income of million in from expense of  in the increase in net income was due to proceeds received from our sale of series b and series c preferred stock in february and march  respectively  and our initial public offering in august liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the private and public sale of common and preferred stock  government research grants  payments under licensing agreements  loans and capital leases 
from inception through december   we have received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million from issuance of common and preferred stock 
in addition  through december   we had received million of government grant funding and million from license and service fees  royalties and research contracts 
we also have received million from capital lease financing arrangements and million from other loans 
through december   we have acquired million of property and equipment 
these assets were largely financed through capital lease financing arrangements and other loans 
we expect to finance our operations  in the short term  from cash we received in from sales of our common and preferred stock and revenue from our hap partnership program 
our business strategy depends on entering into agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for our hap partnership program and to co develop and or co market our hap drug candidates 
if we are unsuccessful in marketing our hap technology and our hap drugs  we may not generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations at planned levels 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the same period in for the year ended december   our net loss of million was partially offset by non cash charges of  for stock based compensation expense  non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization expense and by a million increase in accrued expenses 
cash used in operations was also impacted by a million decrease in accounts payable and a million increase in state income tax receivable 
for the year ended december   our net loss of million was partially offset by non cash charges of million for stock based compensation expense  non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization expense and increases of  and million in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue  respectively 
cash provided by investing activities was million in compared with cash used for investing activities of million in in  we used cash to purchase million of property and equipment and received proceeds of million from the reduction of investments in marketable securities 
in  we used cash to purchase million of property and equipment and invested million in marketable securities 
cash used in financing activities was million in compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in during  we repaid debt of approximately million while  during  we received net proceeds of million through issuance of preferred and common stock 
our contractual cash obligations as of december   are as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total amounts committed year years and years and year and later long term debt   capital lease obligations    operating leases      minimum license obligations   total contractual cash obligations      long term debt consists primarily of three financing agreements with connecticut innovations inc cii  a stockholder of ours  used to finance certain leasehold improvements and other costs associated with our facility expansion 
the agreements provide for interest only with principal payments based on a month amortization beginning april through october  with balloon payments due in april through june borrowings under the agreements are secured by the related leasehold improvements 
capital lease obligations  related to equipment  consist principally of arrangements with four equipment leasing companies 
the leases have terms ranging from two to four years with installments ending between august and october  and bear interest at rates ranging from to 
the capital lease arrangements allow for the purchase of the related equipment at the completion of the lease term  as defined in the agreements 
we lease our operating facilities located in new haven  connecticut 
the lease agreements require annual lease payments of  per year increasing to million per year over the original term  which expires in we have two five year renewal options to extend the lease agreements beyond the initial term 
we are recording the expense associated with the lease on a straight line basis over the expected term of the lease 
in addition to the operating lease agreements for our current facility  we also have operating leases for various office equipment 
in addition  we periodically enter into agreements with third parties to obtain exclusive or non exclusive licenses for certain technologies 
the terms of certain of these agreements require us to pay future royalty payments and certain milestone payments based on product sales or sublicense income generated from applicable technologies  if any 
the amount of such payments will depend upon successful commercialization of applicable technologies  if any 
the future minimum payments assuming non termination of these agreements are included in the minimum license contractual obligations above 
capital expenditures are not expected to exceed to million for each of fiscal and our cash requirements will vary depending upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the demand for our hap technology  the efforts and success of our hap partnership program  the results of our hap drug program  the commercialization of intellectual property derived from our hap drug program  the level of competition we face  our ability to maintain and develop our hap technology  and our ability to manage effectively our operating expenses 
on december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million compared to million at december  our cash reserves are held in interest bearing  high grade corporate bonds and money market accounts 
we believe that our existing cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our expected net losses  debt obligations and capital expenditures for at least months 
to execute our business plan  we will need to seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or commercial partners 
subject to market conditions and other factors  we intend to pursue opportunities to raise additional funding during the remainder of the current year 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain additional partners or capital funding on acceptable terms  if at all 
income taxes we have not generated any taxable income to date and  therefore  have not paid any federal income taxes since inception 
on december   we had available unused net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  which may be available to offset future federal and state taxable income  respectively 
use of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  which will begin to expire in and  respectively  may be subject to limitations 
the future utilization of these carryforwards may be limited due to changes within our current and future ownership structure as defined within the income tax code 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  which consists primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  because of uncertainty regarding its recoverability  as required by financial accounting standard no 
accounting for income taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and for hedging activities which  as amended by sfas  provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities  was required for fiscal years beginning after january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition as the company holds no derivative financial instruments and does not currently engage in hedging activities 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
significantly impact the accounting and disclosures for business combinations 
the adoption of sfas no 
 which was required for all transactions completed after june   and sfas no 
 which is required for fiscal years beginning after december   will have no historical impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
modifies the rules for accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the new rules become effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application encouraged 
the company does not believe that the adoption of this principle will have a material impact on either the operating results or the financial position of the company 
factors affecting future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management based on information currently available to our management 
use of words such as believes  expects  anticipates  intends  plans  estimates  should  likely or similar expressions  indicate a forward looking statement 
forward looking statements involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
certain of the information contained in this annual report on form k consists of forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include the following we are an early stage company that may never be profitable 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception 
as of december   we have generated only minimal revenue from our hap technology  and we do not expect to generate significant revenues for several years  if ever 
from inception through december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses to date have resulted principally from costs we incurred in the development of our hap technology  in our clinical trials and from general and administrative costs associated with operations 
we expect to devote substantial resources to our hap drug program and to maintain and develop further our hap technology 
we expect to incur additional losses this year and in future years  and we may never achieve profitability 
in addition  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are only now beginning to use products such as ours in their drug development or marketing efforts and  accordingly  they may not choose to use our hap technology 
we do not expect our losses to be substantially mitigated by revenues from our hap partnership program or from our hap drug program for a number of years  if ever 
to generate significant revenues  we must obtain customers for our hap partnership program and successfully develop our candidate hap drugs 
our strategy depends on entering into agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for our hap partnership program and finding partners to co develop and or co market our candidate hap drugs 
to date  we have four partners for our hap partnership program  and we may not obtain additional partners for our hap partnership program or find partners to co develop and or co market our candidate hap drugs 
we currently do not have any partners to co develop and or co market our two candidate hap drugs 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining additional customers for our hap partnership program and finding partners for our hap drug program  we may never generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
in addition  we expect that some of our future hap partnership program collaborations will be limited to specific  limited term projects 
accordingly  we must continually obtain new customers to be successful 
if we are unable to identify which of our hap markers are predictive for safety and or efficacy for a candidate hap drug  we may not generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
to be successful with our hap drug program  we must discover a correlation between genomic variations and drug response 
we may not have sufficient funds to pursue our hap drug program and we may never discover any pharmaceutically relevant correlations as a result of the program 
even if we discover information on the correlation between drug response and genomic variation as a result of our hap drug program  we may be unable to find a partner to co develop and or co market the candidate hap drug on terms sufficient to recover our costs 
our hap technology may not allow our partners or us to develop commercial products or to increase sales of their currently marketed products 
we base our hap technology on the assumption that information about gene association and genomic variation may help drug development professionals better understand the drug response of particular individuals and complex disease processes 
although the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is increasing its use of genomics in analyzing drug response and diseases  we are unaware of any successful drug development program applying population genomics 
the focus of our hap technology is the rapid discovery of hap markers for all of the pharmaceutically relevant genes 
if we are unable to find hap markers for a significant portion of the pharmaceutically relevant genes in a timely manner  our potential partners may lose confidence in our hap technology and our company  and this loss in confidence could decrease our ability to generate revenues 
even if we are able to discover the hap markers for all of the pharmaceutically relevant genes  this information may not prove to be superior to genomic variation information discovered by our competitors 
furthermore  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may not choose our hap technology over competing technologies 
our decogen registered trademark informatics system may also be less effective than we expect or may not allow our partners or us to determine a correlation between genomic variation and drug response 
furthermore  even if our partners or we are successful in identifying a specific correlation between genomic variation and drug response based on our hap technology  neither our partners or us may be able to develop or sell commercially viable products nor may our partners be able to increase the sales of their existing products 
accordingly  our hap markers and hap technology may not improve the development  marketing and prescribing of drugs developed by our hap partnership program customers and the hap drugs  if any  that we co develop and or co market with partners 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient additional funding to meet our capital requirements 
we have used substantial amounts of cash to fund our research and development activities 
we will continue to spend funds to maintain and develop further our hap technology and for our hap drug program 
we plan to pay for these activities with funds from our existing cash and investment securities and income that we may receive from our hap partnership program 
we intend to rely on hap partnership program customers for significant funding in the future to support our research efforts 
we cannot be certain when we will begin to receive additional income  if at all  from our hap partnership program and income  if any  from our hap drug program 
if we do not receive this income or do not receive it as rapidly as we expect  we would spend our existing cash and investment securities more rapidly than we currently plan 
we believe that existing cash and investment securities will be sufficient to fund our expected net losses  debt obligations and capital expenditures for at least months 
we have based this belief on assumptions that may prove wrong 
to support the maintenance and further development of our hap technology and our hap drug program  we need to seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or commercial partners 
additional financing may not be on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
stockholders ownership will be diluted if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through partnerships and other licensing arrangements  we may have to relinquish rights to some of our hap technology or grant licenses on unfavorable terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we would have to scale back or terminate our hap drug program and the maintenance and further development of our hap technology 
if we are unable to obtain intellectual property protection for our hap technology  trade secrets or know how  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect our hap technology  and any other proprietary software  methods and technologies that we develop  under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the united states and other countries  so that we can prevent unauthorized entities from using our inventions and proprietary information 
because patent applications that were filed prior to november  in the united states are confidential until patents issue  third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications  and our patent applications may not have priority over any patent applications of others 
we are aware that there are other firms or individuals who have discovered  or are currently discovering  genomic variation information similar to the information we are discovering  who may have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications covering genes  gene products  snps  or haplotypes that are similar or identical to our hap technology 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including ours  are generally uncertain as a result of the uncertain state of the patent law in the biotechnology field 
there is no uniform  worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in biotechnology patents  particularly those involving genomics 
there is substantial uncertainty in the united states and abroad concerning the patent ability of genes  gene fragments  snps  or haplotypes having no known function or medical utility 
the us patent and trademark office has issued new examination guidelines that address the requirements for demonstrating the utility and describing the structure of these substances 
while the new guidelines do not require phenotypic correlation data for issuance of patents relating to human genomic variation  the guidelines have been in effect for only a short period of time and it is possible that the us patent and trademark office may interpret them in a way that could delay or adversely affect our ability or the ability of our partners to obtain patent protection 
similarly  us courts are addressing the requirements for demonstrating the utility and describing the structure of these substances in patent infringement and enforcement proceedings 
the biotechnology patent situation outside the united states is even more uncertain and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
accordingly  we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims allowed in any patents issued to us or to others 
furthermore  we must continually review our patent strategy and patent applications to address the changing legal standards in the united states and abroad 
our strategy depends on our ability to identify rapidly and seek patent protection for hap markers for all of the pharmaceutically relevant genes 
in order to do so  we must significantly increase our ability to prosecute the substantial number of resulting patent applications  as well as patent applications for the large number of discoveries we have made to date for which we have not yet filed patent applications and for which we may not obtain patents 
in order to obtain ultimately a patent on a hap marker  we may need both to discover the entire dna sequence of the gene version defined by the hap marker as well as to describe the utility of our hap marker for characterizing genomic variation that is linked to a drug response or particular disease 
this process will be expensive and time consuming  and we may not be able to increase sufficiently our patent prosecution capacity or to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner 
if we are unable to prevent others from unauthorized use of  or are unable to defend our use of  our hap technology  trade secrets or know how  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
the mere issuance of a patent does not guarantee that it is valid or enforceable  thus even if we obtain patents  they may not be valid or enforceable against third parties 
we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements  unpatented know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we generally protect this information with reasonable security measures  including confidentiality agreements signed by our employees  academic collaborators and consultants that provide that all confidential information developed or made known to others during the course of the employment  consulting or business relationship will be kept confidential except in specified circumstances 
agreements with employees  consultants and collaborators provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while employed by us are our exclusive property 
if employees  consultants or collaborators do not honor these agreements  we may not have adequate remedies for breach 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
further  a patent does not provide the patent holder with freedom to operate in a way that infringes the patent rights of others 
a third party may sue us for infringing on its patent rights 
likewise  we may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial  and the litigation would divert our management s efforts 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations 
if any party should successfully claim that the creation or use of our decogen registered trademark informatics system or hap marker data infringes upon their intellectual property rights  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  a court could require us to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license on unfavorable terms 
moreover  any legal action against us or our hap partnership program customers or any hap drug co development and or co marketing partners claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to the affected products and processes could  in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages  require us or our hap partnership program customers or any of our hap drug co development and or co marketing partners to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  some licenses may be non exclusive  and  therefore  our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be unable to market effectively some of our hap technology and hap drugs  if any  which could limit our profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations 
we may be unable to develop or commercialize our hap technology and candidate hap drugs if we cannot establish collaborative relationships  and we will depend on our partners to develop or to co develop products 
we currently have four hap partnership program customers and no partners to co develop and or co market our two candidate hap drugs 
under our current strategy  and for the foreseeable future  we do not expect to develop or market pharmaceutical products on our own 
as a result  our current and future revenues will depend on payments from our current hap partnership program customers and our future hap partnership program customers and the future co developers and co marketers of our hap drugs  if any  for either the new products they may develop  or for increased sales of their existing products  made possible through the use of our hap technology  or from hap drugs  if any  that the co developers and co marketers may sell 
if we are unable to attract additional hap partnership program customers or co developers and or co marketers for our candidate hap drugs  we may never generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
our hap partnership program customers will be responsible and our hap drug co developers probably will be responsible for pre clinical study and clinical development of therapeutic and diagnostic products and for regulatory approval  manufacturing and marketing of any products or enhanced marketing claims that result from the application of our hap technology 
we anticipate that our agreements with hap partnership program customers and hap drug co developers  if any  will allow them significant discretion in pursuing these activities 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that our current hap partnership program customers and any future hap partnership program customers will devote to our programs or potential products 
our hap partnership program arrangements may also have the effect of limiting the areas of research that we may pursue either alone or with others 
because part of our revenues will be dependent on the successful commercialization or development of our customers products  if  for any reason  a hap partnership program customer delays or abandons its development or commercialization of a product developed using our hap technology  we may receive reduced royalty or other payments or no royalty or other payments at all 
in addition  because part of our future revenues will be dependent on the successful commercialization of our hap drugs  if any  with our co developers and or co marketers  if  for any reason  a hap drug co developer and or co marketer delays or abandons its development or commercialization of our hap drug  we may receive reduced royalty or other payments or no royalty or other payments at all 
although we intend to retain the rights to all hap markers  which we discover as well as to hap markers discovered jointly with our hap partnership program customers  we may not always be able to negotiate the retention of these rights 
furthermore  disputes may arise in the future over the ownership of rights to hap markers as well as any other technology we develop with our hap partnership program customers 
these and other possible disagreements between our hap partnership program customers and us could lead to delays in the research  development or commercialization of their products 
these disagreements could also result in litigation or require arbitration to resolve 
any of these events could prevent us from effectively marketing our hap technology 
we invest considerable amounts of time  effort  and money to sell our hap technology and candidate hap drugs  and if we are unable to sell our hap technology and candidate hap drugs  we may not generate sufficient revenue to sustain our operations 
our ability to obtain customers for our hap technology and candidate hap drugs will depend in significant part upon the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry s acceptance that our hap technology can help accelerate or improve their drug development and marketing efforts 
to achieve this market acceptance  we must continue to educate the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and the public in general as to the potential benefits of our hap technology and candidate hap drugs 
most importantly  we must convince the research and development  clinical and marketing departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that our hap technology can accelerate and improve the processes for developing  marketing  and prescribing drugs and that our candidate hap drugs will be commercially viable 
given the amount of time and effort necessary to educate our potential partners  if we fail to gain this acceptance  we may never generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
in addition  each of our hap partnership program agreements and our hap drug co development and or co marketing agreements  if any  will likely involve the negotiation of agreements containing terms that may be unique to the partner involved 
we may expend substantial funds and management effort to market our hap technology and candidate hap drugs  without any resulting sales 
regulatory oversight of our hap technology and public opinion regarding ethical issues surrounding the use of genetic information may adversely affect our ability to market our hap technology and candidate hap drugs 
the secretary s advisory committee on genetic testing  an advisory panel to the secretary of the us department of health and human services  has recommended that the fda expand its regulation of genetic testing to require fda approval for all new genetic tests and labeling of genetic tests 
currently  the fda reviews only genetic tests that companies package and sell as kits 
if the fda adopts this recommendation  it could require that we apply for fda approval as a prerequisite to marketing our hap technology 
if the fda were to deny any application of this kind  we could not conduct our business and we would be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
in addition  the federal centers for disease control and the centers for medicare and medicaid services are preparing a proposed rule that would establish a genetics laboratory specialty under clia 
when this rule is finalized  our laboratory likely will be required to comply with it in order to maintain its clia certification 
moreover  our success will depend in part on the fda s and other regulatory agencies acceptance of genomic variation analysis as part of the drug approval process and  more specifically  the validity of our hap technology as a basis for identifying genomic variation and for correlating drug response with genomic variation 
without this acceptance  we may be unable to market effectively our hap technology and we may not generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
to date  the fda has not required  in connection with approving any drug  that a physician must have genomic variation information determined about a patient before the doctor prescribes a drug 
however  the fda  in one instance  has required that a physician must have gene expression information about a patient before the doctor prescribes the drug 
within the field of personalized health and medicine  governmental and other entities may enact patient privacy and healthcare laws and regulations that may limit the use of genomic variation data 
to the extent that these laws and regulations limit the use of our hap technology or impose additional costs on our partners  we may be unable to market effectively our hap technology and candidate hap drugs and we may not generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
additionally  public opinion on ethical issues related to the confidentiality and appropriate use of genetic testing results may influence governmental authorities to call for limits on  or regulation of the use of  genetic testing 
in addition  governmental authorities or other entities may call for limits on  or regulation of the use of  genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions  particularly for those that have no known cure 
the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the potential markets for our hap technology  which could prevent us from generating sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
furthermore  we may be directly subject to regulations as a provider of diagnostic information 
to the extent that these regulations restrict the sale of our hap technology or impose other costs  we may be unable to provide our hap technology to our customers on terms sufficient to recover our expenses 
if our partners do not seek  or do not receive  marketing approval for products developed  if any  using our hap technology  we may receive delayed royalty or other payments or no royalty or other payments at all 
any new drug  biologic  or new drug or biologic indication our partners or we develop using our hap technology must undergo an extensive regulatory review process in the united states and other countries before a new product or indication of this kind could be marketed 
this regulatory process can take many years and require substantial expense 
changes in fda policies and the policies of similar foreign regulatory bodies can prolong the regulatory review of each new drug or biologic license application or prevent approval of the application 
for a hap drug that contains an off patent compound in a formulation that is not significantly different than existing generic versions of the off patent compound  there can be no assurance that the hap drug  if approved  would have sufficient marketing exclusivity granted by the fda that would protect it from indirect competition by others in the marketplace 
we expect similar delays and risks in the regulatory review process for any diagnostic product  whenever this regulatory review is required 
even if a product obtains marketing clearance  a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continuing review 
a manufacturer may be forced to withdraw a product from the market if a previously unknown problem with a product becomes apparent 
because our revenues will be largely dependent on the successful commercialization or development of products using our hap technology  any delay in obtaining  failing to obtain  or failing to maintain regulatory approval for a product developed using our hap technology may delay our receipt of royalty or other payments or prevent us from receiving royalty or other payments sufficient to recover our expenses 
if our partners or we are unable to obtain fda approval for therapeutic or diagnostic products developed using our hap technology  the lack of regulatory approval will diminish the value of our hap technology and any hap drugs 
to date  no one has developed or commercialized any therapeutic or diagnostic products using our hap technology 
we expect to rely on our hap partnership program customers and our hap drug co developers  if any  to file these applications and generally direct the regulatory review process and obtain fda acceptance of our hap technology and our hap drugs 
significant resources for research  development  testing and regulatory approval of any drugs would be necessary 
our hap partnership program customers or our hap drug co developers  if any  may not submit an application for regulatory review  even if they do submit applications  they may not be able to obtain marketing clearance for any products on a timely basis  if at all 
if our partners fail to obtain required governmental approvals for therapeutic or diagnostic products  they will not be able to market these products unless and until they obtain these approvals 
moreover  we do not expect to have the resources necessary to obtain and generally direct the regulatory review process and to commercialize products  if any  on our own 
as a result  we may not receive royalty or other payments from our customers 
the occurrence of any of these events may prevent us from generating revenues sufficient to sustain our operations 
if we do not successfully distinguish and commercialize our hap technology  we may be unable to compete successfully with our competitors or to generate revenues significant to sustain our operations 
numerous entities are attempting to identify genomic variation predictive of specific diseases and drug response and to develop products and services based on these discoveries 
we face competition in these areas from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and diagnostic companies  academic and research institutions and government or other publicly funded agencies  both in the united states and abroad  most of which have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities  manufacturing and marketing experience  distribution channels and human resources than we do 
these competitors may discover  characterize or develop important technologies applying population genomics before us or our hap partnership program customers that are more effective than those technologies which we develop or which our hap partnership program customers develop  or these competitors may obtain regulatory approvals of their drugs more rapidly than our hap partnership program customers do  any of which could limit our ability to market effectively our hap technology 
some companies and governments are marketing or developing a number of databases and informatics tools to assist participants in the healthcare industry and academic researchers in the management and analysis of genomic data 
entities such as celera genomics group  incyte genomics  inc  national human genome research institute  perlegen sciences and variagenics  inc have developed or plan to develop databases containing gene sequence  gene expression  genomic variation or other genomic information and are marketing or plan to market their data to pharmaceutical companies or plan to make freely available their databases 
in addition  numerous pharmaceutical companies  such as glaxosmithkline plc  either alone or in partnership with our competitors  are developing genomic research programs that involve the use of information that can be found in these databases 
in order to compete against existing and future technologies  we will need to demonstrate to potential hap partnership program customers the value of our hap technology and that our hap technology and capabilities are superior to competing technologies 
although we believe that our focus on gene based hap markers  rather than random genomic snps  differentiates our hap technology from other technologies our competitors are developing  any hap technology improvements we create may fail to achieve greater market acceptance than the technologies developed by our competitors 
moreover  our competitors may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit our rights or our partners ability to use our hap technology to commercialize therapeutic or diagnostic products 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary methods and our hap technology  we may not be able to commercialize our hap technology and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our operations 
if the united states and foreign patent offices do not grant patents for our applications  our competitors may obtain rights to commercialize our discoveries  which would severely limit our ability to compete 
furthermore  if the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry accepts our approach based on identifying hap markers  our competitors may adopt approaches similar to ours 
also  our competitors customers may be more successful than our customers in their drug development and marketing efforts 
if the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry does not accept our approach or if our competitors are more successful than we are  we may be unable to market effectively our hap technology and  as a result  we may be unable to generate revenues sufficient to sustain our operations 
genomic technologies have undergone  and are expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant change 
our future success will depend in large part on maintaining a competitive position in the genomics field 
others may rapidly develop new technologies that may result in products or technologies becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses we incur in connection with our development 
our hap technology could become obsolete if our competitors offer less expensive or more effective drug discovery and development technologies  including technologies that may be unrelated to genomics 
we may not be able to make the enhancements to our hap technology necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies 
if we fail to maintain and further develop our computer hardware  software and related infrastructure  we could experience loss of  or delay in  revenues and market acceptance 
because our business requires manipulating and analyzing large amounts of data  we depend on the continuous  effective  reliable and secure operation of our computer hardware  software and related infrastructure 
to the extent that our hardware or software malfunctions  we will experience reduced productivity 
we protect our computer hardware through physical and software safeguards 
however  our computer hardware is still vulnerable to fire  weather  earthquake  or other natural disaster and power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software break ins  and similar events 
in addition  the software and algorithmic components of our decogen registered trademark informatics system are complex and sophisticated  and as such  could contain data  design or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
users of our system may find software defects in current or future products 
if we fail to maintain and further develop the necessary computer capacity and data to support our computational needs and our customers drug discovery and development efforts  we could experience a loss in revenues  or a delay in receiving revenues  and a delay in obtaining market acceptance for our hap technology 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  it could affect our ability to pursue business opportunities and expand our business 
we expect to continue to experience significant growth in the number of our customers 
this anticipated growth would place a significant strain on our management and operations 
we will need to continue to improve our operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures 
we will have to maintain close coordination among our production  technical  accounting  business development and research departments 
our ability to manage this anticipated growth in the number of our customers will depend upon our ability to broaden our management team and retain skilled employees 
our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and other systems  to manage multiple  concurrent hap partnership program relationships and candidates for our hap drug program and to train and manage our employees 
in addition  we must continue to invest in customer support resources as the number of our partners and their requests for support increase 
our partners are likely to have worldwide operations and may require support at multiple us and foreign sites 
if we cannot scale our business appropriately or otherwise adapt to anticipated growth in this area  a key part of our strategy may not be successful 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly  and any failure to meet financial expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our common stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect they will fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our common stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include recognition of non recurring revenues due to receipt of license fees  achievement of milestones  completion of contracts or other revenues  demand for and market acceptance of our hap partnership program and our hap drug program  timing of the execution of agreements on our hap partnership program or our hap drug program or other material contracts  our competitors announcements or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  disputes regarding patents or other intellectual property rights  securities class actions or other litigation  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the united states and other major regions in which we do business  and general and industry specific economic conditions  which may affect our partners use of our hap technology and our hap drug program 
due to volatile and unpredictable revenues and operating expenses  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that  in some future periods  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly or decline

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash equivalents and investments  all of which have maturities of less than months 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the weighted average interest rate on marketable securities at december   was approximately 
in view of the nature and mix of our total portfolio  a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our investment portfolio as of december  on december   we had aggregate fixed rate debt of approximately million  including borrowings outstanding under term loans and capital lease obligations 
the weighted average interest rate on this debt at december   was approximately 
a change in this interest rate would cause a corresponding increase in our annual expense of approximately
