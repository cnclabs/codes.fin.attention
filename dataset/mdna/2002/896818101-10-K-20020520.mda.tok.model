item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
industry trends the events of september  and their aftermath impacted both the oem and the maintenance  repair and overhaul markets 
the most direct impact from these events was an immediate reduction in commercial air travel 
according to the air transport association  commercial air travel for the month of september  as measured by revenue passenger miles flown  was down approximately from august and down approximately compared to september this significant decline has been followed by a slow  but steady  recovery  with worldwide revenue passenger miles down approximately in october and down only approximately in march when compared to prior year periods 
we believe that these improving trends should continue 
however  demand for air travel is affected by a number of factors  including the absolute level of general economic activity 
the decline in demand for air travel has negatively impacted the operating performance and profitability of the worldwide airline industry 
as a result  many airlines have reduced their fleet size by temporarily grounding or permanently retiring older and less cost effecient aircraft 
new aircraft orders have fallen and certain airlines have begun to delay or cancel scheduled deliveries of new aircraft 
we expect new commercial aircraft deliveries to decline approximately in versus  based upon the most recent delivery forecasts provided by boeing and airbus 
notwithstanding this reduction  the approximately deliveries forecast for would represent the fifth highest number of deliveries in any of the prior ten years 
in addition to deferring new aircraft purchases  many airlines elected to defer certain optional maintenance and refurbishment activities in order to minimize total cash outlays in response to weaker air travel demand 
a significant portion of maintenance  repair and overhaul activity required on commercial aircraft is mandated by government regulation that limits the total time or number of flights that may elapse between scheduled maintenance  repair or overhaul events 
as a result  although short term deferrals are possible  maintenance  repair and overhaul activity is ultimately required to continue to operate the aircraft in revenue producing service 
therefore  over the intermediate and long term  trends in the maintenance  repair and overhaul market are closely related to the size and utilization level of the worldwide aircraft fleet  as reflected by the number of available seat miles  commonly referred to as asms  flown 
according to the airline monitor  since worldwide asms have grown every year but and  it projects  including this slight decline in  the airline monitor projects worldwide asms to grow at a compound rate of approximately per annum from through  compared to an historical compound growth rate of per annum from through the negative effects of the events of september  on the commercial aviation market have been somewhat offset by increased demand for new and replacement military equipment in support of stronger national defense and a renewed emphasis on homeland security 
in response to the terrorist attacks  the us congress passed a billion emergency supplemental appropriation bill  approximately half of which we expect to be spent on defense 
this was followed by the submission by the president of a fiscal us department of defense  commonly referred to as dod  budget that reflected the highest modernization funding increase since operation desert storm 
we expect that future dod budgets will continue to reflect stronger support for increased funding for both force readiness and new systems production 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  aviation segment net sales 
net sales for our aviation segment increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
this growth in net sales is due to our increased participation in the expanding regional jet market  namely the canadair rj programs  growth of participation in airbus programs  primarily the a  a and a programs and certain military programs  most significantly the boeing c and f a programs 
revenue growth was also helped by the positive impact of license agreements and product lines obtained in fiscal and from the acquisition of certain assets of emco fluid systems  inc  now doing business as efs aerospace  inc  or efs 
increases in certain boeing program deliveries  namely the new generation and  added to the growth of net sales in fiscal over the prior year period offset by declines in other programs  most notably the northrop grumman e c

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for our aviation segment decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to the adoption of sfas sfas provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized 
in accordance with sfas  we stopped amortizing goodwill effective april  had sfas been effective april   depreciation and amortization would have increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in amortization related to our purchase of certain licenses and a product line that we acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal and an increase in depreciation due to our capital expenditure program 
operating income 
operating income for our aviation segment increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period

the remaining net increase in operating income over the prior year period of approximately million resulted from the increase in revenues and gross profit  most notably from the programs discussed above as well as the acquisition of efs  offset by increases in selling  general and administrative expenses from our aviation segment as a whole 
metals segment net sales

our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal net income 
net income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
the increase in net income was primarily attributable to growth in our aviation segment  the acquisition of efs  the adoption of sfas in fiscal and decrease in interest expense offset by the special charge

as a result of the realignment  we recorded a pre tax charge of million  primarily related to severance for three employees 
interest expense and other 
interest expense and other increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to significantly higher debt levels associated with the acquisition of the acquired companies  the cash portions of which were financed by incremental borrowings under our revolving credit facility  as well as a slightly higher rate on these borrowings 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal net income 
net income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in fiscal net income was primarily attributable to incremental net income from the acquired companies  the overall growth in our other operating locations and new product lines  partially offset by increased interest expense due to increased debt levels associated with the aquisition of the acquired companies 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities for the year ended march  we used approximately million in investing activities  and used million in financing activities for the year ended march  in march  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock for per share through an underwritten public offering 
in april  the underwriters exercised the over allotment option for an additional  shares of our common stock 
the net proceeds from these sales of million were used to repay long term debt 
on february   we amended our revolving credit facility with our lenders to amend certain terms and add the ability to borrow up to million at an overnight interest rate in addition to borrowings at libor or prime 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at either libor plus between and or the prime rate  or the federal funds rate plus  if greater  or an overnight interest rate at our option and expires on june  the variation in the interest rate is based upon our ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  we are required to pay a commitment fee of between and on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility 
we may allocate up to million of our available revolving credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit 
as of march   approximately million was available under our revolving credit facility 
on march   an aggregate amount of approximately million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility  million of which was accruing interest at libor plus applicable basis points totaling per annum  which includes the effects of an interest rate swap  and million of which was accruing interest at an overnight interest rate of 
amounts repaid under our revolving credit facility may be re borrowed 
on august   we entered into a loan agreement with the illinois development finance authority related to the illinois development finance authority economic development bonds  series of the million of proceeds of these bonds were used to fund the purchase of a new electrogalvanizing production line for our subsidiary  triwestern metals 
these bonds are due to mature on august  and are secured by the equipment 
these bonds bear interest at a variable rate based on libor  which at march  was 
capital expenditures were approximately million for the year ended march   primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment for our aviation segment 
we funded these expenditures through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million for our fiscal year ending march  the expenditures are expected to be used mainly to expand capacity at several facilities 
in august  we acquired efs 
the cash portion of the purchase price paid at closing for this acquisition of approximately million was funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in connection with this acquisition  we assumed million of seller financing  which accrues interest at and million of other debt 
between august and october  we retired substantially all of the then outstanding balance of the other debt of efs 
these payments were funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in april  we acquired certain assets of ozone industries  inc for million 
this purchase was funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on december   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock  subject to market conditions 
repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions  block purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at prevailing prices 
no time limit has been set for completion of this program 
in september  we repurchased a total of  shares at an average share price of 
from the inception of the program through march   we have repurchased a total of  shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
our expected future cash flows for the next five years for long term debt  leases and other obligations are as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt      capital lease obligations    operating leases      other long term obligations  total      included in our balance sheet at march  includes interest component 
we believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations 
however  we have a stated policy to grow through acquisitions 
currently  we are evaluating various acquisition opportunities and pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates 
in the event that more than one of these transactions are successfully consummated  the availability under our revolving credit facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed 
there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
critical accounting policies accounting policies that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and operating results pertain to the valuation of accounts receivable  inventory  goodwill and revenue recognition 
in developing estimates we consider available information and use judgment 
we adopted sfas  goodwill and intangible assets  as of april  sfas provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized 
as such  we did not record goodwill amortization in fiscal  which would have been approximately million 
rather  we performed an impairment test on the net carrying value as of april   the initial test  and february   the annual test  as required by sfas we were not required to record an impairment charge based on these tests 
the test required estimates  assumptions and judgments and results could be materially different if different estimates  assumptions and judgments had been used 
market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our operating results and the cash flow available after debt service to fund operations and expansion and  if permitted to do so under certain of our debt arrangements  including our revolving credit facility  to pay dividends on our common stock 
we manage our exposure to changes in interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
we have entered into a two year interest rate swap to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments to hedge against interest rate changes for million of our outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility 
we utilize derivatives to hedge actual exposure and do not speculate using derivatives 
the net effect of the spread between the floating rate  which is based upon day libor  and the fixed rate  on our earnings for the year ended march   was approximately million 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and should be read in conjunction with note of our consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents principal cash flows and the related interest rates by year of maturity 
fixed interest rates disclosed represent the weighted average rate as of march  variable interest rates disclosed fluctuate with the libor  federal funds rates and other weekly rates and represent the weighted average rate at march  expected years of maturity thereafter total fixed rate cash flows in thousands     weighted average interest rate variable rate cash flows in thousands   weighted average interest rate forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of relating to our future operations and prospects  including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate  and our beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information 
such statements are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this document  words like may  might  will  expect  anticipate  believe  potential  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from management s current expectations 
for example  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required or that additional capital  if required  will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us 
in addition to these factors  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses  general economic conditions affecting our business segments  dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers as well as competitive factors relating to the aviation and metals industries
