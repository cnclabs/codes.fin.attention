item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company s revenue consists primarily of interest income generated from bond collateral mortgage loans and its cash and investment balances collectively  earning assets  prepayment penalty income  income generated by equity in income of american residential holdings  inc and management fees 
the company has funded its acquisitions of earning assets with both its equity capital and with borrowings 
for that portion of the company s earning assets funded with equity capital equity funded lending  net interest income is derived from the average yield on earning assets 
due to the adjustable rate nature of the majority of its earning assets  the company expects that income from this source will tend to increase as interest rates rise and will tend to decrease as interest rates fall 
for that portion of the company s earning assets funded with borrowings spread lending  the resulting net interest income is a function of the volume of spread lending and the difference between the company s average yield on earning assets and the cost of borrowed funds 
yields on adjustable rate loans generally adjust every six months based on a contractual margin over the month libor index  however contractual minimum rates floors on these loans preclude any reduction below the initial start rate 
the majority of borrowings adjust monthly to a spread of approximately over the one month libor rate 
net interest spread from spread lending will generally decrease following an increase in short term interest rates due to increases in borrowing costs but a lag in adjustments to the earning asset yields 
net interest spread income from spread lending will generally increase following a fall in short term interest rates due to decreases in borrowing costs and a lag in downward adjustments to  and floors limiting  the earning asset yields 
historically  the company s primary expenses  beside its borrowing costs  are amortization of loan purchase premiums  provision for loan losses  losses on sale of real estate owned reo  and management and administrative expenses 
provision for loan losses represent the company s best estimate of expenses related to loan defaults 
losses on the sale of reo represent a shortfall between sale proceeds and the net carrying amount of the property 
the carrying value does included a reduction credit provision to reflect an estimate of net proceeds at time of sale 
premiums are amortized using the interest method over their estimated lives 
administrative costs are generally based on the size of the earning asset portfolio 
the operating results in were dominated by the following a strategic decision to avoid mortgage asset acquisitions  resulting in a continual decline in the size of the mortgage loan portfolio and the absolute level of interest spread  offset by a widening of the spread earned on the portfolio due to significant declines in the company s borrowing rates  proportionately higher charges for premium amortization and credit allowances on the mortgage asset portfolio associated with continued high prepayments and normal seasoning of the portfolio  respectively 
termination of the management agreement and amendment of the purchase agreement resulted in an expense of million  including million of associated transaction expenses  and higher general and administrative expenses in the th quarter of due to termination of the management agreement and personnel additions associated with the launch of the company s mortgage banking subsidiary  amnet 
one of the company s primary objectives is to diversify the income stream 
the company intends to phase out its spread lending activity and utilize all available capital for mortgage banking activities 
as a result  the company began loan origination activity in november of through its taxable reit subsidiary  amnet 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s strategy will be successful or that the company will restore its profitability or be able to sustain profits in the future 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
our significant accounting policies and practices are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  in that they require management s most subjective judgments  to form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to the company 
these critical accounting policies include the following allowance for loan losses the company s policy with respect to the allowance for loan losses is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at an amount which it believes is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in the bond collateral mortgage loans portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on such factors as the company s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that have occurred but are not yet known that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of underlying collateral  and economic conditions 
as management utilizes information currently available to evaluate the allowance for loan losses  the allowance for loan losses is subjective and may be adjusted in the future depending on changes in economic conditions or other factors 
during the time the company holds bond collateral mortgage loans  it is subject to credit risks  including risks of borrower defaults  bankruptcies and special hazard losses that are not covered by standard hazard insurance such as those occurring from earthquakes or floods 
all of our bond collateral mortgage loans were made to borrowers who do not qualify for loans from conventional mortgage lenders  which may lead to higher delinquency rates and or credit losses for and thus require high loan loss allowances 
although management has established an allowance for loan losses that it considers adequate  there can be no assurance that the established allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to offset losses on bond collateral mortgage loans in the future 
amortization of premiums on bond collateral  mortgage loans the portfolio of bond collateral mortgage loans  was acquired on a servicing released basis  meaning we acquired both the mortgage loans and the rights to service them 
this strategy required us to pay a higher purchase price or premium for the mortgages 
premiums are amortized to income using the interest method  generally over their estimated lives considering anticipated prepayments 
if these mortgage loans prepay faster than originally projected  gaap requires the company to write down the remaining capitalized premium amounts at a faster speed than was originally projected  which would decrease our current net interest income 
mortgage prepayments generally increase on our adjustable rate mortgages when fixed mortgage interest rates fall below the then current interest rates on outstanding adjustable rate mortgage loans 
prepayments on bond collateral mortgage loans are also affected by the terms and credit grades of the loans  conditions in the housing and financial markets and general economic conditions 
prepayments on fixed rate mortgages will also decrease our net interest income when interest rates are declining 
the company has sought to minimize the effects on operations caused by faster than anticipated prepayment rates by lowering premiums paid to acquire mortgage loans and by purchasing mortgage loans with prepayment penalties 
those penalties typically expire two to five years from origination 
as of december   approximately of bond collateral mortgage loans had active prepayment penalty features 
most of the intermediate adjustable rate mortgages in the cmo fasit   a and segments of the portfolio have reached their first contractual interest rate adjustment increase and many prepayment penalties on these loans have expired  resulting in a higher probability of refinancing and principal prepayments 
the company anticipates that prepayment rates on the segment of loans will increase as these predominately adjustable rate loans reach their initial adjustments 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain lower prepayment rates or that prepayment rates will not increase 
the company s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if prepayment levels increase significantly 
derivative and hedging activities prior to  the company used interest rate cap agreements cap agreements for interest rate risk protection on bond collateral 
the cap agreements were purchased primarily to reduce the company s gap risk the timing difference or mis match between the repricing of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
on january   the company adopted sfas prior to adoption of sfas  we had designated the cap agreements as hedges to assure that we maintained a positive gap between the cost of borrowing and the yield on our bond collateral mortgage loans bond collateral mortgage loanportfolio and  accordingly  the cost of the cap agreements was amortized over the life of the cap agreements using the straight line method 
upon adoption of sfas  we determined that our cap agreements did not meet the hedging requirements of sfas and  accordingly  we recorded transition amounts associated with establishing the fair values of the cap agreements on the balance sheet as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  which increased our net loss by million 
the mortgage banking business of american mortgage network  inc amnet  which began in the fourth quarter of  is subject to the risk of rising mortgage interest rates between the time it commits to extend credit at fixed rates and the time it sells the mortgage loans 
to mitigate this risk  amnet uses puts and calls on financial instruments treasury notes  treasury bonds  and eurodollars of varying terms  forward commitments to sell mortgage loans and commitments to extend credit at fixed rates 
the nature and quantity of these hedging transactions are determined based on various factors  including market conditions and the expected volume of mortgage loan originations 
amnet s derivative financial activities did not meet the hedging criteria under sfas and  accordingly  are accounted for in the accompanying financial statements as trading activities 
to the extent that our estimates regarding various factors  including the expected volume of mortgage loan originations  differ from actual results  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
results of operations compared to for the years ended december  and  the company generated a net loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
net loss per share of common stock was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss in was due to several events which had large impacts 
these events include purchase of the management contract for million  adoption of sfas which resulted in a write down of cap agreements for approximately million  transaction fees related to the management contract buyout of approximately million and start up operating losses of the amnet mortgage loan origination business of approximately million 
the company s decision to avoid portfolio acquisitions throughout and resulted in a continued decline in the size of bond collateral mortgage loan portfolio 
this decline also resulted in a decrease in interest income and operating cash flow 
the net loss in was in a large part due to an impairment loss on retained interest in a securitization and spread compression 
spread compression in was a result of a basis point increase in borrowing rates from in december of to in december of  which was not offset by a corresponding increase in asset yields 
the impairment loss was determined by comparing discounted future cash flows of the retained interest and comparing that amount to that recorded on the balance sheet 
the discounted future cash flows had been negatively impacted by higher than forecasted prepayment activity 
premium amortization expense represents the amortization of purchase premiums paid for bond collateral mortgage loans acquired in excess of the par value of the loans 
premium amortization expense was approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the following table represents constant repayment rates cpr s cpr rates life time six months three months december  bond collateral cmo fasit cmo cmo cmo remic a cmo december  bond collateral cmo fasit cmo cmo cmo remic a cmo n a at december   unamortized premiums as a percentage of the remaining principal amount of bond collateral mortgage loans were  as compared to at december  the chart below provides a breakdown of prepayments coverage and the weighted average months remaining until the next interest rate adjustment for each segment of the bond collateral mortgage loan portfolio as of december  principal balance percentage of loans with prepayment penalties weighted average months remaining on prepayment coverage weighted average months until next interest rate adjustment dollars in thousands bond collateral  mortgage loans cmo fasit  com  cmo  cmo remic a  cmo  prepayment coverage is the number of months remaining before the prepayment clause in the mortgage loan contracts expire and borrowers may prepay the loan without prepayment penalty charges 
most of the intermediate adjustable rate mortgages in the cmo fasit   a and segments of the bond collateral mortgage loans portfolio have reached their first contractual interest rate adjustment increase and prepayment penalties clauses on the underlying pool of loans have expired or declined  resulting in a higher probability of refinancing and principal prepayments 
the company anticipates that prepayment rates on the segment of the bond collateral mortgage loans will increase as these predominately adjustable rate loans reach their next adjustments or when prepayment penalty clauses expire 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain lower prepayment rates or that prepayment rates will not increase 
the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if prepayment levels increase significantly 
during  other operating income decreased approximately million over the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease of approximately thousand in prepayment penalty income 
equity in income from american residential holdings  inc holdings a taxable affiliate added to the decrease in other operating income by approximately thousand as holdings share of cmo income decreases  also due to prepayments 
for the year ended december   other expenses increased approximately million over the year ended december  during the company incurred the cost to buy out the management contract of million  increased transaction fees to complete the buy out of approximately million and operating losses to start loan origination activity of approximately million 
the million payment to buy out the management contract was treated as a non recurring expense as it has no future economic benefit 
increased other expenses were partially offset by no impairment losses in compared to approximately million in  reduced losses on sale of real estate owned by approximately thousand and a reduction of management fees by approximately million 
the company held mortgage assets of approximately million as of december   comprised mainly of mortgage loans held as bond collateral 
subsidiaries of the company  american residential eagle and american residential eagle  hold these assets  of which approximately million and million  respectively  is pledged as collateral for long term debt bonds 
this compares to million as of december  this reduction is a result of prepayments due to favorable refinance rates and the company not replacing these assets 
as previously discussed  the company is deploying assets to fund amnet activities 
results of operations compared to for the years ended december  and december  the company generated a net loss of approximately and million  respectively 
net loss per share of common stock was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss in was in a large part due to an impairment loss on retained interest in a securitization and spread compression 
spread compression in  was a result of a basis point increase in borrowing rates from in december of to in december of  which was not offset by a corresponding increase in asset yields 
the company s decision to not purchase new assets during the year has resulted in a decline in the portfolio balance 
a decline in the size of the portfolio has reduced the relative level of interest income although interest income increased in  there would have been a larger increase if asset yields had increased and operating cash flow available to fund new portfolio asset acquisitions 
the net loss in was directly attributable to the write down of premium on bond collateral mortgage loans in the amount of approximately million 
this other than temporary impairment was caused by a significant increase in prepayments during the year 
see table below for prepayment rates 
these loans were purchased in and early when non conforming loans were selling significantly above par 
the growth in mortgage asset interest income of million  and the decrease in net interest spread of million between the years ended december   and  were primarily due to a higher average portfolio 
net interest spread decreased as a result of higher average borrowing interest expense associated with increased borrowing costs not matched by increased mortgage asset yields 
net interest income increased million from the prior period ended december  this was primarily due to a premium write down expense of million taken during the period ending december  premium amortization expense represents the amortization of purchase premiums paid for bond collateral mortgage loans acquired in excess of the par value of the loans 
premium amortization expense was approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  lower premium amortization expense is due to a decrease in amortization expense on the fasit portfolio offset by increased amortization on the and a portfolios 
additionally  increased levels of prepayments in the fourth quarter of on the cmo fasit segment of bond collateral mortgage loans lead to a premium write down of million in the fourth quarter of the following chart represents constant repayment rates cprs cpr rates life time six months three months december  bond collateral cmo fasit com cmo cmo remic a cmo n a cpr rates life time six months three months december  bond collateral cmo fasit com cmo cmo remic a at december   unamortized premiums as a percentage of the remaining principal amount of bond collateral mortgage loans were  as compared to at december  nonaccrual loans increased from million at december  to million at december  or million 
the company s allowances for loan losses increased to million from million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
management believes the allowances for loan losses is adequate based on the company s analysis of the collateral for the loans 
during  other operating income increased approximately thousand over the year ended december  primarily due to an increase of approximately thousand in equity in income from american residential holdings  inc a taxable affiliate partially offset by a decrease in prepayment penalty income of approximately thousand 
for the year ended december   other expenses increased approximately million over the year ended december  during the loss on the sale of real estate owned increased by thousand and management fees increased approximately thousand as a result of the company s mortgage loans having a higher average balance in than throughout mortgage loan balances declined  but the average mortgage loan balance in was higher than in general and administrative expenses increased approximately thousand from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of adding employees  administration of reo and pursuing loan repurchases by loan sellers  an increase in computer software amortization and excise taxes 
professional fees increased by thousand from the year ended december  to the year ended december  primarily as a result of fees for legal work to expand state licensing 
the company held mortgage assets of approximately million as of december   comprised mainly of mortgage loans held as bond collateral 
this compares to billion as of december  comprised of mortgage loans held for investment  net pledged  of approximately million and bond collateral of approximately billion 
liquidity and capital resources general during the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
the difference between net cash provided by operating activities and the net loss of approximately million was primarily the result of premium amortization  provision for loan losses  losses on loan sales  a decrease in over collateralization accounts  proceeds from sale of mortgage loans held for sale  offset by mortgage loan originations 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
the difference between net cash provided by operating activities and the net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  was primarily the result of premium amortization  a decrease in accrued interest receivable  and an impairment loss on retained interest in and provision for loan losses 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december   was approximately million 
net cash was positively impacted by principal payments on bond collateral mortgage loans of approximately and proceeds from the sale of real estate owned of approximately million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december   was approximately million 
net cash was positively impacted by principal payments on bond collateral mortgage loans of approximately million  the sale of mortgage loans held for investment of approximately million  and proceeds from the sale of real estate owned of approximately million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was approximately million 
major components of net cash used include payments on long term debt of approximately million  payment of dividends of approximately million and repurchase of outstanding shares of approximately thousand 
these cash uses were partially offset by the increase in net borrowings from short term debt of approximately million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was approximately million 
major components of net cash used include payments on long term debt of approximately million  decrease in short term debt of approximately million and payment of dividends of approximately million 
these cash uses were partially offset by the issuance of cmo bonds of approximately million 
the financial condition of the company can be affected by turmoil in world markets as well as domestic liquidity problems 
as stated earlier  the company intends to seek new financing sources as the need arises 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure new short or long term financing or that financing will be available on favorable terms 
on a go forward basis  the liquidity of the company will be significantly impacted by the mortgage banking activity that began in late specifically  the company expects to originate million to million per month of new mortgage loans and fund these originations with equity capital and warehouse facility borrowings 
the company will additionally engage in hedging transactions that require cash investment and may be subject to potential capital calls to maintain or adjust hedged positions 
furthermore  there will be significantly greater general and administrative costs associated with the operations of amnet and the company expects amnet to generate operating losses until the third quarter of the company intends to use its cash reserves  borrowings under the warehouse facilities and the subordinated debt facility and cash flow generated by the mortgage asset portfolio as well as cash flow generated from the origination and sale of mortgage loans to fund the operations of amnet 
the company is dependent on significant levels of warehouse financing to execute its mortgage banking strategy  and has limited cash reserves 
see business risk factors in item short term debt as of december   short term debt consists of a revolving credit line warehouse facility used to fund the company s lending activities 
as of december   mortgage loans held for sale were pledged as collateral for the warehouse facility 
the warehouse facility consists of borrowings of million with a financial institution for a maximum amount of million  maturing on november   secured by mortgage loans held for sale  generally bearing interest at libor plus spread at december  
the weighted average interest rate was in and the facility fee is on the aggregate committed amount of the warehouse facility 
the warehouse facility is repaid as principal payments on mortgage loans are received  or as the mortgage loans are sold 
the agreement governing this facility contains a number of covenants  including covenants based on tangible net worth  cash flows  net income  and liquidity of the company 
in march  the warehouse facility was increased to million 
additionally on march   the company obtained a million warehouse facility from ubs warburg real estate securities 
by prior agreement  upon securing the ubs warburg facility  the original warehouse facility was decreased to million and is scheduled to further decreased to million on may  total warehouse borrowing capacity was million on march   and is scheduled to decrease to million on may  the company s short term sources of liquidity also include a million senior subordinated secured revolving loan agreement  which bears interest at and matures in december  subject to provisions for extension of two additional one year periods at the company s option 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december  long term debt non recourse mortgage backed notes the company s long term debt consists of non recourse mortgage backed notes  which are principally secured by bond collateral  mortgage loans  and bond collateral  real estate owned 
obligations under the mortgage back notes are payable solely from the proceeds from the bond collateral and are otherwise non recourse to the company 
the maturities of the mortgage backed notes are directly affected by the rate of principal repayments on the related bond collateral 
the notes are also subject to redemption according to the specific terms of the indentures pursuant to which they were issued 
as a result  the actual maturities are likely to occur earlier than the stated maturities

until all required documentation is provided and underwritten  there is no credit risk to the company 
there is no interest rate risk until a rate commitment is extended by the company to the borrower 
some of these commitments will ultimately be denied by the company or declined by the borrower  and therefore  the commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

quantitative disclosures about market risk a primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk 
the company attempts to manage this risk by striving to balance its mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan sale business 
to a lesser degree the company also manages the interest rate risk on it portfolio business between interest earned on bond collateral mortgage assets and interest paid on long term debt collaterized by mortgage assets 
the company has performed various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on its interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses presume an instantaneous parallel shift of the yield curve 
various techniques are employed to value the underlying financial instruments and rely upon a number of critical assumptions 
the scenarios presented are illustrative 
actual experience may differ materially from the estimated amounts presented for each scenario 
to the extent that yield curve shifts are non parallel and to the extent that actual variations in significant assumptions differ from those applied for purposes of the valuations  the resultant valuations can also be expected to vary 
such variances may prove material
