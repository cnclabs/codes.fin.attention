item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
introduction we were formed in june to succeed to the business operations of companies previously acquired by bwi  as described below 
from our formation through our initial public offering  or ipo  on october   we operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of bwi  and procured a number of services from  and engaged in a number of financial and other transactions with  bwi 
after the ipo  we continued to be controlled by bwi  but operated on a stand alone basis 
on december   bwi distributed to the holders of bwi common stock on december  all of the shares of our class a common stock owned by bwi  making priority healthcare corporation a stand alone public company 
accordingly  since the ipo we have incurred and will continue to incur incremental recurring legal  audit  risk management and administrative costs related to operating as a stand alone entity that we did not experience as a wholly owned subsidiary of bwi 
the financial information included in this annual report on form k prior to is not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows as a stand alone public company 
we provide specialty pharmaceuticals and related medical supplies  as well as disease treatment services  to patients  office based physicians  outpatient renal dialysis centers and homecare markets 
our operations are derived from the acquisition by bwi of substantially all of the assets of charise charles  a specialty wholesale distributor of oncology and renal care biopharmaceuticals  in february and of prn  a specialty wholesale distributor of renal care supplies and dialysis equipment  in october we subsequently acquired c  a specialty distributor of acute dialysis products  in october and iv  inc  iv one services  inc 
and national pharmacy providers  inc  three related companies that provided specialty pharmacy and related healthcare services  in january subsequent to that  we acquired substantially all of the assets of grove way pharmacy  a vaccine and injectable drug distributor  in august  pharmacy plus  ltd  a specialty pharmacy  in april  monitors unlimited  inc  a distributor in the oral surgery market  in september  three related companies doing business as freedom drug  the nation s leading infertility specialty pharmacy  in january  physicians formulary international  inc  a distributor in the outpatient surgery center market  in march  and chesapeake infusion llc  doing business as infurx  a specialty pharmacy  in october these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired companies are included in our financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
as a result  period to period comparisons of financial position and results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
the operations of charise charles  prn  c  grove way pharmacy  monitors unlimited and physicians formulary indirectly provide products to patients through oncology practices  renal dialysis centers and other healthcare providers 
effective december   iv one services  inc and national pharmacy providers  inc were merged into iv  inc 
and the name of the corporation was changed to priority healthcare pharmacy  inc the operations of priority healthcare pharmacy  inc  pharmacy plus  freedom drug and infurx provide products and services directly to patients 
historically  the operations that provide products and services directly to patients have generated substantially higher margins than the operations that indirectly provide products to patients 
we typically are reimbursed for products and services provided directly to patients by third party payors  primarily private insurers and managed care organizations 
sales derived from agreements with managed care organizations generally are made pursuant to established rates negotiated periodically 
we typically are reimbursed for products provided indirectly to patients by oncology practices  renal dialysis centers and other healthcare providers and pricing is negotiated directly with the providers 
in june  we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with advancepcs to provide specialty pharmacy services to advancepcs clients and their members 
the joint venture is named advancepriority specialtyrx 
advancepcs owns of the venture and we own 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition revenues are recognized when products are shipped to unaffiliated customers with appropriate provisions recorded for estimated discounts and contractual allowances 
discounts and contractual allowances are estimated based on historical collections 
any differences between our estimates and actual collections are reflected in operations in the year payment is received 
receivables receivables are presented net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
receivables include trade and patient account receivables and the current portion of trade receivables that have been converted to note receivables 
we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances after considering the age of each outstanding receivable and the collection history 
results of operations compared to net sales

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in to from in this decrease was primarily attributed to changing payor reimbursement patterns  as the use of prescription benefit management pbm plans increased and reimbursement from major medical plans for certain prescribed drugs decreased  and the change in sales mix  as lower margin products experienced increased sales 
competition continues to exert pressure on margins 
selling  general and administrative expense

interest income 
interest income  decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of

in  the interest income was primarily related to amounts earned by investing cash and funds received from operations  the secondary public offering of our class b common stock and stock option exercises in overnight repurchase agreements with major financial institutions and in marketable securities 
in  interest income of million was primarily related to amounts earned by investing cash and funds received from the secondary public offering of our class b common stock in overnight repurchase agreements with major financial institutions and in marketable securities  and interest income of  was related to loaning funds to bwi 
the interest income on the loans to bwi was calculated by applying bwi s average incremental borrowing rate  which was for  to the average outstanding balances 
during the average outstanding loans to bwi were million 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in and represented and  respectively  of earnings before taxes 
during  we implemented selected tax strategies which reduced our effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements have been to fund working capital needs to support internal growth  for acquisitions and for capital expenditures 
our principal working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable 
management controls inventory levels in order to minimize carrying costs and maximize purchasing opportunities 
we sell inventory to our customers on various payment terms 
this requires significant working capital to finance inventory purchases and entails accounts receivable exposure in the event any of our major customers encounter financial difficulties 
although we monitor closely the creditworthiness of our major customers  there can be no assurance that we will not incur some collection loss on major customer accounts receivable in the future 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million and working capital of million at december  we believe that the cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  working capital and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least two years 
net cash provided by operating activities 
our operations generated million in cash during receivables  net of acquisitions  increased million  primarily to support the increase in sales and the extension of credit terms to meet competitive conditions 
finished goods inventory  net of acquisitions  increased million  primarily due to new product introductions  to support the increase in sales and to take advantage of some purchasing opportunities 
the million increase in accounts payable  net of acquisitions  partially reduced the cash requirements for receivables and finished goods inventory  this increase was attributable to the increase in inventory  the timing of payments and the credit terms negotiated with vendors 
other current assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  increased cash by million  primarily due to income taxes payable 
we anticipate that our operations may require cash to fund our growth 
during  d a totaled million  provision for doubtful accounts totaled million and impairment of investment totaled million 
we also increased cash by million due to the tax benefit related to stock option exercises during net cash used by investing activities 
in  we purchased million of marketable securities in order to take advantage of higher interest rates related to longer term investments 
in  we purchased million of fixed assets  primarily pharmacy system software  internet software  computer hardware and software  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
the leasehold improvements related to relocating our infertility specialty pharmacy in massachusetts and our sales office in arizona 
we expect that capital expenditures during will be approximately million 
we anticipate that these expenditures will relate primarily to the purchase of pharmacy system software  computer hardware and software  telecommunications equipment and furniture and equipment 
in  other assets increased million due to a deposit we made with a major supplier to generate better pricing 
also during  we used million to purchase freedom drug  an infertility specialty pharmacy  physicians formulary  a national distributor of biopharmaceuticals specializing in the outpatient surgery center market  and infurx  a specialty pharmacy 
net cash provided by financing activities 
during  we received proceeds of million from stock option exercises and we purchased treasury stock for million 
we purchased the treasury stock because we thought it was an attractive investment 
we are authorized to purchase another  shares of treasury stock until july inflation our financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical costs and are not intended to reflect changes in the relative purchasing power of the dollar 
because of our ability to take advantage of forward purchasing opportunities  we believe that our gross profits generally increase as a result of manufacturers price increases in the products we distribute 
gross profits may decline if the rate of price increases by manufacturers declines 
generally  price increases are passed through to customers as we receive them and therefore they reduce the negative effect of inflation 
other non inventory cost increases  such as payroll  supplies and services  have been partially offset during the past three years by increased volume and productivity 
new accounting pronouncements in july the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangibles will be evaluated against this new criteria and may result in certain intangibles being subsumed into goodwill  or alternatively  amounts initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and recognized apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
under a nonamortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
the provisions of each statement which apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to june  were adopted by the company on december  we expect the adoption of these accounting standards will have the impact of reducing our amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense by approximately million annually commencing december   however  impairment reviews may result in future periodic write downs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of a decline in the market value of our investments in marketable debt securities as a result of potential changes in interest rates 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates on securities included in our portfolio  and given the short term maturities of all of our investments in interest sensitive securities  this hypothetical fair value was not materially different from the period end carrying value
