item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity our financial condition and liquidity  for current operations  depends on our cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our bank loan agreement 
our cash flow is influenced mainly by the prices we receive for our natural gas production  the demand for and the dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs and  to a lesser extent  the prices we receive for our oil production 
our loan agreement provides for a revolving credit facility  which terminates on may  followed by a three year term loan 
at december   we had borrowed million  which was percent of the amount available  as elected by us on october   and represented percent of the loan value of our assets as determined by our banks on october  most of our capital expenditures are discretionary and directed toward future growth 
our oil and natural gas operations 
natural gas comprises approximately percent of our total oil and natural gas reserves 
any appreciable change in natural gas prices has a significant affect on our revenues  cash flow and the value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
such price changes also influence the demand for our natural gas production  our drilling rigs since they are used mainly to drill natural gas wells and the amount we can charge for our contract drilling services 
based on our production  a 
per mcf change in what we are paid for our natural production would result in a corresponding  per month  annualized change in our pre tax cash flow 
our average natural gas price declined from a high of per mcf in january to per mcf in september an percent decrease before recovering to per mcf in december 
for the year  our average natural gas price was per mcf 
a per barrel change in our oil price would have a  per month  annualized change in our pre tax cash flow 
we received the highest average oil price for the year during february at per barrel 
for the balance of the year oil prices declined resulting in our lowest average oil price of per barrel in december 
our average oil price for the year was per barrel 
generally  prices and demand for domestic natural gas are influenced by weather conditions  supply imbalances and by world wide oil price levels 
domestic oil prices are primarily influenced by world oil market developments 
all of these factors are beyond our control and we can not predict nor measure their future influence on the prices we will receive 
because natural gas prices have such a significant affect on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves declines in these prices can result in a reduction of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
likewise  price declines can also adversely affect the semi annual determination of the amount available for us to borrow under our bank loan agreement since that determination is based mainly on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
such a reduction could limit our ability to carry out our planned capital projects 
hedging activities 
periodically we hedge the prices we will receive for a portion of our future natural gas and oil production 
we do so in an attempt to reduce the impact and uncertainty that price fluctuations have on our cash flow 
in the first quarter of  we entered into swap transactions to lock in a portion of our oil production at higher oil prices 
these transactions applied to approximately percent of our daily oil production covering the period from april  to july  and percent of our daily oil production for august and september of at prices ranging from to 
we entered into a collar contract covering approximately percent of our daily oil production from november  through february  the collar had a floor of per barrel and a ceiling of per barrel and we received per barrel for entering into the transaction 
during  the net effect of our oil hedging transactions for oil reduced our oil revenues by  we did not have any hedging transactions for natural gas in during the first quarter of  our oil hedging transaction yielded an increase in our oil revenues of  we entered into a natural gas collar contract for approximately percent of our june and july natural gas production at a floor price of and a ceiling price of 
we also entered into two natural gas collar contracts for approximately percent of our september through november natural gas production 
both contracts had a floor price of 
one contract had a ceiling price of and the other contract had a ceiling price of 
for the year our natural gas collar contracts added  to our natural gas revenues 
we did not have any hedging transactions outstanding at december  nor on february  contract drilling operations 
our drilling operations are subject to many factors that influence the number of rigs we have working at any one time as well as the costs and revenues associated with such work 
these factors include competition from other drilling contractors  the prevailing prices for natural gas and oil  the availability of labor to operate our rigs and our ability to supply the type of equipment required 
we have not encountered major difficulty in hiring and retaining rig crews  but such shortages have occurred periodically in the past 
if demand for drilling rigs was to increase rapidly in the future  shortages of experienced personnel would limit our ability to increase the number of rigs we could operate 
low oil and natural gas prices during most of the s and s reduced demand for domestic land contract drilling rigs 
however  in the last half of and throughout  as oil and natural gas prices increased  we experienced a substantial increase in demand for our rigs 
our average utilization of rigs percent in january increased to rigs percent in july before dropping to rigs percent in december our average utilization for the year was rigs percent 
as demand for our rigs increased during the year so did the dayrates we received 
our average dayrate in january was  and by september it had increased to  however  as demand began to decrease so did our rates and by december our average dayrate was  that rate has continued to fall into the first quarter of based on the average utilization rate we achieved in  a per day change in dayrates has a  per day  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
we anticipate that for the first half of the number of our rigs operating will range in the mid to high thirties and dayrates will continue to decline early in the first quarter before stabilizing 
utilization and dayrates for the last half of and beyond will depend mainly on the price of natural gas during the first half of and beyond 
even if demand increases in  we anticipate that competition will continue to influence our operations 
bank loan agreement 
on july   we signed a million bank loan agreement 
at our election the amount currently available for us to borrow is set at million 
although the current value of our assets would have allowed us to have access to the full million  we elected to set the loan commitment at million in order to reduce financing costs since we are charged a facility fee of 
of percent on the amount available but not borrowed 
each year on april and october our banks redetermine the loan value of our assets 
this value is primarily determined to be an amount equal to a percentage of the discounted future value of our oil and natural gas reserves  as determined by the banks 
in addition  an amount representing a part of the value of our drilling rig fleet  limited to million  is added to the loan value 
our loan agreement provides for a revolving credit facility which terminates on may  followed by a three year term loan 
borrowing under our loan agreement totaled million at december  and million on february  borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the chase manhattan bank  na prime rate prime rate or the london interbank offered rates libor rate plus to percent depending on the level of debt as a percentage of the total loan value 
subsequent to may   borrowings under the loan agreement bear interest at the prime rate or the libor rate plus to percent depending on the level of debt as a percentage of the total loan value 
in addition  the loan agreement allows us to select  at any time between the date of the agreement and days prior to the start of the term loan  a fixed rate for the amount outstanding under the credit facility 
our ability to select the fixed rate option is subject to a number of conditions  all of which are more fully set out in the loan agreement 
the interest rate on our bank debt was percent at december  and percent on february  at our election  any portion of our outstanding bank debt may be fixed at the libor rate  as adjusted depending on the level of our debt as a percentage of the amount available for us to borrow 
the libor rate may be fixed for periods of up to   or days with the remainder of our bank debt being subject to the prime rate 
during any libor rate funding period  we may not pay any part of the outstanding principal balance which is subject to the libor rate 
borrowings subject to the libor rate were million at december  and february  the loan agreement requires us to maintain consolidated net worth of at least million  a current ratio of not less than to  a ratio of long term debt  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to and a ratio of total liabilities  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to in addition  working capital provided by our operations  as defined in the loan agreement  cannot be less than million in any year 
we are prohibited from paying dividends other than stock dividends during any fiscal year in excess of percent of our consolidated net income from the preceding fiscal year and we can pay dividends only if working capital provided from our operations during the preceding year is equal to or greater than percent of current maturities of long term debt at the end of the preceding year 
we also cannot incur additional debt except in certain very limited exceptions and the creation or existence of mortgages or liens  other than those in the ordinary course of business  on any of our property is prohibited unless it is in favor of our banks 
shareholders equity  working capital and capital expenditures 
our shareholders equity at december  was million giving us a ratio of long term debt to total capitalization of percent 
net cash provided by operations in was million compared to million in we had working capital of million at december  our total capital expenditures were million  net in accounts payable  of which million was spent on our oil and natural gas operations  million was spent on our drilling segment and  was spent primarily on furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 
additional oil and gas information 
our decisions on whether we try to increase our oil and natural gas reserves through acquisitions or through drilling depends on the prevailing or anticipated market conditions  potential return on investment  future drilling potential and the availability of opportunities to obtain financing under the circumstances involved  all of which tend to provide us with a large degree of flexibility in determining when and if to incur such costs 
as a result of the high natural gas prices during the last half of and into the first half of  there were not many opportunities during to acquire producing properties at prices we consider attractive 
as a result we spent million on exploration and development drilling  million for undeveloped leasehold and only million for producing property acquisitions 
we drilled wells in as compared with wells in based on current prices  for  we plan to drill an estimated wells and have total capital expenditures of approximately million for exploration  development drilling and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties 
on march   we completed the acquisition  by merger  of questa oil and gas co 
questa under which questa became a wholly owned subsidiary of unit corporation 
in the merger  each of questa s outstanding shares of common stock excluding treasury shares was converted into 
shares of our common stock 
we issued approximately million shares as a result of this merger 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  all amounts prior to the merger were restated  unless otherwise noted  as if the companies had been combined during the periods presented 
additional drilling information 
while natural gas prices were high in early  we continued to add to our rig fleet 
in january  we purchased a horse power diesel electric rig with a  foot depth capacity for million 
this rig was working in our gulf coast region at december  in february  we purchased a  horse power  winterized mechanical rig  with a  foot depth capacity  for million 
this rig was under contract in our rocky mountain region on december  in may we acquired two diesel electric rigs with depth capacities of  and  feet  for million 
these two rigs are both working in our gulf coast region 
we also acquired a  foot depth capacity diesel electric rig 
this rig will  depending on industry conditions and additional capital requirements  be placed in service when conditions warrant 
the addition of these five rigs brings our fleet to  of which are currently capable of operating 
during  we spent million for new drilling rigs  drilling rig components and refurbishments of existing rigs  million for new drill pipe and collars and million for transportation equipment 
for we anticipate that we will spend approximately million on our drilling operations 
our contract drilling segment provides drilling services for our exploration and production segment 
the contracts for these services are issued under the same conditions and rates as the contracts that we are in with unrelated parties 
the profit received by our contract drilling segment of  and  in and  respectively  for this work was used to reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties rather than being included in our profits in current operations 
contractual commitments 
we have various contractual obligations at december   which are as follows payments due by period less contractual than after obligations total year years years years in thousands bank debt    hickman note    retirement agreement  gas purchaser prepay ment operating leases   total contractual obligations      see previous discussion in management discussion and analysis regarding bank debt 
on november   we acquired hickman drilling company pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger entered into by and between us  hickman drilling company and all of the holders of the outstanding capital stock of hickman drilling company 
as part of this acquisition  the former shareholders of hickman held  as of december   promissory notes in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of million see note of our consolidated financial statements 
these notes are payable in equal annual installments on january  and january  the notes bear interest at the chase prime rate  which at december  and february  was percent 
at february  the promissory notes outstanding totaled million 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million in additional employee benefit expenses for the present value of a separation agreement made in connection with the retirement of king kirchner from his position as chief executive officer 
the liability associated with this expense  including accrued interest  will be paid in  monthly payments starting in july and continuing through june see note of our consolidated financial statements 
due to a settlement agreement  which terminated at december   we have a liability of  at december   included in current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet  representing proceeds received from a natural gas purchaser as prepayment for natural gas 
the  is payable on june  we lease office space in tulsa  houston and woodward under the terms of operating leases expiring through january  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we also have the following commitments and contingencies that could create  increase or accelerate our liabilities amount of commitment expiration per period total amount committed less other or than after commitments accrued year years years years in thousands deferred compensation agreement  unknown unknown unknown unknown separation benefit agreement  unknown unknown unknown repurchase obliga tions unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown we provide a salary deferral plan which allows participants to defer the recognition of salary for income tax purposes until actual distribution of benefits  which occurs at either termination of employment  death or certain defined unforeseeable emergency hardships 
we recognize payroll expense and record a liability  included in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  at the time of deferral see note of our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted a separation benefit plan separation plan 
the separation plan allows eligible employees whose employment with us is involuntarily terminated or  in the case of an employee who has completed years of service  voluntarily or involuntarily terminated  to receive benefits equivalent to weeks salary for every whole year of service completed with unit up to a maximum of weeks 
to receive payments the recipient must waive any claims against us in exchange for receiving the separation benefits 
on october   we adopted a separation benefit plan for senior management senior plan 
the senior plan provides certain officers and key executives of unit with benefits generally equivalent to the separation plan 
the compensation committee of the board of directors has absolute discretion in the selection of the individuals covered in this plan see note of our consolidated financial statements 
we formed the unit oil and gas limited partnership and the energy income limited partnership along with private limited partnerships the partnerships with certain qualified employees  officers and directors from through  with a subsidiary of ours serving as general partner 
the partnerships were formed for the purpose of conducting oil and natural gas acquisition  drilling and development operations and serving as co general partner with us in any additional limited partnerships formed during that year 
the partnerships participated on a proportionate basis with us in most drilling operations and most producing property acquisitions commenced by us for our own account during the period from the formation of the partnership through december of each year 
these partnership agreements require  upon the election of a limited partner  that we repurchase the limited partner s interest at amounts to be determined by appraisal in the future 
such repurchases in any one year are limited to percent of the units outstanding 
we made repurchases of  and  in and  respectively  for such limited partners interests 
no repurchases were made in see note of our consolidated financial statements 
oil and natural gas limited partnerships 
we are the general partner for eighteen oil and natural gas partnerships which were formed privately and publicly 
the partnership s revenues and costs are shared in accordance with formulas prescribed in each limited partnership agreement 
the partnerships reimburse us for contract drilling  well supervision and general and administrative expense reimbursements 
related party transactions for contract drilling and well supervision fees are the related party s share of such costs 
these costs are billed on the same basis as billings to unrelated parties for similar services 
general and administrative reimbursements consist of direct general and administrative expense incurred on the related party s behalf as well as indirect expenses allocated to the related parties 
such allocations are based on the related party s level of activity and are considered by management to be reasonable 
during the  and  the total paid to us for all of these fees was   and  respectively 
our proportionate share of assets  liabilities and net income relating to the oil and natural gas partnerships is included in our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we owned a percent equity interest in a natural gas gathering and processing company 
our balance sheet investment and equity in the company totaled million at december  at december  and february   we were not guaranteeing any indebtedness of the gas gathering and processing company 
at december   one of our subsidiaries owned  shares of common stock and  warrants of shenandoah resources ltd  a canadian oil and natural gas exploration and production company 
the investment of  is part of other assets in our consolidated balance sheet and was written down by million during critical accounting policies 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties is limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling 
the ceiling is defined as the sum of the present value percent discount rate of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  based on period ending oil and natural gas prices  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized less related income tax 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low oil or natural gas prices  even if temporary  increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
based on oil and natural gas prices in effect on december  per mcf for natural gas and per barrel for oil  the unamortized cost of our domestic oil and natural gas properties did not exceed the ceiling of our proved oil and natural gas reserves 
natural gas pricing has been erratic since year end and any significant declines below year end prices used in the reserve evaluation would likely result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly reporting periods 
the value of our oil and natural gas reserves is used to determine the loan value under our loan agreement 
this value is affected by both price changes and the measurement of reserve volumes 
oil and natural gas reserves cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of oil and natural gas reserves require extensive judgments of our reservoir engineering data and are generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
indeed the uncertainties inherent in the disclosure are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we utilizes ryder scott company  independent petroleum consultants  to review our reserves as prepared by our reservoir engineers 
drilling equipment  transportation equipment and other property and equipment are carried at cost 
renewals and betterments are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed 
realization of the carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
assets are determined to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset including disposal value if any  is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if any asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
an estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
changes in such estimates could cause unit to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
under footage and turnkey contracts  we bear the risk of completion of the well  so revenues and expenses are recognized using the completed contract method 
the entire amount of a loss  if any  is recorded when the loss can be determined 
the costs of uncompleted drilling contracts include expenses incurred to date on footage or turnkey contracts  which are still in process at the end of the period  and are included in other current assets 
effects of inflation in the years prior to the last half of  the effects of inflation on our operations was minimal due to low inflation rates and moderate demand for contract drilling services 
however  starting in the last half of and throughout and the first three quarters of  as drilling rig dayrates and utilization increased  the impact of inflation increased as the availability of used equipment and third party services decreased 
due to industry wide demand for qualified labor  contract drilling labor costs increased substantially in the summer of and once again in the summer of how inflation will affect us in the future will depend on additional increases  if any  realized in our drilling rig rates and the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas 
if industry activity recovers and returns to levels achieved in early  shortages in support equipment such as drill pipe  third party services and qualified labor could occur resulting in additional corresponding increases in our material and labor costs 
these conditions may limit our ability to realize improvements in operating profits 
new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
subsequently amended by financial accounting standard no 
s and  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
this statement requires all derivatives to be recognized on the balance sheet and measured at fair value 
if a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  we are required to measure the effectiveness of the hedge  or the degree that the gain loss for the hedging instrument offsets the loss gain on the hedged item  at each reporting period 
the effective portion of the gain loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in other comprehensive income as a component of equity and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is required to be recognized in earnings immediately 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment under fas must be recorded at fair value with gains losses recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we periodically enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on oil and natural gas production 
such instruments include regulated natural gas and crude oil futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex and over the counter swaps and basic hedges with major energy derivative product specialists 
at december   we were not holding any natural gas or oil derivative contracts 
on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
for goodwill and intangible assets already recorded in the financial statements  fas ends the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets and subsequently requires  at least annually  that an impairment test be performed on such assets to determine whether the fair value has changed 
we expensed  annually for the amortization of goodwill  and the unamortized balance of goodwill is  at december  fas is effective for the fiscal years starting after december  january  for us 
we do not believe the future impact from the adoption of fas on our financial position or results of operation will be material 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  january  for us and establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets mainly plugging and abandonment costs for our depleted wells in the period in which the liability is incurred at the time the wells are drilled 
we have not yet determined the effect of the adoption of fas on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  january  for us 
this statement supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and amends accounting principles board opinion no 
for the accounting and reporting of discontinued operations  as it relates to long lived assets 
we do not believe the future impact from the adoption of fas on our financial position or results of operations will be material 
results of operations versus net income for was  compared with  for this increase was due to increases in the use of our drilling rigs  as well as  the dayrates we received for the use of the drilling rigs 
high natural gas prices in the last quarter of and the first quarter of increased the demand for our drilling rigs which in turn pushed contract drilling dayrates higher 
our oil and natural gas revenues decreased percent in when compared with the average natural gas prices we received in increased percent  but this increase was offset by a percent reduction in our natural gas production 
the average oil price we received dropped percent while oil production increased one percent between the comparative years 
we drilled gross wells net wells in  compared to gross wells net wells in in  revenues from our contract drilling operations increased by percent as the average number of our drilling rigs being used increased from in to in revenues per rig per day increased percent between the comparative years 
daywork revenues represented percent of our total drilling revenues in and percent in operating margins revenues less operating costs for our oil and natural gas operations were percent in and percent in this decrease resulted mainly from declines in production on older wells without corresponding declines in operating expenses 
total operating cost increased percent and was due mainly to the addition of new wells through development drilling and increases in ad valorem taxes  workover expenses and compression fees 
our contract drilling operating margins increased from percent in to percent in the additional operating margin was generally due to additional revenue received per day and an increase in the number of rigs being used 
our contract drilling operating cost per rig per day decreased in when compared with as increased usage reduced the impact of our fixed indirect drilling expenses 
total contract drilling operating costs were up percent in versus primarily due to increased utilization and increases in field labor cost 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent due to higher rig utilization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of our oil and natural gas properties increased percent due primarily to a million impairment of our investment in a company which has oil and natural gas properties located in canada and from a percent increase in the average dd a rate per mcfe to in from mcfe in general and administrative expenses increased percent 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million in additional employee benefit expenses for the present value of a separation agreement made in connection with the retirement of king kirchner from his position as chief executive officer 
the liability associated with this expense plus accrued interest will be paid in  monthly payments starting in july and continuing through june interest expense decreased percent as our average outstanding debt decreased percent during the average interest rate decreased from percent in to percent in versus net income for was  compared with  for this improvement was mainly due to increases in our natural gas and oil prices and production volumes 
higher oil and natural gas prices also elevated the demand for our drilling rigs  resulting in increased utilization of our rigs  dayrates and net income 
our oil and natural gas revenues increased percent in due to a percent and percent rise in the average prices we received for natural gas and oil  respectively 
for the year  natural gas production increased by percent and oil production increased by percent when compared to production grew as we drilled gross wells net wells in compared to gross wells net wells in natural gas production for the fourth quarter of exceeded s fourth quarter production by percent 
in  revenues from our contract drilling operations increased by percent as the average number of our drilling rigs being used increased from in to in revenues per rig per day increased percent between the comparative years 
the acquisition of the parker drilling rigs added rigs to our utilization rate in the fourth quarter of and rigs to our utilization at dayrates substantially higher than those achieved in our other marketing area 
our rigs  excluding those acquired from parker  added rigs to utilization and added an additional percent to their revenue per rig per day 
daywork revenues represented percent of our total drilling revenues in and percent in operating margins revenues less operating costs for our oil and natural gas operations were percent in and percent in this increase resulted primarily from the increase in the average oil and natural gas prices we received 
total operating costs between the comparative years increased percent due primarily to the percent increase in production taxes incurred as a result of higher revenues and to a lesser extent from the addition of new wells through development drilling 
our contract drilling operating margins increased from percent in to percent in the additional operating margin was generally due to additional revenue received per day and an increase in the number of rigs utilized 
our contract drilling operating cost per rig day increased in as total contract drilling operating costs were up percent in versus primarily due to increased utilization 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent due to the impact of higher depreciation per operating day associated with the newly acquired parker rigs and an overall increase in our rig utilization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of our oil and natural gas properties increased percent due to additional production volumes 
the average dd a rate per mcfe decreased percent to in general and administrative expenses increased percent as certain employee costs  outside contract services and office expenses increased due to the growth in both of our operating segments 
interest expense decreased percent as our average outstanding debt decreased percent during the average interest rate increased from percent in to percent in on may   our contract drilling office in moore  oklahoma was struck by a tornado destroying two buildings and damaging various vehicles and drilling equipment 
in may  we received  of insurance proceeds for the destroyed buildings  and  as a result  in the second quarter of  we recognized a gain of  recorded as part of other revenues 
during the first quarter of  we received the final insurance proceeds totaling  for the contents of the destroyed buildings  damaged equipment and clean up costs 
from these proceeds  we recognized a gain of  recorded as part of other revenues in the first quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk 
our major market risk exposure is in the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
the price we receive is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and market prices applicable to our natural gas production 
historically  prices we have received for our oil and natural gas production have been volatile and such volatility is expected to continue 
the price of natural gas also effects the demand for our rigs and the amount we can charge for the use of the rigs 
based on our production  a 
per mcf change in what we are paid for our natural gas production would result in a corresponding  per month  annualized change in our pre tax cash flow 
a per barrel change in our oil price would have a  per month  annualized change in our pre tax cash flow 
periodically we hedge the prices we will receive for a portion of our future natural gas and oil production 
we do so in an attempt to reduce the impact and uncertainty that price fluctuations have on our cash flow 
in the first quarter of  we entered into swap transactions to lock in a portion of our oil production at higher oil prices 
these transactions applied to approximately percent of our daily oil production covering the period from april  to july  and percent of our daily oil production for august and september of at prices ranging from to 
we entered into a collar contract covering approximately percent of our daily oil production from november  through february  the collar had a floor of per barrel and a ceiling of per barrel and we received per barrel for entering into the transaction 
during  the net effect of our oil hedging transactions for oil reduced our oil revenues by  we did not have any hedging transactions for natural gas in during the first quarter of  our oil hedging transaction yielded an increase in our oil revenues of  we entered into a natural gas collar contract for approximately percent of our june and july natural gas production at a floor price of and a ceiling price of 
we also entered into two natural gas collar contracts for approximately percent of our september through november natural gas production 
both contracts had a floor price of 
one contract had a ceiling price of and the other contract had a ceiling price of 
for the year our natural gas collar contracts added  to our natural gas revenues 
we did not have any hedging transactions outstanding at december  nor on february  interest rate risk 
our interest rate exposure relates to our long term debt  all of which bears interest at variable rates based on the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor rate 
at our election  borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan may be fixed at the libor rate for periods up to days 
historically  we have not utilized any financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage our exposure to increases in interest rates 
however  we may use such financial instruments in the future should our assessment of future interest rates warrant such use 
based on our average outstanding long term debt in  a one percent change in the floating rate would change our annual cash flow before income taxes by approximately
