from time to time  as used herein  the term company or vcampus shall mean vcampus corporation and its subsidiaries cognitive training associates  inc  a texas corporation  cooper associates  inc  an illinois corporation  d b a teletutor  htr  inc  a delaware corporation  and uol leasing  inc  a delaware corporation 
the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview in  the company s revenues were derived from five primary sources online tuition revenues  development revenues  product sales revenues  other service revenues  and instructor led training revenues 
in  the company completed its shift to focus completely on online training 
in   and  the company s online related businesses accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
online tuition revenues are generated primarily from online tuition derived from corporate  government  and higher education clients 
product sales revenues are derived from the sale of telecommunications related computer based training cbt courses that are delivered through traditional cbt format eg cd rom 
development revenues consist primarily of fees paid to the company for creating and developing new online courseware and web enabling existing courseware 
other service revenues consist primarily of monthly fees generated by the licensing and maintenance of the cybis courseware under contract with the us army 
instructor led training revenues are generated from on site and classroom training fees 
because the company has completed its transition to focus completely on its core online businesses  it does not expect to generate any significant instructor led training revenues in the foreseeable future 
during  the company changed its pricing model from a platform license fee for hosting services to an asp service fees and subscription model based on course usage commitments 
this pricing structure provides a lower cost of entry and generates a recurring revenue stream for vcampus 
while prior to licensing and support revenues have represented a substantial majority of the company s revenues  online related revenues currently comprise the vast majority of the company s total revenues and the company believes that online related revenues will continue to be the primary source of its revenues in the future 
acquisitions and divestitures since  the company has completed four acquisitions htr inc  cooper associates  inc d b a teletutor  ivy software  inc 
and cognitive training associates  inc each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the operating results of each acquired company are included in the company s financial statements from the effective date of each respective acquisition 
these acquisitions provided the company with clients and courseware content in non online format 
the company does not currently have an agreement  commitment or understanding with any other potential acquisition candidates 
in  the company began implementing its plan to divest its non online businesses  with the exception of teletutor 
this plan was completed in december through the closure of htr s remaining instructor led training sites in washington dc and rockville  md 
the company continues to follow a strategy of moving content and clients to an online training platform from the traditional classroom and cbt based training formerly sold through its former non online business 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the company s accounting policies which are significantly affected by management s estimates and assumptions are as follows revenue recognition the company derives its revenues from the following sources online tuition revenues  instructor led training revenues  product sales revenues  other service revenues  virtual campus software revenues  and development and other revenues 
revenue is recognized in accordance with either sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended  or statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
both sab and sop generally require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain sales  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
development and other revenues earned under courseware conversion contracts are recognized based on the ratio that total costs incurred to date bear to the total estimated costs of the contract 
management s estimates of total costs to complete contracts may be revised in future periods resulting in adjustments to revenue and profit recognized in the period the revisions are made 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of those customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles management assesses the recoverability of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when management determines that the carrying value of goodwill or other identifiable intangibles is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value can be estimated using a number of techniques including quoted market prices  valuations by third parties and discounted cash flow analysis 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  the company will cease amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles on january  in lieu of amortization  these assets will be subject to an annual impairment review 
the company may determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles have been impaired  resulting in an impairment charge in the period the review is completed 
as discussed in notes and  we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of potential loss  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability  if any  that could result from an unfavorable outcome of these proceedings 
accordingly  no amount has been accrued as of december  for these matters in the consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe these proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  or the effectiveness of our settlement or litigation strategies  related to these proceedings
