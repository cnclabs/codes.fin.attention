during the third quarter of  after a review of the goodwill balance originating from the purchase of cmt enterprises  inc in february  and the material changes that had occurred in the operation  it was determined that a write off of the entire goodwill balance was deemed appropriate 
the net amount of goodwill which was written off was approximately  which represented of sales for the year during  the total interest costs decreased  from due to lower outstanding debt balances 
lower average interest rates were also a contributing factor 
the average balance on total outstanding debt was  in  compared to  in the decrease in average debt balances resulted principally from the sale of preferred stock in the amount of  and the application of the proceeds of such sale to reduce debt 
as the company s growth continues  cash flow may require additional borrowed funds  which may cause further increases in interest expense 
during  interest costs including capitalized interest increased  as compared to primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances

liquidity the company considers the following as measures of liquidity and capital resources as of the dates indicated dollars in thousands 
working capital s current ratio ratio of working capital to total assets ratio of long term debt including current maturities to stockholders equity preferred stock is treated as equity for this calculation 
the company s primary needs for liquidity are to finance its inventories and revolving charge accounts and to invest in new stores  remodeling  fixtures and equipment 
cash flow from operations and proceeds from credit facilities represent the company s sources of liquidity 
management anticipates these sources of liquidity  combined with expected tax refund receipts  to be sufficient in the foreseeable future 
as a result of recently enacted tax legislation  the company will be able to carry back losses for an additional three years  resulting in expected federal tax refunds in of approximately million 
until received  the company will be able to borrow against of these tax receivables under its debt agreement which was amended subsequent to february  the company s capital expenditures budget for is approximately  to be used for the purchase of fixtures and equipment as well as store remodeling expenses 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for information about restrictions and covenants under the company s revolving line of credit 
seasonality the company s business is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of sales realized during the fall season third and fourth quarters of each year  which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons 
in light of this pattern  selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher as a percentage of sales during the spring seasons first and second quarters of each year 
inflation inflation affects the costs incurred by the company in its purchase of merchandise and in certain components of its selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company attempts to offset the effects of inflation through price increases and control of expenses  although the company s ability to increase prices is limited by competitive factors in its markets 
inflation has had no meaningful effect on sales or net earnings of the company 
critical accounting policies in  approximately of the company s net retail sales were made under its proprietary credit card program  which resulted in customer accounts receivable balances of approximately  at february  the company has significant experience in managing its credit card program 
each month  the company reviews all of its credit card accounts and writes off those deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained and periodically reviewed 
the allowance is primarily based on account write off trends and aging information 
the company does not expect actual results to vary significantly from our estimate 
the company uses the retail inventory method 
under this method  the company records markdowns to value merchandise inventories at net realizable value 
the company closely monitors actual and forecasted sales trends  current inventory levels  and aging information by merchandise categories 
if forecasted sales are not achieved  additional markdowns may be needed in future periods to clear excess or slow moving merchandise  which may result in lower gross margins 
when a store experiences unfavorable operating performance  the company evaluates whether an impairment charge should be recorded 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the store s estimated undiscounted cash flows to the assets carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  the assets are written down to fair value 
impairment losses associated with these reviews have not been significant 
however  if comparative store sales decline and general negative economic trends continue  future impairment losses could be significant 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that an impairment loss be recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and that the measurement of any impairment loss be the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
adoption of sfas no 
is required for financial statements for periods beginning after december  the company will adopt this new standard effective february  and management believes the adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operation 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements may be preceded or followed by or otherwise include the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  estimates  will  would  could or similar expressions 
such forward looking statements  which reflect the company s current views of future events and financial performance  involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from planned or expected results 
those risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the impact of competition  pricing pressure  product demand and market acceptance risks  mergers and acquisitions  reliance on key strategic alliances  the ability to attract and retain key employees  the availability of cash for growth  fluctuations in operating results  ability to continue funding operating losses  and the ability of new manag ement to improve the company s financial condition and performance 
for all of these reasons  actual results may vary materially from the forward looking statements 
the company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for the company refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how the company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate at february   the company had long term debt outstanding of approximately million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 
the remaining million bears interest at variable rates which averaged approximately during a increase in short term interest rates on the variable rate debt outstanding at february  would approximate basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change is also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
the table below provides information about the company s debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates expected maturity in thousands thereafter total long term debt variable rate weighted average interest rate fixed rate weighted average interest rate foreign currency substantially all of the company s purchases are priced in us dollars 
however  some european purchases are denominated in local currency and  therefore  are subject to the fluctuation in currency exchange rates 
from time to time the company utilizes forward exchange contracts to secure firm pricing related to purchase commitments to be denominated in foreign currencies 
the contracts are of varying short term durations and amounts include a window delivery feature  which provides the company with an option to enter into a swap agreement in the event that all of the currency is not utilized at the end of the contract s delivery term 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the principal currency hedged is the italian lira 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
the company had no foreign exchange instruments outstanding at february   therefore  a sensitivity analysis would result in no impact to earnings 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies would be excluded from the sensitivity analysis 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company during  or
