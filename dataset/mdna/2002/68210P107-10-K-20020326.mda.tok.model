item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal and fiscal  the company elected to discontinue in line processing operations at its morgan city plant for the and fishing season 
an impairment of million was recorded in fiscal to reduce the cost of the in line processing equipment to its salvage value 
the closure of this plant did not impact the company s ability to process its products since the company had excess production capacity at its other three gulf coast plants 
warehousing operations are being conducted at the facility until market conditions improve or other opportunities develop for the property 
geographic information the company operates within one industry segment  menhaden fishing for the production and sale of fish meal  fish solubles and fish oil 
export sales of fish oil and fish meal were approximately million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal respectively 
such sales were made primarily to european markets 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  sales to one customer were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the following table shows the geographical distribution of revenues in thousands based on location of customers for year ended for year ended for year ended december  december  december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent us    europe    asia    mexico    canada    other    total    company overview the company s marine protein operations involve the production and sale of a variety of protein products derived from menhaden  a species of fish found along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coasts 
omega is the largest processor  marketer and distributor of marine products fish meal and fats fish oil in the united states 
the company processes several grades of fish meal regular or faq meal and specialty meals  as well as fish oil and fish solubles 
the company s fish meal products are primarily used as a protein ingredient in animal feed for poultry  swine  cattle  aquaculture and household pets 
the company s fish oil is primarily used as an ingredient in margarine and shortening 
the company s fish solubles are sold primarily to livestock feed manufacturers  aquaculture feed manufacturers and for use as an organic fertilizer 
fishing 
during fiscal  the company owned a fleet of fishing vessels and spotter aircraft for use in its fishing operations and also leased additional aircraft where necessary to facilitate operations 
during the fishing season in the gulf of mexico  where the fishing season runs from mid april through october  the company operated fishing vessels and spotter aircraft 
the fishing area in the gulf is generally located along the gulf coast  with a concentration off the louisiana and mississippi coasts 
the fishing season along the atlantic coast begins in early may and usually extends into december 
the company operated fishing vessels and spotter aircraft along the mid atlantic coast  concentrated primarily in and around the chesapeake bay 
the remaining fleet of fishing vessels and spotter aircraft are not routinely operated during the fishing season and are back up to the active fleet 
subsequent to the fiscal fishing season  the company embarked on a program of cost cutting measures which included  among other items  a reduction in the number of fishing vessels and spotter planes deployed 
since fiscal  the deployment of fishing vessels and spotter planes has been reduced by vessels and planes 
menhaden usually school in large  tight clusters and are commonly found in warm  shallow waters 
spotter aircraft locate the schools and direct the fishing vessels to them 
the principal fishing vessels transport two foot purse boats  each carrying several fishermen and one end of a  foot net 
the purse boats encircle the school and capture the fish in the net 
the fish are then pumped from the net into refrigerated holds of the fishing vessel or onto a carry vessel  and then are unloaded at the company s processing plants 
processing 
during fiscal  the company operated four processing plants  two in louisiana  one in mississippi and one in virginia  where the menhaden are processed into fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles 
the fish are unloaded from the fishing vessels into storage boxes and then conveyed into steam cookers 
the fish are then passed through presses to remove most of the oil and water 
the solid portions of the fish are dried and then ground into fish meal 
the liquid that is produced in the cooking and pressing operations contains oil  water  dissolved protein and some fish solids 
this liquid is decanted to remove the solids and is then put through a centrifugal oil and water separation process 
the separated fish oil is a finished product 
the separated water and protein mixture is further processed through evaporators to recover the soluble protein  which can be sold as a finished product or added to the solid portions of the fish for processing into fish meal 
fish meal  the principal product made from menhaden  is sold primarily as a high protein feed ingredient 
it is used as a protein supplement in feed formulated for pigs and other livestock 
each use requires certain standards to be met regarding quality and protein content  which are determined by the freshness of the fish and by processing conditions such as speed and temperatures 
fish solubles are a liquid protein product used as an additive in fish meal and are also marketed as an independent product to animal feed formulators and the fertilizer industry 
fish oil from menhaden is widely used for human consumption as an edible fat in europe 
refined and hydrogenated menhaden oils have a wide variety of applications as ingredients of margarine  cooking oil and solid cooking fats used in baked goods 
in june  the us food and drug administration approved the use of refined non hydrogenated menhaden oil  a natural source of omega fatty acids  for human consumption in the united states 
ongoing scientific studies continue to link consumption of omega rich fish oil to a number of nutritional and health benefits 
customers and marketing 
most of the company s marine protein products are sold directly to about customers by the company s marketing department  while a smaller amount is sold through independent sales agents 
product inventory was million as of december  versus million on december  the company s fish meal is sold primarily to domestic feed producers for utilization as a high protein ingredient for the poultry  swine  aquaculture and pet food industries 
fish oil sales primarily involve export markets where the fish oil is refined for use as an edible oil 
the company s products are sold both in the us and internationally 
international sales consist mainly of fish oil sales to canada  japan  mexico and the netherlands 
the company s sales in these foreign markets are denominated in us dollars and not directly affected by currency fluctuations 
such sales could be adversely affected by changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
a number of countries in which the company currently sells products impose various tariffs and duties  none of which have a significant impact on the company s foreign sales 
certain of these duties are being reduced annually under the north american free trade agreement in the case of mexico and canada and under the uruguay round agreement of the general agreement on tariffs and trade in the case of japan 
in all cases  the company s products are shipped to its customers either by fob shipping point or cif terms  and therefore  the customer is responsible for any tariffs  duties or other levies imposed on the company s products sold into these markets 
insurance 
the company maintains insurance against physical loss and damage to its assets  coverage against liabilities to third parties it may incur in the course of its operations  as well as workers compensation  united states longshoremen s and harbor workers compensation act and jones act coverage 
assets are insured at replacement cost  market value or assessed earning power 
the company s limits for liability coverage are statutory or million 
the million limit is comprised of several excess liability policies  which are subject to deductibles  underlying limits and exclusions 
the company believes its insurance coverage to be in such form  against such risks  for such amounts and subject to such deductibles and self retentions as are prudent and normal for its operations 
the impact of the september  terrorist attacks  as well as a general hardening of the world insurance markets  is likely to make the company s insurance more costly as various lines of insurance come up for renewal in depending on the magnitude of the increase in insurance premiums  the company may elect to increase its deductibles and self retentions in order to achieve lower insurance premium costs 
these higher deductibles and self retentions will expose the company to greater risk of loss if claims occur 
competition 
the marine protein and oil business is subject to significant competition from producers of vegetable and other animal protein products and oil products such as archer daniels midland  inc and cargill  inc 
in addition  but to a lesser extent  the company competes with smaller domestic privately owned menhaden fishing companies and international marine protein and oil producers  including scandinavian herring processors and south american anchovy and sardine processors 
many of these competitors have greater financial resources and more extensive operations than the company 
omega competes on price  quality and performance characteristics of its products  such as protein level and amino acid profile in the case of fish meal 
the principal competition for the company s fish meal and fish solubles is from other protein sources such as soybean meal and other vegetable or animal protein products 
the company believes  however  that these other sources are not complete substitutes because fish meal offers nutritional values not contained in such sources 
vegetable fats and oils  such as soybean and palm oils  provide the primary market competition for fish oil 
fish meal prices have historically borne a relationship to prevailing soybean meal prices  while prices for fish oil are generally influenced by prices for vegetable fats and oils  such as soybean and palm oils 
thus  the prices for the company s products are established by worldwide supply and demand relationships over which the company has no control and tend to fluctuate to a significant extent over the course of a year and from year to year 
regulation 
the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the location and periods in which fishing may be conducted as well as environmental and safety matters 
at the state and local level  certain state and local government agencies have either enacted legislation and regulations or have the authority to enact with legislation and regulation to prohibit  restrict or regulate menhaden fishing within their jurisdictional waters 
in january  the state of new jersey enacted legislation which extended an existing mile no fishing zone for menhaden an additional miles offshore 
omega historically has caught an immaterial amount of its fish catch in the newly closed area and believes that this restriction will have no material effect on the company s operations or financial results 
omega remains able to conduct its fishing operations off new jersey outside this new three mile limit 
the company  through its operation of fishing vessels  is subject to the jurisdiction of the us coast guard  the national transportation safety board and the us customs service 
the us coast guard and the national transportation safety board set safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
the us customs service is authorized to inspect vessels at will 
the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including the federal water pollution control act of  which was significantly modified in to deal with toxic water pollutants and re named as the clean water act  and which imposes strict controls against the discharge of pollutants in reportable quantities  and along with the oil pollution act of  imposes substantial liability for the costs of oil removal  remediation and damages 
the company s marine protein operations also are subject to the federal clean air act  as amended  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  which imposes liability  without regard to fault  on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of any hazardous substances into the environment  us coast guard regulations and the federal occupational safety and health act osha 
in january  the united states supreme court ruled that  in addition of the united states coast guard  the occupational safety and health administration has the authority to regulate working conditions aboard certain types of vessels which include the company s fishing vessels 
the eventual implementation of this ruling which is expected to occur over a period of years is expected to result in additional safety requirements and procedures for the company s vessels 
it is possible that the costs of these requirements and procedures could be material 
the osha hazard communications standard  the environmental protection agency community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and similar state statutes require the company to organize information about hazardous materials used or produced in its operations 
certain of this information must be provided to employees  state and local governmental authorities and local citizens 
numerous other environmental laws and regulations  along with similar state laws  also apply to the operations of the company  and all such laws and regulations are subject to change 
the company has made  and anticipates that it will make in the future  expenditures in the ordinary course of its business in connection with environmental matters 
such expenditures have not been material in the past and are not expected to be material in the future 
however  there is no assurance that environmental laws and regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect the company s operations 
the company s harvesting operations are subject to the shipping act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the department of transportation  maritime administration which require  among other things  that the company be incorporated under the laws of the us or a state  the company s chief executive officer be a us citizen  no more of the company s directors be non citizens than a minority of the number necessary to constitute a quorum and at least of the company s outstanding capital stock including a majority of the company s voting capital stock be owned by us citizens 
if the company fails to observe any of these requirements  it will not be eligible to conduct its harvesting activities in us jurisdictional waters 
such a loss of eligibility would have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
to protect against such loss of eligibility  the company s articles of incorporation i contain provisions limiting the aggregate percentage ownership by non citizens of each class of the company s capital stock to no more than of the outstanding shares of each such class the permitted percentage so that any purported transfer to non citizens of shares in excess of the permitted percentage will be ineffective as against the company for all purposes including for purposes of voting  dividends and any other distribution  upon liquidation or otherwise  ii provide for a dual stock certificate system to determine such ownership pursuant to which certificates representing shares of company common stock bear legends that designate such certificates as either citizen or non citizen depending on the citizenship of the owner  and iii permit the company s board of directors to make such determinations as may reasonably be necessary to ascertain such ownership and implement restrictive limitations on those shares that exceed the permitted percentage the excess shares 
for example  the company s board is authorized  among other things  to redeem for cash upon written notice any excess shares in order to reduce the aggregate ownership by non citizens to the permitted percentage 
the company believes that during the past five years it has substantially complied with all material statutes and regulations applicable to its operations  the failure to comply with which would have had a material adverse impact on its operations 
employees at december   during the company s off season  the company employed approximately persons 
at august   during the peak of the company s fishing season  the company employed approximately persons 
approximately employees at the company s virginia facility are represented by an affiliate of the united food and commercial workers union

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company appearing under item herein 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings or stockholders equity 
general business 
omega is the largest us producer of protein rich meal and oil derived from marine sources 
the company s products are produced from menhaden a fish found in commercial quantities  and include regular grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles 
the company s fish meal products are used as nutritional feed additives by animal feed manufacturers and by commercial livestock and poultry farmers 
the company s crude fish oil is sold to food producers in europe and its refined fish oil products are used in aquaculture feeds and certain industrial applications 
fish solubles are sold as protein additives for animal feed and as fertilizers 
the fish catch is processed into regular grade fish meal  specialty fish meals  fish oils and fish solubles at the company s four operating plants located in virginia  mississippi and louisiana 
the company owns fishing vessels of which were directly involved in the harvesting operations during fiscal and owns and leases spotter aircraft of which were directly involved in the harvesting operations during fiscal that are used to harvest menhaden in coastal waters along the us mid atlantic and gulf of mexico coasts 
in  the company converted several of its fishing vessels to carry vessels which do not engage in active fishing but instead carry fish from the company s offshore fishing vessels to its plants 
utilization of carry vessels increases the amount of time that certain of the company s fishing vessels remain offshore fishing productive waters and therefore increases the company s fish catch per vessel employed 
the carry vessels have reduced crews and crew expenses and incur less maintenance cost than the actual fishing vessels 
additionally  the company elected to cease its in line processing operations at its morgan city  louisiana plant location prior to the fiscal fishing season  and does not plan to reopen the plant for the fishing season 
certain damaged processing equipment at this facility has been removed and scrapped 
the closure of this plant did not impact the company s continuing ability to process all its gulf coast production  even though fishing efforts were not reduced  since the company had excess production capacity at its remaining three gulf coast plants 
warehousing operations are being conducted at the morgan city facility until market conditions improve or other opportunities develop for the property 
previous disposition and acquisitions 
the company closed the venture milling disposition on september  the company also closed the american protein acquisition on november  and the gulf protein acquisition on november  both acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and  therefore  their results of operations were included in the company s statement of operations as of the closing dates for each acquisition 
fiscal year change 
on december  the company s board of directors approved a change in the company s fiscal year end from september to december  effective beginning january  a three month transition period from october  through december  the transition period precedes the start of the fiscal year 
fiscal and fiscal refer to respective fiscal years ended september the transition period refers to the three months ended december  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal refer to the respective fiscal twelve months ended december harvesting and production 
the following table summarizes the company s harvesting and production for the indicated periods three months years ended year ended year ended year ended ended september  december  december  december  december  fish catch tons       production tons fish meal regular grade       special select       sea lac       silver herring   oil crude       refined       solubles       total production 
      fish catch has been converted to tons using the national marine fisheries service nmfs fish catch conversion ratio of pounds per  fish 
the company s harvesting season generally extends from may through december on the mid atlantic coast and from april through october on the gulf coast 
during the off season  the company fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the previous fishing season 
prices for the company s products tend to be lower during the fishing season when product is more abundant than in the off season 
throughout the entire year  prices are significantly influenced by supply and demand in world markets for competing products  particularly soybean meal for its fish meal products and vegetable fats and oils for its fish oil products when used as an alternative to vegetable fats and oils 
during fiscal and continuing through fiscal  world grain and oilseed markets were burdened by excess supplies relative to demand which  in turn  resulted in prices for most major commodities being sharply lower than in previous years 
correspondingly  the company s product prices were adversely impacted during these periods  resulting in decreased gross margins 
during fiscal and again during fiscal  the company determined that the costs of its fish meal and fish oil product inventories were in excess of those products realization value by approximately million and million  respectively 
this realization was due mainly to the continuing depressed market values of world protein markets and particularly  animal and oilseed oil markets 
the average prices received for the company s fish meal and fish oil products were approximately and lower  respectively  during fiscal as compared to fiscal price decreases continued during fiscal and fish meal and fish oil were approximately and  respectively  lower than fiscal average prices 
also impacting fiscal and contributing to the write down of inventories was the reduced crude fish oil production yields approximately lower yields compared to fiscal experienced during the majority of the fiscal fishing season in the gulf of mexico 
these reduced yields were primarily a result of the reduced fat content in the fish which was a result of poor nutritional conditions caused by the extreme drought conditions suffered by the gulf of mexico region during late fiscal and early fiscal the depressed pricing conditions of fiscal years and continued into the early months of fiscal before making modest reversals 
these price increases continued throughout the remainder of the year and were the result of diminished global fish meal and fish oil inventories as opposed to a stronger world demand for other competing products 
management believes that it is possible that these price increases have reached a plateau and stabilized at this time 
future product price volatility will depend upon the perceived international availability of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
accordingly  gross profit margins may vary in the future 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  the company is continuing its efforts towards the production and marketing of specialty meal products  which generally have higher margins than the company s regular grade meal product 
additionally  the company is attempting to introduce its refined fish oil into the food market 
the company has had some success selling its refined fish oil  trademarked omegapure tm  to food manufacturers in the united states and canada at prices that provide substantially improved margins over the margins that can be obtained from selling non refined crude fish oil 
the company cannot estimate  however  the size of the actual domestic market for omegapure tm or how long it may take to develop this market 
historically  approximately to of omega s regular grade fish meal was sold on a two to six month forward contract basis 
the balance of regular grade and other products was substantially sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
the company has begun a similar forward sales program for its specialty grade meals and crude fish oil for fiscal due to increasing demand for these products 
the company s annual revenues are highly dependent on both annual fish catch and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one fiscal year to another fiscal year 
the company determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on prevailing market prices of the products and anticipated customer usage and demand during the off season 
thus  production volume does not necessarily correlate with sales volume in the same fiscal year and sales volumes will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the company s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production 
practically  however  the company typically attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
the company s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal 
the following table sets forth the company s revenues by product in millions and the approximate percentage of total revenues represented thereby  for the indicated periods year ended december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent regular grade special select sea lac crude oil refined oil fish solubles nets and other total liquidity and capital resources the company s primary resources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash flows from operations  bank credit facilities and term loans from various lenders provided pursuant to title xi of the marine act of title xi 
these sources of cash flows have been used for capital expenditures and payment of long term debt 
the company expects to finance future expenditures through internally generated cash flows and  if necessary  through funds available from the credit facility and or title xi facilities described below 
under a program offered through national marine fisheries services nmfs pursuant to title xi  the company has secured loans through lenders with terms generally ranging between and years at interest rates between and per annum which are enhanced with a government guaranty to the lender for up to of the financing 
the company s current title xi borrowings are secured by liens on fishing vessels and mortgages on the company s reedville  virginia and abbeville  louisiana plants 
in  title xi borrowing was modified to permit use of proceeds from borrowings obtained through this program for shoreside construction 
the company used the entire million amount originally authorized under the program 
loans are now available under similar terms pursuant to the title xi program without intervening lenders 
the company borrowed million under this new program during fiscal omega had an unrestricted cash balance of million at december   up million from december  this increase was due primarily to operating profits as a result of increased selling prices for the company s products  further enhanced by reduced harvesting costs 
the company s liquidity is greatly influenced by the selling prices received for its products 
should the company experience decreased pricing in the future  as it did experience in fiscal and fiscal  liquidity would decline and the company would possibly have to utilize its working capital credit facility 
the company s long term debt at december  and was million and million  respectively 
current maturities attributable to the company s long term debt were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company has not utilized its working capital credit facility during fiscal and fiscal the company has no off balance sheet arrangements other than normal operating leases and standby letters of credit 
the following tables aggregate information about the company s contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in thousands as of december  payments due by period less than to to after contractual cash obligations total year years years years long term debt      operating leases  minimum pension liability   total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period less than to to after other commercial commitments total year years years years credit facility  standby letters of credit   total commercial commitments   as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings outstanding under the million credit facility 
investing activities used million in fiscal while using million  and million during fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
the company s investing activities consisted mainly of capital expenditures for equipment purchases and replacements in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal the company anticipates making approximately million of capital expenditures in fiscal  a significant portion of which will be used to refurbish vessels and plant assets and to repair certain equipment 
if the company elects to re establish normal production at its morgan city plant operations for fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles  then various components of the in line processing equipment will have to be upgraded or replaced 
such equipment would include the driers  cookers and presses 
it is estimated that replacement of this equipment would cost to million 
net financing activities provided  during fiscal compared with million used in fiscal the fiscal use of cash in financing activities is due to million in debt repayment 
the  provided by net financing activities in fiscal is due to net proceeds of title xi borrowing of million 
on december   the company entered into a million revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na the credit facility 
under the credit facility the company may make borrowings in a principal amount not to exceed million at any time 
borrowings under this facility may be used to finance ongoing working capital needs  to make acquisitions  and to issue standby or commercial letters of credit 
interest accrues on borrowings that will be outstanding under the credit facility at either i libor plus basis points or ii at the company s option  the bank s prime rate 
the credit facility is collateralized by all of the company s trade receivables  inventory and equipment 
the company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth and maintenance of minimum ebitda 
in addition  the credit facility does not allow for the payment of cash dividends or stock repurchases and also limits capital expenditures and investments 
through december   the company had made no borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit facility expires on december  on september   the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program allowing the company to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock 
see item market for the registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
the company has repurchased  shares pursuant to such authorization 
the repurchase program has been terminated because the company s credit facility prohibits such purchases 
the company s principal raw material is menhaden  a species of fish that inhabits coastal and inland tidal waters in the united states 
menhaden are undesirable for human consumption due to their small size  prominent bones and high oil content 
certain state agencies impose resource depletion restrictions on menhaden pursuant to fisheries management legislation or regulations 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse impact on its fish catch or results of operations as a result of these restrictions 
the company from time to time considers potential transactions including  but not limited to  enhancement of physical facilities to improve production capabilities and the acquisition of other businesses 
certain of the potential transactions reviewed by the company would  if completed  result in its entering new lines of business generally including certain businesses to which the company sells its products such as pet food manufacturers  fertilizer companies and organic foods distributors although historically  reviewed opportunities have been generally related in some manner to the company s existing operations 
although the company does not  as of the date hereof  have any commitment with respect to a material acquisition  it could enter into such agreement in the future 
in january  the united states supreme court ruled that  in addition of the united states coast guard  the occupational safety and health administration has the authority to regulate working conditions aboard certain types of vessels which include the company s fishing vessels 
the eventual implementation of this ruling which is expected to occur over a period of years is expected to result in additional safety requirements and procedures for the company s vessels 
it is possible that the costs of these requirements and procedures could be material 
the company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and jones act liability for employees aboard its vessels collectively  vessel claims insurance 
the typical vessel claims insurance policy contains an annual aggregate deductible aad for which the company remains responsible  while the insurance carrier is responsible for all applicable amounts which exceed the aad 
it is the company s policy to accrue current amounts due and record amounts paid out on each claim 
once payments exceed the aad  the company records an insurance receivable for a given policy year 
during fiscal  the company s vessel claims insurance carrier for the policy period october  through march  filed for bankruptcy protection 
this bankruptcy filing caused the company to provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for a significant portion of the amounts due to the company from the insurance carrier 
the impact of the september  terrorist attacks  as well as a general hardening of the world insurance markets  is likely to make the company s insurance more costly as various lines of insurance come up for renewal in depending on the magnitude of the increase in insurance premiums  the company may elect to increase its deductibles and self retentions in order to achieve lower insurance premium costs 
these higher deductibles and self retentions will expose the company to greater risk of loss if claims occur 
the company believes that the existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funds available through its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of fiscal significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein  including estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant of these involving difficult or complex judgments in any particular reporting period includes inventory lower of cost or market analyses 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s fishing season runs from mid april to the first of november in the gulf of mexico and from the beginning of may into december in the atlantic 
government regulations preclude the company from fishing during the off seasons 
the company s inventory cost system considers all costs associated with an annual fish catch and its processing  both variable and fixed and including both costs incurred during the off season and during the fishing season 
the company s costing system allocates cost to inventory quantities on a per unit basis as calculated by a formula that considers total estimated inventoriable costs for a fishing season including off season costs to total estimated fish catch and the relative fair market value of the individual products produced 
the company adjusts the cost of sales  off season costs and inventory balances at the end of each quarter based on revised estimates of total inventoriable costs and fish catch 
the company s lower of cost or market value analyses at year end and at interim periods compares the total estimated per unit production cost of the company s expected production to the projected per unit market prices of the products 
the impairment analyses involve estimates of  among other things  future fish catches and related costs  and expected commodity prices for the fish products 
these estimates  which management believes are reasonable and supportable  involve estimates of future activities and events which are inherently imprecise and for which actual results may differ 
during the off seasons  in connection with the upcoming fishing seasons  the company incurs costs ie  plant and vessel related labor  utilities  rent  repairs  and depreciation that are directly related to the company s infrastructure 
these costs accumulate in inventory and are applied as elements of the cost of production of the company s products throughout the fishing season ratably based on the company s monthly fish catch and the expected total fish catch for the season 
as mentioned previously  the company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and jones act liabilities for employees aboard its vessel 
the company provides reserves for those portions of the aad for which the company remains responsible by using an estimation process that considers company specific and industry data as well as management s experience assumptions and consultant with outside counsel 
management s current estimated range of liabilities related to such cases is based on claims for which management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
the company has recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revise its estimates 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the company s results of operation and financial position

during the five years prior to fiscal  the company generated taxable income in excess of the taxable losses incurred during fiscal and the fiscal net operating loss was utilized via carryback to the prior two tax years

seasonal and quarterly results the company s menhaden harvesting and processing business is seasonal in nature 
the company generally has higher sales during the menhaden harvesting season which includes the second and third quarter of each fiscal year due to increased product availability  but prices during the fishing season tend to be lower than during the off season 
as a result  the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future 
in addition  from time to time the company defers sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products that affect prices for the company s products which may affect comparable period comparisons 
certain quarterly financial data contained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report is incorporated herein by reference 
significant factors that may affect forward looking statements the company wishes to caution investors that the following significant factors  and those factors described elsewhere in this report  other filings by the company with the sec from time to time and press releases issued by the company  could affect the company s actual results which may differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company the company s ability to meet its raw material requirements through its annual menhaden harvest  which is subject to fluctuation due to natural conditions over which the company has no control  such as varying fish population  adverse weather conditions and disease 
the impact on the company if its spotter aircraft are prohibited or restricted from operating in their normal manner during the company s fishing season 
for example  as a direct result of the september  terrorist attacks  the secretary of transportation issued a federal ground stop order that grounded certain aircraft including the company s fish spotting aircraft for approximately nine days 
this loss of spotter aircraft coverage severely hampered the company s ability to locate menhaden fish during this nine day period and thereby reduced its amount of saleable product 
the impact on the prices for the company s products of worldwide supply and demand relationships over which the company has no control and which tend to fluctuate to a significant extent over the course of a year and from year to year 
the products that influence the supply and demand relationship are world supplies of fish meal made from other fish species  palm oil  soy meal and oil  and other edible oils 
the impact of a violation by the company of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to menhaden fishing and the protection of the environment and the health and safety of its employees or of the adoption of new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations that materially adversely affect the company s business 
the impact on the company if it cannot harvest menhaden in us jurisdictional waters if the company fails to comply with us citizenship ownership requirements 
risks inherent in the company s venture into the sale of refined  non hydrogenated menhaden oil for consumption in the us  including the unproven market for this product 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results due to the seasonality of the company s business and the company s deferral of sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products 
the ability of the company to retain and recruit key officers and qualified personnel  vessel captains and crewmembers 
risks associated with the strength of local currencies of the countries in which its products are sold  changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations and international trade  including changes in the law and policies that govern foreign investment and international trade in such countries  changes in u 
s laws and regulations relating to foreign investment and trade  changes in tax or other laws  partial or total expatriation  currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation  the disruption of labor  political disturbances  insurrection or war and the effect of requirements of partial local ownership of operations in certain countries risks related to unanticipated material adverse outcomes in any pending litigation or any other unfavorable outcomes or settlements 
there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in any pending litigation and to the extent that the company sustains losses growing out of any pending litigation which are not presently reserved or otherwise provided for or insured against  its business  results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in the future the company may undertake acquisitions  although there is no assurance this will occur 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to profitably manage future businesses it may acquire or successfully integrate future businesses it may acquire into the company without substantial costs  delays or other problems which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the financial condition of the company is exposed to minimal market risk associated with interest rate movements on the company s borrowings 
a one percent increase or decrease in the levels of interest rates on variable rate debt would not result in a material change to the company s results of operations 
although the company sells products in foreign countries  all of the company s revenues are billed and paid for in us dollars 
as a result  management does not believe that the company is exposed to any significant foreign country currency exchange risk  and the company does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to this risk
