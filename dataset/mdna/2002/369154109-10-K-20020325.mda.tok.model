operating income year ended december  document finishing films group office products group europe group other operating income other includes shared expenses not allocated to the specific segments  unallocated goodwill amortization  corporate expenses  and the results for certain entities not assigned to one of the other four segments 
operating income for increased million compared to this comparison is significantly impacted by the million of inventory rationalization and write down charges recorded in excluding the impact of these charges million  operating income in the document finishing group was lower due to the fact that the improvement in gross profit margins was not enough to overcome the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income for the films group was favorably impacted by higher sales along with lower selling  service and administrative costs 
excluding inventory rationalization and write down charges  operating income in the office products group increased million as a result of the higher sales level and improved gross profit margins which more than offset slightly higher customer program costs along with higher administrative expenses 
costs incurred to exit the visual communications business in the united kingdom  and inventory rationalization and write down charges totaled million in europe 
excluding the impact of these charges  europe s operating loss was reduced by million to million during compared to  the most significant reason for the reduced european loss was the exiting of the visual communications business in the united kingdom

in liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its overall debt capacity and ability to generate cash from operations to fund its operating and investing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  customer financing requirements  adequate bank lines of credit and financial flexibility to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
gbc s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flows  borrowings under gbc s revolving credit facilities and short term borrowings from banks 
gbc had access to various us and international credit facilities  including a multicurrency revolving credit facility established on january  the revolving credit facility or facility and initially amended and restated on november  with a group of international institutions which provided for up to million of revolving credit borrowings through its maturity date of january  outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled million at december  offsetting a portion of these borrowings at december  were cash and short term investments totaling million 
effective january   gbc further amended and restated the revolving credit facility 
the size of the facility was reduced by million  from million to million  and is comprised of a million multicurrency revolving credit facility and term loans totaling million 
the maturity date of approximately million of the facility was extended until january   and the maturity date on approximately million of the term loans has been extended to july  the facility also provides for significantly higher interest rates than those payable under the previous facility  a reflection of current bank credit market conditions and the extended maturity 
interest rates on the facility are set at libor plus  except the term loans expiring on july  which carry a rate of libor plus 
gbc has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of its libor floating rate interest exposure under the facility 
as of december   approximatel y million of borrowings under the facility were hedged 
the one month libor rate at december  was approximately 
a significant increase in libor would result in increased interest expense on the unhedged portion of gbc s floating rate debt 
as a result of the amendment and restatement of the revolving credit facility in january  gbc is subject to certain financial covenants beginning with the first quarter of under the most restrictive covenants  gbc must meet certain minimum ebitda targets  as well as leverage and interest coverage hurdles 
in addition  future credit availability will be based on a borrowing base comprised of certain of its trade receivables and inventory 
there will also continue to be restrictions on dividend payments  acquisitions  additional indebtedness  and capital expenditures 
substantially all of the assets of general binding corporation and its domestic subsidiaries remain pledged as collateral  as well as a portion of the equity in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the most restrictive covenants under the revolving credit facility require the company to meet the following targets and ratios minimum ebitda levels ebitda is generally defined in the facility as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the facility also provides for the addback of certain expenses defined as programs incurred by the company to execute its operational excellence program 
the facility requires that gbc achieve a minimum cumulative trailing four quarter ebitda of million as of the end of each quarter ending march  through september   and million as of the end of each quarter thereafter 
minimum leverage ratios there are two leverage ratio tests under the facility 
these ratios are computed by dividing the cumulative four quarter trailing ebitda into the company s total outstanding borrowings and its senior borrowings 
the facility requires that gbc s leverage not exceed ratios as of the end of each quarter no higher than total debt senior debt q to to q and q to to q to to q to to q and q to to thereafter to to maximum interest coverage ratio interest coverage is defined under the facility as the cumulative trailing four quarter ebitda divided by interest expense 
as of the end of each quarter  gbc must maintain a ratio higher than to until the maturity date 
as of december   gbc was in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit facility 
the company expects to remain in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit facility based upon its current financial forecast 
the financial forecast assumes that there will be no further significant deterioration of worldwide economic conditions and that certain objectives of the operational excellence program will be achieved 
if the economic prospects in the economies in which gbc does business and or certain goals and objectives of the operational excellence program are not met  it is possible that the company will fail one or more of its covenants 
if gbc was unable to obtain an amendment to the facility or a waiver of any covenant violation s  the company s liquidity would be adversely impacted to a significant degree 
the revolving credit facility includes a million multicurrency borrowing facility that gbc uses to fund its working capital requirements 
the company s borrowing capacity under the facility is limited by a borrowing base 
the borrowing base is generally computed as of eligible trade receivables and of eligible inventory 
eligible receivables are generally defined as current domestic and canadian receivables  and eligible inventory is generally defined as inventory owned by gbc s domestic and canadian operations 
at december   gbc s borrowing base was adequate to support expected future working capital requirements 
if  however  there were to be a significant deterioration in the quality of gbc s eligible receivables or inventory there can be no assurance that adequate liquidity would be available under the revolving credit facility 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the most significant item impacting cash flows from operations were net income tax refunds of million received in  compared to net income tax payments of million in net cash used in investing activities was million during  as compared to million in a reduction in capital expenditures of million from to accounted for most of the change 
major capital projects in and included investments in facilities and equipment for a new commercial film plant in south korea million in and million in  and approximately million for implementation of business information systems in  including gbc s e commerce initiatives 
major projects in included the implementation of business information systems in europe and the us of million  equipping and setting up three manufacturing facilities in the us of million in  facilities to support the integration of gbc s office products business subsequent to the acquisition of ibico  and tooling of new products 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during  compared to million of cash used in financing activities during in the latter part of  management increased the company s borrowings under the revolving credit facility above normal levels to ensure adequate liquidity while finalizing the amendment of the revolving credit facility 
approximately million of borrowings were repaid in january upon the amendment of the revolving credit facility 
excluding these additional borrowings at december  gbc would have reported a reduction in debt of approximately million during during  gbc made debt repayments of million 
gbc has been restricted from paying dividends under the terms of the amendment and restatement of the revolving credit facility  and therefore no dividends were paid during and contractual financial obligations gbc s primary contractual cash obligations consist of principle payments on debt obligations and operating lease obligations 
the table below summarizes gbc s contractual obligations at december  in millions payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases total commercial financial commitments at december   gbc had the following commercial financial commitments approximately million of standby letters of credit which primarily support domestic workers compensation claims and import purchases for several of the company s international subsidiaries  a standby letter of credit of million supporting working capital borrowings for a less than owned joint venture in india  and a guarantee of approximately million supporting working capital borrowings for a owned joint venture in australia 
the terms of the letters of credit expire during gbc has also guaranteed the borrowings of certain wholly owned international subsidiaries at december  total guarantees were approximately million  and outstanding borrowings against the guaranteed facilities were approximately million 
credit concentration gbc has several customers within the office products group which  in the normal course of business  make significant purchases from the company 
trade receivable balances from these customers have ranged from million 
as a result  at any point in time  gbc may have a significant concentration of its accounts receivable balance among this customer group 
to mitigate the credit risk among this group of customers  management closely monitors trends in the office products market  as well as the financial condition and payment trends of these customers 
market risk disclosures gbc is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates which may affect the results of its operations and financial condition 
gbc seeks to manage these risks through its regular operating and financing activities  and when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
gbc does not use any derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not a party to any leveraged financial instruments 
the methods used by gbc to assess and mitigate the market risks discussed herein should not be considered projections of future events and exposures 
foreign exchange risk management as a result of gbc s global activities  the company has assets  liabilities  loans and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
from time to time  gbc utilizes a foreign exchange risk management program to manage its foreign exchange exposures to help minimize the adverse impact of currency movements 
certain loans and cash flows in the us and in foreign countries are currently hedged through foreign currency forward contracts 
the majority of gbc s exposures to currency movements are in europe  the asia pacific  canada and mexico  and the significant hedging transactions related to these areas outstanding as of december  are presented below 
all of the outstanding contracts have maturity dates in increases and decreases in the fair market values of the forward agreements are completely offset by changes in the values of the net underlying foreign currency transaction exposures 
gbc s contracts are primarily for the sale of foreign currencies and the purchase of us dollars 
selected information related to gbc s foreign exchange contracts as of december  is as follows in millions forward contracts as of december  average exchange notional fair market gain currency sold currency purchased rate amount value loss euros us dollars canadian dollars us dollars british pounds us dollars australian dollars us dollars japanese yen us dollars singapore dollars us dollars us dollars euros us dollars mexican pesos british pounds euros us dollars canadian dollars other total as of december   gbc had recorded unrealized losses of approximately million in its income statement related to hedges of intercompany loans hedge accounting has not been applied to these transactions 
unrealized gains of approximately million related to hedges of intercompany inventory purchases have been recorded in other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk management as a result of gbc s funding program for its global activities  gbc has various debt obligations that pay interest on the basis of fixed and floating rates 
gbc utilizes an interest rate management program to reduce its exposures to floating interest rates and achieve a desired risk profile 
to accomplish this objective  gbc currently hedges these exposures by using interest rate swap and cap agreements 
the table below provides information about gbc s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents significant principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates

euro on january   a majority of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
the euro trades on currency exchanges  and the participating countries own currencies legacy currencies remained legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during the transition period  parties could have elected pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that these legacy currencies will no longer be available after july  the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
gbc has assessed its pricing marketing strategy and believes that it will remain competitive in a broader european market 
gbc has also upgraded its information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro  and to accommodate the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies 
gbc s currency risk and risk management programs for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
gbc currently conducts a significant portion of its european transactions  as well as foreign exchange hedges  in the euro 
based on current information and gbc s current assessment  management does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material effect on gbc s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and in june issued sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
these statements establish accounting and reporting standards for certain derivative financial instruments and hedging activities including certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts and require gbc to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair market value 
gbc s existing derivative instruments are primarily designated as cash flow hedges  to hedge cash flows related to future variable rate interest payments  cash flows in foreign currencies with respect to settlement of intercompany payables by gbc s foreign subsidiaries  and foreign currency cash flows related to the financing of gbc s foreign operations 
gbc implemented both sfas no 
s and as of january  hedge accounting has been applied to all of gbc s derivative instruments except the foreign currency cash flow hedges related to intercompany loans between gbc s foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
the adjustments to gbc s balance sheet and income statement as a result of adopting these standards were not significant 
beginning in the first quarter of  gbc will implement eitf issue no 
accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
the consensus on this issue specifies when companies are required to record the cost of certain sales incentives and how the costs are to be classified in the income statement 
currently gbc records the costs of such sales incentives as selling expenses in its income statement 
upon implementation  these costs will be recorded as a reduction of sales 
there will be no change to operating income  however  operating margins will increase 
if gbc had implemented eitf in  it would have resulted in a decrease in net sales of approximately million  along with an offsetting reduction in selling  service and administrative expenses of million 
operating income would have been unchanged 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas no 
s and  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its useful life 
rather  goodwill will be subject to  at a minimum  an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
under the new rules  an acquired intangible asset would be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
gbc will be required to implement sfas no 
s and starting in january implementation of this standard will result in the elimination of approximately million annually of pre tax amortization expense related to goodwill 
upon adoption of this standard  gbc expects to record a one time pre tax charge currently estimated in the range of million related to impairment of goodwill 
related party transactions no related party transactions had a material impact on gbc s financial position  cash flow  or results of operations 
certain immaterial related party transactions are detailed in gbc s proxy statement 
also  note j to the consolidated financial statements discusses related party transactions 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies are considered to be critical to the understanding of gbc s financial statements because their application requires management judgement 
the company s reported financial results rely upon estimations and assumptions which are uncertain 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and even the best estimates may require adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns the provision for doubtful accounts is established based upon historical losses on trade receivables  the aging of customer account balances  and the credit worthiness of specific customers 
historically  gbc has not realized significant losses on trade receivables 
as discussed under credit concentration  certain of gbc s customers routinely carry significant trade receivable balances 
deterioration of the credit worthiness of such customers could have a significant negative impact on the financial results of gbc 
an allowance for potential sales returns is established as revenue is recognized 
this allowance is based upon historical trends for specific customer groups 
additionally  the company monitors the sell through information provided by significant resellers of its products 
the allowance is adjusted periodically based upon such information 
management believes that the allowance adequately provides for future returns  however  market changes and customer strategies could impact this estimate in the future 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory gbc s inventory is valued at manufactured cost or purchase cost 
an allowance is established to adjust the cost of inventory to its net realizable value 
the allowance is based upon historical and estimated future sales of specific inventory items 
changes in future demand for products or inaccurate estimates of demand for new products could have a significant impact on the company s allowance 
additionally  a decision by major resellers of gbc s products to no longer carry these products  could have a significant impact on the company s future results 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  the company reviews potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
during  a provision was established for certain assets impacted by restructuring activities 
gbc is continuing its evaluation of its operations and has announced that additional restructuring charges of up to million are likely to be recognized in a portion of any such charges may impact certain capital assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on restructuring activity announced subsequent to december  additionally  the company owns less than of a joint venture in india 
this venture had a book value of approximately million as of december  management is currently evaluating its future strategy regarding the indian market 
if the company decides to withdraw from india  it is possible that the entire investment would be written off through a non cash charge 
the majority of gbc s million of goodwill and other intangible assets relates to acquisitions in the company s office products group 
during  this goodwill was reviewed in accordance with sfas no 
the realizability test under sfas no 
is based upon the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the asset 
the results of this test concluded that the goodwill was not impaired under sfas no 
gbc is currently implementing sfas no  which uses a discounted cash flow approach 
based upon preliminary valuation results  gbc expects the goodwill associated with the office products group to be impaired 
the total pre tax impairment charge is estimated to be million 
the realizability tests under both sfas no
