overview we are a designer  developer and manufacturer of electronics  communications and technology products for the defense and intelligence markets 
specifically  we specialize in integrated passive surveillance  communications and data links  electronic countermeasures and threat simulators  and airborne imaging and scanning systems 
our products are developed for use primarily by us federal government customers and us approved foreign governments  including us defense and intelligence agencies  foreign governments agencies  and civilian agencies 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with the us federal government 
for the fiscal years ended september   and september   approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from contracts with the us federal government 
for these same periods  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were generated from contracts for which we were the prime contractor  and approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were generated from sole or single source contracts 
single source contracts are contracts under which the purchaser purchases products only from us  although other suppliers exist  while sole source contracts are contracts under which the purchaser purchases products from us that only we can supply 
the percentage reduction in sole or single source contracts is the result of classifying all revenues of st production systems  inc  which is our subsidiary that holds the assets we acquired from fel corporation in february  as derived from competitive contracts 
in addition during these time periods  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were generated from contracts relating to classified programs of the us federal government and select international contracts 
to estimate revenues for performance under us federal government fixed price and cost reimbursement contracts  including customer funded research and development  we use the percentage of completion method of accounting under which estimated revenues are determined on the basis of completion to date ie  the total contract amount multiplied by percent of performance to date less revenue value recognized in previous periods 
we record revenues under cost reimbursement contracts as costs are incurred and we include estimated earned fees in the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs 
we increase or decrease fees under certain us federal government contracts in accordance with cost or performance incentive provisions which measure actual performance against established targets or other criteria 
we include such incentive fee awards or penalties  which historically are not material  in revenues at the time the amounts can be determined reasonably 
we recognize anticipated losses at the time they become known 
our future operating results may be affected if actual contract costs incurred differ from our current estimates of total contract costs 
our revenues are primarily derived from fixed price contracts  under which we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
under fixed price contracts we assume the risk of cost overruns and receive the benefit of cost savings 
all of our us federal government contracts  whether we are the prime contractor or a subcontractor  are subject to audit and cost controls 
as a result  the us federal government contracting authorities typically have the right to object to our costs as not allowable or as unreasonable  which can result in our bearing all or a portion of these costs ourselves rather than recovering them from the us federal government 
we expense operating costs such as cost of revenues  general and administrative  independent research and development expenses  and bid and proposal costs in the period incurred 
the major components of these costs are compensation  materials  and overhead 
intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
our results of operations  particularly our revenues  gross profit and cash flow  may vary significantly from period to period depending on a number of factors  including the progress of contract performance  revenues earned on contracts  the timing of customer orders and billing of other direct costs  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the timing of government contract awards  the term of each contract that we have been awarded  foreign budget reallocations  currency fluctuations  and general political and economic conditions 
because a significant portion of our expenses  such as personnel and facilities costs  are fixed in the short term  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity  as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any period may cause significant variations in operating results 
as a result of the factors above  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues 
revenues increased  or to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the increase was due primarily to new contract awards in the communications group and the imaging group of approximately  in addition to revenues attributable to st production systems  inc  the subsidiary that holds the assets we acquired from fel corporation and which we include as part of our defense systems group  of approximately  since the date of the fel asset acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in other defense systems group revenue of  for the year ended september  we derived  directly or indirectly  of our revenue primarily from federal agencies in the intelligence community and the department of defense  compared to year ended september  for the year ended september   our four largest revenue producing contracts were the an slq a surface ship torpedo defense system  the an slq a radio terminal set  the an blq v and v  and hyperspectral imaging system which contributed of revenue 
customer funded development which is included in revenue decreased  or to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the decrease resulted from the us navy cancellation of the advanced integrated electronic warfare system  for which lockheed martin was the prime contractor 
consistent with us navy direction  all subcontractors to lockheed martin for this program were  in turn  cancelled to achieve an orderly shut down of the program 
our subcontract with lockheed martin for development of portions of the system was cancelled at this time 
for the year ended september   we derived approximately of our revenues from contracts with us approved foreign countries 
our foreign sales contracts require payment in us dollars  so we are not affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
we intend to increase the amount of foreign sales we make in the future 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased  or  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the increase was attributed to costs associated with the revenues generated by st production systems  inc  which has higher associated costs than the revenues generated in our communications and imaging groups 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the increase was due principally to the added salaries and related benefits of new employees hired for st production systems  inc of approximately  and to increases in salaries and benefits to our existing employees 
for the year ended september   internal research and development was  compared to  for the year ended september  and represented and of general and administrative expense  respectively 
interest income and interest espense 
net interest income decreased  or to net interest expense of  for the year ended september   from  of net interest income for the year ended september  the decrease was the result of lower invested balances  lower rates of return on investments during and interest expense of  incurred on our line of credit 
other income 
other income decreased  or  to  for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to sublease income of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal income tax expense 
income tax expense consists of federal and state income taxes 
income tax expense increased  or to  for the year ended september   from  for the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to increased and improved profitability in our effective tax rate was for the years ended september  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and other nondeductible expenses 
net income 
net income increased  or to  for the year ended september   from  for the year ended september  the increase was the result of an increase in revenues that was partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue 
revenue decreased  or  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the decrease primarily resulted from the completion of two significant production contracts  and the delay in receipt of planned international contracts for the defense systems  communications and imaging groups 
customer funded development  which is included in revenue  decreased  or  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the decrease in customer funded development was consistent with the reduction in revenues experienced in fiscal the customer funded development resulted primarily from the us navy integrated electronic warfare system subcontract from lockheed martin corporation and other government agency contract efforts 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased  or  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the decrease was a result of a reduction in variable costs consistent with the reduction in revenue 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the decrease was due principally to a one time accrual for severance pay of  accrued in fiscal payable to our former president and by efficiencies gained in automating infrastructure support tools  which facilitated staff reductions begun in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  for the year ended september   internal research and development was  compared to  for the year ended september  and represent and of general and administrative expenses  respectively 
during  major research efforts included a application of processing techniques and lowcost antenna technologies to derive highly accurate direction measurements on received signals  b state of the art electronic developments to perform elint data collection and processing  and c advancement in software radio technology used within our core intercept equipment 
net interest income 
net interest income increased  or  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the increase was due primarily to improved cash flow from operations and substantially improved cash collection activity resulting in lower accounts receivable and higher daily invested balances 
other income 
other income increased  or  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the increase was due to sub lease income of  received for twelve months in fiscal compared to only  for four months in fiscal income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  our effective income tax rate was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  the rate varied from the statutory rate in fiscal primarily due to state taxes 
net income 
net income decreased  or  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the decrease was the result of decreased revenues partially offset by gains in operating efficiency and interest income in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and our line of credit 
our liquidity requirements depend on a number of factors  including the timing of production under our federal government and foreign sales contracts 
we had cash and cash equivalents of  at september   as compared to  at september  the decrease was primarily due to a shift to commercial contracts  a build up in inventory in anticipation of contracts awards and accounts receivable during fiscal cash used in operating activities was approximately  for the year ended september   compared to cash provided by operating activities of approximately  for the year ended september   a decrease of approximately  the primary reasons for this decrease were an increase for our commercial contracts  which provide for billing only at the completion and delivery of those products  and government processing delays at our subsidiary st production systems  inc  which  together  resulted in an increase in unbilled receivables of approximately  and billed accounts receivable of  for the period over the comparable period  and institution of an inventory program to take advantage of quantity discounts on components and to identify and order items requiring a longer lead time for anticipated contract awards  which resulted in an increase in inventory of approximately  for the period over the comparable period 
we have no reason to believe that these unbilled receivables will not be paid 
the decrease was partially offset by increases in accounts payable of  and billings in excess of cost of  for the period over the comparable period 
the increase in inventory includes  for a program for the egyptian navy  for which lockheed martin corporation is our prime contractor 
negotiations with lockheed martin corporation on the terms and price for this contract have been completed 
we are awaiting formal authorization to proceed from lockheed martin corporation  which authorization must originate with the egyptian government 
we had been advised that final approval to proceed would be received by september   but this date has now been revised to december  although we have no reason to believe that the contract is in jeopardy  given the delays experienced  we cannot  with any certainty  plan on a contract notice to proceed until sometime after december  the remainder of the increase in the inventory is comprised of the following a two wbr threat warning system components of  b other long lead time materials and components of  and c a decrease of  of the inventory related to contracts acquired from fel  which is reported under cash used in investing activities 
the acquisition of fel materially affected the inventory at september   but we do not anticipate a material build up as a result of the acquisition in the future 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september  was  while for the year ended september  cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended september   cash provided by operating activities was generated primarily from net income of  and a decrease in receivables and unbilled contract costs of  for the year ended september   the cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of an increase in receivables  net of unbilled amounts  of  and an overdeposit of federal and state income taxes of  offset by net income of  cash used in investing activities was approximately  during the year ended september   compared to approximately  for the year ended september   an increase of approximately  the primary reasons for the increase were the acquisition of the government contracting business of fel corporation and acquisition related expenses of approximately  and the acquisition of other property and equipment for approximately  cash used in investing activities for the year ended september  was  for fiscal and fiscal  investing activity related to the acquisition of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  during the year ended september   compared to cash used in financing activities of approximately  for the year ended september   an increase of  the increase primarily resulted from the net draws and repayments on our line of credit of approximately  and receipt of proceeds from stock option exercises of approximately  cash used in financing activities for year ended was  in fiscal and fiscal  cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of payments for the purchase of treasury stock 
we entered into a line of credit and related note payable with bank of america on february  the line of credit was originally for a one year term and was for  prior to its expiration  we renewed the line of credit and the amount available under the line of credit was increased to  the line of credit is available to us to finance the performance of government contracts  to support the issuance of stand by letters of credit  and for short term working capital purposes 
the line of credit bears interest at either bank of america s base interest rate or the london interbank offering rate libor plus basis points and matures on february  the line of credit was increased to  to accommodate stand by letters of credit for anticipated international contracts 
under the line of credit  we may borrow the lesser of a defined percentage of accounts receivable under ninety days or  as of november   there was  outstanding under our line of credit 
we have given the lender a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if the lender declares amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be due  the lender could proceed against those assets 
we believe our existing funds  cash we generate by operations  and amounts available for borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs 
on november  the company sold million shares of common stock for net proceeds after costs and underwriter s commissions of  on december  the underwriter s exercised their overallotment option which provided net proceeds to the company of  from the sale of an additional  shares 
contractual obligations and commitments contractual cash obligations in thousands due in due in due in due in due in total thereafter operating leases line of credit other commercial commitments in thousands total less than year years letters of credit critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition most of our sales are generated under us federal government fixed price and cost type contracts  which require revenue recognition judgments 
revenues are primarily recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
in doing so  we make important judgments in estimating revenue  cost and progress towards completion 
we have an internal process where we monitor contract performance and cost on a monthly basis 
each quarter  management reviews  among other items  progress against schedule  project staffing  risks and issues  subcontract management  incurred and estimated costs  and disposition of prior action items 
these judgments underlie our determinations regarding overall contract value  contract profitability  and timing of revenue recognition 
revenue and cost estimates are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized  we record the effect of the revision in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known 
if the estimated cost to complete exceeds the value of the contract  a reserve for estimated loss is recognized immediately 
we have no contracts for which we currently anticipate losses 
at september   there was an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings unbilled contract costs on uncompleted contracts 
we have no reason to believe that these amounts are not realizable 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivables  and the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us 
since most of our sales are generated under us federal government contracts  our allowance for doubtful accounts is not significant 
inventories we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with the current or committed inventory levels 
inventory is generally purchased to fulfill a specific contract commitment 
as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section of md a  at september   we had a  increase in inventory related to a program for the egyptian navy 
although we have no reason to believe this contract is in jeopardy  given the delays experienced  we cannot  with any certainty  plan on a contract notice to proceed until sometime after december  income taxes we currently have deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
at september  and  we did not provide a valuation allowance as we believed it was more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized  principally based on forecasted taxable income 
research and development we include internally funded research and development costs are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements 
our applied research and development during the year ended september  focused on advanced scanning capabilities  an upgrade to a digital receiver and upgraded pulse analyzer  all of which are expected to assist in anticipated future contracts 
we expensed  and  of internally funded research and development costs during the year ended september  and  respectively 
accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred  if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement cost would be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 which supercedes sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas no 
also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the provisions of sfas no

eitf no 
requires that companies report reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue  rather than as a reduction of expenses 
the provisions of eitf no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  as we have historically accounted for reimbursements of out of pocket expenses in the manner provided for under eitf no 
the adoption of the provision of eitf no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
