results of operations net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
interest income  for purposes of analysis  is presented on a tax equivalent basis to recognize associated tax benefits 
this presentation provides a basis for comparison of yields with taxable earning assets 
the discussion on net interest income should be read in conjunction with table analysis of changes in net interest income and table consolidated average balances  interest income and expense and yields and rates 
tax equivalent net interest income for decreased million  or  from as average earning assets declined million over the prior year 
net interest margin decreased to from in provident s tax equivalent interest income decreased million  or  during the year due to the decline in average earning assets along with a basis point decrease in yield 
the decrease in yield was mainly due to a lower interest rate environment during compared to  which contributed to higher premium amortization on the acquired loan portfolio 
the average prime rate in was compared to in the decrease of million in average earning assets was in accordance with the corporation s strategic plan to reduce the wholesale segment of the balance sheet  a large portion of which is comprised of the acquired loan portfolio 
the average acquired loan portfolio declined million during this decline is related to run off associated with the lower interest rate environment that led to large refinancings  and to a million securitization during the second quarter of average investments declined million and mortgage loans held for sale declined million during the year

interest lost from non accruing loans was million compared to million in average non accrual loans for were approximately million 
this decrease was primarily associated with health care credits  a majority of which were charged off or sold during and early interest expense decreased million from resulting from a million decline in average interest bearing liabilities and lower cost of funds 
the overall cost of funds decreased basis points as total interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points mainly due to lower rate environment 
the average rate paid on borrowed funds decreased basis points during as a result of derivative transactions undertaken to insulate the bank from interest rate risks  interest income decreased by thousand and interest expense decreased by thousand  for a total increase of thousand in net interest income for the year ending december  the decrease in average interest bearing liabilities reflects a million decline in interest bearing deposits  including a million decline in brokered deposits which followed the corporation s strategy in reducing its dependence on the wholesale segment 
non interest bearing demand deposit accounts grew by million or 
the corporation experienced a million decrease in borrowed funds 
future growth in net interest income will depend upon consumer and commercial loan demand  growth in deposits and the general level of interest rates

management also considers the level of problem assets that the corporation classifies in accordance with regulatory requirements 
the provision for loan losses was million  down from million in the decrease in the provision resulted from lower charge offs  improved asset quality and a decline in loan balances of million 
net charge offs were million in compared to million in of the million in net charge offs for  million was from the acquired loan portfolio and million from syndicated loans 
as part of the corporation s strategy  less emphasis is being placed on acquired second mortgages and national syndicated credits 
the decline in charge offs is primarily attributable to the absence in of material issues in the health care portfolio  which were addressed mostly in the year the majority of the increase in charge offs in the acquired loan portfolio can be directly attributed to the bankruptcy of a third party servicer in and a thorough review of all loans delinquent days or more 
the lower loan balances are related to the wholesale segment and the corporation s decision to reduce the exposure to this portfolio 
the corporation continues to emphasize quality underwriting as well as aggressive management of charge offs and potential problem loans 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was 
in compared to 
in non accrual loans ended the year at million or of loans outstanding  a decrease of million from december  this decrease is due to fewer problem credits in the commercial business portfolio 
a further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  net charge offs and non performing assets appears on pages non interest income non interest income is principally derived from fee based services associated with deposit transaction accounts

this increase is attributable to higher account volume associated with the corporation s continued network expansion and pricing changes that are in line with the competition 
since inception of the bank s retail expansion strategy in  service charges on deposit accounts have grown from million to million 
average interest bearing demand money market deposits grew million or over last year while non interest bearing deposits increased million or 
these balance increases are the result of network expansion and continued promotion and sales efforts of retail deposit products 
commissions and fees increased modestly from  increasing thousand to million 
income from investment services increased thousand while check cashing fees declined thousand related to the company s decision to sell the check cashing business during the third quarter of investment service fees are generated from pic which offers annuities and mutual funds through an affiliation with a securities broker dealer as well as property and casualty insurance products  as agent 
other non interest income increased million over  mainly due to million increase associated with bank owned life insurance 
income from mortgage banking activities declined million to thousand from million in this decline was the result of the strategic decision made during the fourth quarter of to reposition mortgage operations by offering mortgages to retail customers through an outsourced loan origination process and to no longer seek loan production from realtors and brokers 
as a result  the mortgage lending operations of the bank s subsidiary  provident mortgage corp  was phased out during non interest expense non interest expense represent the general operating cost of the corporation and includes such things as employees salaries and benefits  bank facilities and external data processing 
provident s non interest expense of million represented a increase or million from expenses

the decline in salaries was driven by the strategic decision to phase out the mortgage operations and to outsource the item processing operations which more than offset the increase related to network expansion 
network expansion represented the full effect of new branches opened in the year as well as three new branches opened in full time equivalent employees as of december  were  compared to  last year 
the increase in occupancy costs is mainly due to additional rent and leasehold improvements related to branch network expansion noted above 
this branch network also contributed to increased furniture and equipment expense along with the upgrading of system technology 
external processing increased thousand or 
this increase is partially attributed to a increase in average account volume and the strategic decision to outsource the bank s item processing function 
although outsourcing the item processing function increased the external processing expense  compensation and benefits were reduced by a similar amount while offering the bank the ability to be more competitive within its market place 
the increase in regulatory fees was due to temporarily higher deposit assessment rates attributable to a change in the corporation s capital level at march  caused by the restatement related to the acquired loan portfolio 
other non interest expense increased million to million for the year this increase is mainly related to a charge to earnings to increase the recourse liability for loans that the corporation has securitized with the federal national mortgage association 
during the year  the corporation paid thousand to companies related to certain directors of the corporation for legal and insurance services 
efficiency ratio was impacted by lower net interest margin from higher premium amortization and increased expense of branch network expansion 
new branches take from to months to breakeven 
the benefit of network expansion has been the increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
as can be seen from table  deposit service fees have increased over the last years and represent an annual growth rate of approximately as of january   the corporation will adopt financial accounting statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no

per share on a diluted basis  in the fourth quarter of  an increase of million  or  over the million  or 
per share on a diluted basis  recorded in the same period last year 
the higher earnings were principally due to a lower provision for loan losses  higher non interest income and lower non interest expense 
tax equivalent net interest income declined million as earning assets dropped on average million and premium amortization on the acquired loan portfolio increased million over the fourth quarter of as part of the bank s strategy  gains were taken on securities held specifically to hedge the additional premium amortization 
this drop in earning assets is consistent with the corporation s strategic decision to lessen its dependence on wholesale assets and funding sources 
tax equivalent net interest income in the fourth quarter declined to million 
this decrease was mainly related to the drop in earning assets noted above and an basis point drop in net interest margin 
the decrease in the net interest margin primarily reflects the additional premium amortization recorded on the acquired loan portfolio noted above 
the corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of million during the quarter to provide for charge offs as net charge offs were million compared to million for the same quarter of total loan balances declined or million as the wholesale or non core portion of the loan portfolio declined million from december  this drop is consistent with the corporation s decision to reduce reliance on wholesale assets and focus more on core earnings growth 
non interest income increased to million 
fee income from deposit accounts increased million and net security gains totaled million compared to thousand for the same quarter of the increase in fee income from deposit accounts reflects the corporation s continued branch network expansion as well as price increases consistent with the competition 
the corporation utilizes on balance sheet assets to hedge the prepayment risks of the acquired loan portfolio 
the majority of the security gains from these on balance sheet assets were utilized for this purpose 
commissions and fees increased and generated million of income for the quarter 
investment service fees was the main contributor to the increase as these fees rose or thousand 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation made a decision to reposition its mortgage operations by offering mortgages to its retail customers through an outsourced loan origination process and no longer will seek loan production from realtors and brokers

the preparation of these financial statements requires the corporation to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis the corporation evaluates estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  non accrual loans  other than temporary investment impairments  derivative positions  pension and post retirement benefits and recourse liabilities 
provident bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the corporation believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements  investment securities  loans and allowance for loan losses  intangible assets and derivative financial instruments 
these policies may be found on pages  note summary of significant accounting policies  of the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
additionally  further discussion on the subjects of risk  assumptions and estimates can be found in the sections of management s discussion and analysis addressing credit risk management  non accrual loans  the allowance for loan losses  investment securities and interest rate sensitivity 
credit risk management much of the fundamental business of provident is based upon understanding  measuring and controlling credit risk 
credit risk entails both general risks  which are inherent in the process of lending  and risk specific to individual borrowers 
each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit loss based on historical loss experience 
for example  loans with generally low credit loss experience include home mortgage and home equity loans 
loans with medium credit loss experience are primarily secured products such as auto and marine loans 
the category with high credit loss experience includes unsecured products such as personal revolving credit 
in commercial lending  losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can vary widely from period to period and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions 
the evaluation of specific risk is a basic function of underwriting and loan administration  involving analysis of the borrower s ability to service debt as well as the value of pledged collateral 
as part of the corporation s credit risk management  less emphasis is being placed on acquired second mortgages and national syndicated credits and more emphasis is being placed on acquiring first mortgages 
first mortgages are considered to be of a higher quality and therefore improving the risk profile of the loan portfolio 
policies and procedures have been developed which specify the appropriate credit approval and monitoring for the various types of credit offered 
the bank employs prudent lending practices and adheres to regulatory requirements including loan to value ratios and legal lending limits 
procedures and risk review are modified periodically in order to reflect changing conditions and new products 
the bank s lending and loan administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower s circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral 
in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio  credit risk identification and review processes are utilized 
credit risk analysis assigns a grade to each commercial loan based upon an assessment of the borrower s financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan 
an independent loan review function tests risk assessments and determines the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
generally accepted accounting principles require creditors to evaluate the collectibility of contractually due principal and interest on commercial credits to assess the need for providing for inherent losses 
the corporation s credit procedures require monitoring of commercial credits to determine the collectibility of such credits 
if a loan is identified as impaired  it will be placed on non accrual status and recorded according to accounting guidelines 
as of december   there were million in commercial loans considered to be impaired 
the corporation securitizes second mortgage loans out of its acquired loan portfolio with federal national mortgage association fnma  and the respective securities are placed in the securities portfolio 
the retention of the securities represents a retained interest 
no gain or loss is recorded on these transactions until the securities are sold 
the securities are valued at fair market value along with the corporation s remaining securities 
credit losses do not affect the valuation due to fnma s full guarantee to the corporation for losses on loans collateralizing the securities 
these loans were securitized with full recourse back to the corporation for any credit and interest losses  collectively referred to as losses 
the recourse exposure based on the expected losses on these loans over the life of the loans is recognized as a liability 
the recourse liability is evaluated periodically for adequacy by estimating the recourse liability based on the present valuation of estimated future losses 
this estimate determines if additional amounts need to be provided to the recourse reserve to absorb losses on the securitized loans through a charge to earnings 
any loans that are determined to be losses by fnma are charged against the recourse reserve 
loans the bank offers a diversified mix of residential and commercial real estate  business and consumer loans 
as shown in table  the mix of loans outstanding is heavily consumer oriented

in addition  the bank may purchase portfolios of consumer loans from other financial institutions 
all purchased portfolios go through a thorough due diligence process prior to a purchase commitment

the bank securitized million of acquired second mortgage loans during the second quarter of and retained the securities in the investment portfolio 
all other consumer loans increased million during the year  ending the year with a balance of million 
during  the bank made a decision to exit both indirect auto and residential mortgage lending to concentrate on more profitable businesses 
most of the automobile loans were made through a network of auto dealerships in maryland  delaware  pennsylvania and virginia 
auto loans that were made through this network of dealerships ended the year at million 
during the fourth quarter of  the bank made a decision to reposition its mortgage operations by offering mortgages to its retail customers through an outsourced loan origination process 
as a result  the mortgage lending operations of its subsidiary  provident mortgage corp  were phased out in early prior to this decision  residential mortgage lending included the origination  sale and servicing of fixed and variable rate mortgage loans

the bank stresses the importance of asset quality as well as the development of new marketing programs 
during the commercial group implemented a new calling program in order to increase the awareness of provident within its market place 
commercial loans increased million  or  ending the year at million 
the corporation has made a decision to reduce the bank s exposure to national syndicated credits 
therefore  at december   national syndicated credits had an outstanding balance of million  down from million at december  the bank has minimal exposure to highly leveraged transactions hlts 
hlts are loans to borrowers for the purpose of purchasing or recapitalizing a business in which the loans represent a majority of the borrower s liabilities 
hlts totaled million as of year end  and all are performing in accordance with their contractual terms 
non performing assets and past due loans non performing assets include loans on which interest is no longer accrued  renegotiated loans and real estate and other assets that have been acquired through foreclosure or repossession 
past due loans are loans that are days or more past due as of december and still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection 
the vast majority of non residential secured closed end consumer loans that become past due days are charged off in full 
unsecured open end consumer loans will be charged off in full at days past due 
in general  charge offs of delinquent loans secured by residential real estate will be recognized when losses are reasonably estimable and probable 
no later than days delinquent  any portion of an outstanding loan balance in excess of the collateral s net realizable balance will be charged off 
loans secured by residential real estate are placed on non accrual status at days delinquent unless well secured and in the process of collection 
these loans are placed on non accrual status at days delinquent regardless of collateral value 
commercial loans are placed on non accrual status at days delinquent 
for further details on the corporation s charge off policy  consult note of the financial statements on page information with respect to non performing assets and past due loans is presented in table for the years indicated 
as shown in the table  total non accrual loans decreased million  due mainly to a decrease in commercial business non performing loans of million 
this decrease in commercial business non performing loans is due to actions taken with regard to health care credits in early this reduction in commercial business non performing loans was partially offset by an increase of million in consumer non performing loans mainly associated with consumer loans secured by real estate being placed on non accrual status at days rather than days as was the policy in prior years 
non performing assets and past due loans ended the year at million and million  respectively 
see the discussion under loans on page the ratio of total non performing loans to year end loans remained relatively flat at compared to at the end of presented below is interest income that would have been recorded on all non accrual loans if such loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and the interest income on such loans that was actually collected for the year

allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses  which is available to absorb probable inherent losses 
the allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses 
determination of the adequacy of the allowance  which is performed quarterly  is accomplished by assigning specific reserves to individually identified problem credits and general reserves  based on historic and anticipated loss experience including other qualitative factors such as economic trends  to all other loans 
management believes that the allowance at december  will be adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
based on information currently available to the corporation  management believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with gaap 
because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
the following table reflects the allowance for possible loan losses and the activity during each of the respective years

allowance for loan losses to year end loans management emphasizes loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits 
senior managers meet at least monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolios and at least quarterly with executive management to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is determined by management s evaluation of the composition and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
based upon the evaluation of credit risk  loan loss provisions in the form of charges to operations are made to bring the allowance up to a level management believes is adequate 
an analysis of the loan portfolio was performed at december   and inherent losses have been provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
during  the loan loss allowance decreased million to million at year end 
this decrease is related to the decrease in credit exposure as the total loans decreased million  million from the acquired loan portfolio 
as part of the corporation s credit risk management  less emphasis is being placed on acquired second mortgages and national syndicated credits and more emphasis is being placed on acquiring first mortgages 
first mortgages are considered to be of a higher quality and therefore improving the risk profile of the loan portfolio 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december  compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non accrual loans was at december   compared to the prior year 
the portion of the allowance that is allocated to non accrual loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral 
the increase in the consumer portion of the allowance allocation was the product of increased historical losses experienced in the acquired loan portfolio 
the corporation maintains a loan classification and review system to identify those loans with a higher than normal risk of uncollectibility 
estimated inherent losses from internally criticized loans have been provided for in determining the allowance for loan losses 
table reflects the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the various loan categories

the investment securities portfolio includes mortgage backed securities  us government securities  municipal securities and other debt securities 
in addition  the corporation invests in federal funds sold  reverse repos  mortgage loans held for sale and other short term investments referred to in total as the investment portfolio 
the strategies employed in the management of these portfolios depend upon the liquidity  interest sensitivity  yield and capital objectives and requirements of the corporation 
the treasury division executes these strategies 
the following table sets forth information concerning the bank s investment securities portfolio at december investment securities summary table dollars in thousands securities available for sale us treasury and government agencies and corporations  mortgage backed securities   municipal securities    other debt securities    total securities available for sale   total portfolio yield during  the corporation continued to enjoy a strong capital position  a high degree of liquidity  and a substantial level of core deposits 
management s principal objectives for the investment portfolio during were to maintain an appropriate level of quality  to ensure sufficient liquidity in various interest rate environments while balancing yield and quality and to increase net income by utilizing excess capital 
to successfully achieve these objectives  the corporation employed derivative and on balance sheet strategies 
total investment securities decreased million during even though the bank securitized million of purchased consumer loans during the second quarter of this decrease in investment securities is consistent with the corporation s strategic decision to focus on more core assets and less on wholesale assets 
notional amounts of derivative positions totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the corporation segregates its investment securities into three categories held to maturity  trading  and available for sale 
all securities in the available for sale category must be measured at fair market value 
the resulting gain or loss is excluded from revenue but is reflected as a change in stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
trading securities must be measured at fair value and changes included in income for the period 
securities designated as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
as of december   the corporation had no investments classified as trading securities or held to maturity 
at december   the available for sale portfolio included net unrealized losses of approximately million  compared to net unrealized losses of million at december  the corporation realized million in gains and million in losses from the sale of securities from the available for sale portfolio in as part of the bank s hedging strategy  approximately million in gains were taken to offset additional premium amortization on the acquired loan portfolio 
these sales were the result of management s continuous monitoring of the investment securities portfolio in terms of both performance and risk 
in addition  the bank wrote down one security by million because it was determined that the decline in value was other than temporary 
securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
the corporation uses criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  in addition to the reasons underlying the decline to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable or there is a lack of evidence to support realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
liquidity and sensitivity to interest rates liquidity an important component of the bank s asset liability structure is the level of liquidity available to meet the needs of customers and creditors 
traditional sources of bank liquidity include deposit growth  loan repayments  investment maturities  asset sales  borrowings and interest received 
the bank s asset liability management committee has established general guidelines for the maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity 
the committee continually monitors the amount and source of available liquidity  the time required to obtain it and its cost 
management believes the bank has sufficient liquidity to meet funding needs in the foreseeable future 
primary sources of liquidity at december  were investment securities available for sale and scheduled loan repayments 
investment securities available for sale totaled billion 
this represents of total liabilities at december   compared to at december  maturities of investment securities  as table indicates  are expected to generate million in funds in and billion  or  of the portfolio within the next five years

loan repayments are another source of liquidity 
scheduled loan repayments during the year are million  or of loans 
table presents contractual loan maturities and interest rate sensitivity at december  the cash flow from loans is expected to significantly exceed contractual maturities due to refinances and early payoffs

at year end  core deposits represented billion  or  of total liabilities and of total assets 
an important element in liquidity management is the availability of borrowed funds 
at december   short term borrowings totaled million  or  of liabilities in contrast to million  or  of liabilities at december  at december  provident had the ability to immediately raise over million in additional funds through pledging investments and loans as collateral 
another element in liquidity management is the use of brokered cds 
brokered cds at december  amounted to million  a million decrease from the same period last year 
this decrease is indicative of the corporation s decision to move away from wholesale funding to more core based funding 
the average maturity of short term borrowings at the end of the year was days 
these borrowings were fully collateralized by us government or mortgage backed securities owned by the bank 
long term borrowings consisted of variable and fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank that totaled million as of december  it is anticipated that the bank will continue to have access to the repurchase market and fed fund lines as well as short and long term variable and fixed rate funds from the federal home loan bank 
the corporation reclassified million of trust preferred securities to long term debt with an average rate of 
interest sensitivity management the nature of the banking business  which involves paying interest on deposits at varying rates and terms and charging interest on loans at other rates and terms  creates interest rate risk 
as a result  earnings are subject to fluctuations  which arise due to changes in the level and directions of interest rates 
management s objective is to minimize this risk 
measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that is performed regularly as an important component of management s analysis of the impact of changes in asset and liability portfolios 
control of the corporation s interest sensitivity position is accomplished through the structuring of the investment and funding portfolios  securitizing loans for possible sale  the use of variable rate loan products and derivatives to hedge interest rate risk 
management does not try to anticipate changes in interest rates 
its principal objective is to maintain interest margins in periods of both rising and falling rates 
traditional interest sensitivity gap analyses alone do not adequately measure an institution s exposure to changes in interest rates because gap models are not sensitive to changes in the relationship between interest rates charged or paid and do not incorporate balance sheet trends and management actions 
each of these factors can affect an institution s earnings 
accordingly  in addition to performing gap analysis  management also evaluates the impact of differing interest rates on net interest income using an earnings simulation model 
the model incorporates the factors not captured by gap analysis by projecting income over a twenty four month horizon under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
for a longer time frame perspective  the bank also employs a duration analysis  which estimates the market value sensitivity of the bank s assets  liabilities and equity 
the following table shows the anticipated effect on net interest income in both a basis point parallel shift up or down interest rate scenario 
this shift is assumed to begin on april  and evenly ramp up or down over a six month period 
the effect on net interest income would be for the year it should be noted given the interest environment at december  that a bp drop in rate is unlikely 
change in rate change in net interest income percent change in net interest income bp million 
bp million management continues to take steps to protect the bank from possible changes in interest rates 
in  these steps included lengthening the maturities on purchased funds and certificates of deposits and shortening asset maturities with interest rate swaps and caps 
management monitors the interest rate environment and employs appropriate strategies to address potential changes in interest rates 
these strategies initially lower the net interest margin but are designed to maintain an acceptable margin in a changing rate environment 
as a result of derivative transactions undertaken to insulate the bank from interest rate risks  interest income decreased by thousand and interest expense decreased by thousand  for a total increase of thousand in net interest income for the year ending december  as of january   the corporation adopted financial accounting statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

this statement required the corporation to mark to market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as january  resulting in a transition adjustment through equity and earnings depending on the type of hedging relationship 
this transition adjustment through earnings was million after tax loss 
the corporation closed all derivative instruments that did not qualify for the shortcut method under sfas no 
under the shortcut method  an entity may conclude that the change in the derivative s fair value is equal to the change in the hedged item s fair value attributable to the hedged risk  resulting in no ineffectiveness 
therefore  the adoption of fas did not adversely impact the earnings from continuing operations of the corporation in stockholders equity it is necessary for banks to maintain a sufficient level of capital in order to sustain growth  absorb unforeseen losses and meet regulatory requirements 
in addition  the current economic and regulatory climate places an increased emphasis on capital strength 
in this environment  the corporation continues to maintain a strong capital position 
the corporation is well capitalized  exceeding all regulatory requirements as of december   see note regulatory capital 
at december   total stockholders equity was million  a million decrease over the prior year 
in addition to the ordinary adjustments to stockholders equity of net income and dividends paid  additional capital of thousand was raised through the dividend reinvestment plan  million from the exercise of stock options  while capital increased by million during as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
this statement requires changes in market value  net of applicable income taxes  of the available for sale investment portfolio to be accounted for through equity 
an additional component of regulatory capital is the trust preferred securities issued in and these securities are treated as tier capital even though they are not included in stockholders equity in the consolidated statement of condition 
in the second quarter of  the corporation issued a stock dividend and all earnings per share figures have been adjusted for this dividend 
on february   the corporation entered into an agreement to repurchase approximately million shares of common stock directly from mid atlantic investors  a major stockholder 
these shares were repurchased by the corporation at a fixed price of per share 
the corporation exceeds all regulatory capital requirements as of december  the standards used by federal bank regulators to evaluate capital adequacy are the risk based capital and leverage ratio guidelines 
equity for regulatory purposes does not include market value adjustments as required by sfas no 
or sfas no 
risk based capital ratios measure core and total stockholders equity against risk weighted assets 
the corporation s core capital is equal to common stock  capital surplus and retained earnings less treasury stock 
the calculation of the corporation s total stockholders equity  for these purposes  is equal to the above plus the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations and capital securities less goodwill 
risk weighted assets are determined by applying a weighting to asset categories and certain off balance sheet commitments based on the level of credit risk inherent in the assets 
at december   the corporation s total capital ratio was compared to the minimum regulatory guideline of 
in addition  core common stockholders equity tier capital must be at least of risk weighted assets 
at year end  tier capital ratio was 
the leverage ratio represents core capital  as defined above  divided by average total assets 
guidelines for the leverage ratio require the ratio of core stockholders equity to average total assets to be to basis points above a minimum  depending on risk profiles and other factors 
the bank s leverage ratio of at december  was well in excess of this requirement
