derivatives financial instruments the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 effective february  sfas no 
requires that all derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange contracts  be recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in income or shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative qualifies as a hedge and is being used to hedge changes in fair value or cash flows 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
during fiscal  the company entered into derivative financial instruments in order to manage the overall borrowing costs associated with its senior subordinate notes 
at january   the company had an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million dollars maturing on april  the swap is a fair value hedge as it has been designated against the senior subordinate notes carrying a fixed rate of interest and converts such notes to variable rate debt 
the hedge qualifies for short cut accounting and accordingly  the interest rate swap contracts are reflected at fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet and the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged adjusted for an offsetting amount with no effect on the statement of income 
at january   the company had an interest rate cap maturing on april  and a basis swap maturing on april   both with a notional amount of million 
the interest rate cap hedges against increases in the variable rate of interest paid on the interest rate swap and the basis swap decreased the spread on the interest rate swap for months 
neither of these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting and accordingly  are reflected at fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet with the offset being recognized in income for the current period 
interest expense for the fiscal year january  has been reduced by approximately million as a result of the recognition of these derivatives 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements

 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
this issue addresses the recognition  measurement and income statement classification of consideration from a vendor to a customer in connection with the customer s purchase or promotion of the vendor s products

is not expected to have a significant effect on the financial position or the results of operation of the company 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changes the accounting treatment as it applies to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas no 
 proper accounting treatment requires annual assessment for any impairment of the carrying value of the assets based upon an estimation of the fair value of the identifiable intangible asset with an indefinite useful life  or in the case of goodwill of the reporting unit to which the goodwill pertains 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful live are no longer subject to amortization 
impairment losses  if any  arising from the initial application of sfas no 
are to be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the effective date of sfas no 
is for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has adopted sfas no 
for its fiscal year beginning february  in accordance with sfas no 
 we obtained a preliminary valuation of all of our trademarks from a third party independent valuation firm 
based on this preliminary valuation  we do not expect to record any significant impairment in the value of our trademarks upon adoption of the standard 
on october   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no
