item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements we make forward looking statements in this report within the meaning of the federal securities laws and may make forward looking statements on future filings with the securities and exchange commission and in press releases and other communications 
forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words believes  expects  anticipates  will  contemplates  would and similar expressions that contemplate future events 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect the company s operating results  including without limitation those discussed below 
these factors  risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations 
while we believe that our forward looking statements are reasonable  you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
except as required by applicable law  we do not undertake any obligation to publicly release any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report 
our quarterly financial results vary and may be adversely affected by certain relatively fixed costs 
our product revenues vary from quarter to quarter 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a fluctuation in revenues because only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenues 
our success depends in part on our ability to develop product enhancements and new products which keep pace with continuing changes in technology and customer preferences 
approximately of our revenue is derived from foreign sources 
this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies and to other international risks such as the need to comply with foreign and us export laws  and the uncertainty of certain foreign economies 
while we are expanding our focus on distributed software products  a majority of our revenue from software products is dependent on our customers continued use of ibm and ibm compatible mainframe products and on the acceptance of our pricing structure for software licenses and maintenance 
the pricing of our software licenses and maintenance is under constant pressure from customers and competitive vendors 
we regard our software as proprietary and attempt to protect it with copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
although we have not received any material claims that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to current and future products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
we depend on key employees and technical personnel 
the loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operating margins may decline 
we do not compile margin analysis other than on a segment basis 
however  we are aware that operating expenses associated with our distributed systems products are higher than those associated with our traditional mainframe products 
since we believe the best opportunities for revenue growth are in the distributed systems market  products operating margins could experience more pressure 
in addition  operating margins in the professional services business are significantly impacted by small fluctuations in revenue since most costs are fixed during any short term period 
the slowdown in the world economy could continue for an extended period and could cause customers to further delay or forego decisions to license new products or upgrades to their existing environments and this could adversely affect our operating results

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more details on the restructuring related charge 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more details on this charge 
we operate in two business segments in the technology industry products and professional services 
we evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on operating profit or loss before corporate expenses 
references to years are to fiscal years ended march software products revenue our products are designed to support four key activities within the application development process development and integration  quality assurance  production readiness and performance management of the application to optimize performance in production 
products revenue consists of software license fees and maintenance fees and comprised  and of total revenue during  and  respectively 
os product revenue mainframe revenue decreased million or during and decreased million or during revenue from distributed software products decreased million or during and decreased million or during license revenue decreased million or during to million from million during and decreased million or from million during maintenance fees decreased million or to million during from million during and increased million or from million in the decrease in maintenance fees was primarily attributable to lower license fees during both and and to market pressure on renewal rates 
the overall decline in product revenue from to was primarily attributable to decreases in license fees and maintenance fees associated with decreased customer demand for our products in north america 
the overall decline in product revenue from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand for large enterprise license agreements elas and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if foreign exchange rates in had remained consistent with  products revenue would have been million during compared to million during this represents an overall decline in constant us dollars of million  or  compared to an actual decline of million  or 
if foreign exchange rates in had remained consistent with  product revenue would have been million in compared to billion in this represents an overall decline in constant us dollars of million or compared to the actual decline of million or 
product revenue was further impacted by a decrease in customer demand for large elas which are multiyear  and often multipayment contracts 
multiyear contracts greater than million represented approximately  and  of license revenue in  and  respectively 
we support clients with product transactions covering multiple years and allowing deferred payment terms 
the contract price is allocated between maintenance for the contract term and license revenue 
all license revenue associated with these perpetual license agreements is recognized when the customer commits unconditionally to the transaction  the software products and quantities are fixed and the software has been shipped to the customer 
license revenue associated with transactions that include an option to exchange or select products in the future has been deferred and is recognized over the contract term 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance associated with all sales has been deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
products revenue by geographic location is presented in the table below in thousands year ended march  united states    european subsidiaries    other international operations    total products revenue    operating profit and expenses financial information for our products segment is as follows in thousands year ended march  revenue    operating expenses    products operating profit    the products segment generated operating margins of  and during  and  respectively 
products expenses include cost of software license fees  cost of maintenance  software product development costs  and sales and marketing expenses 
the operating margin in is fairly constant compared to the operating margin in the decrease in operating margin in was primarily a result of a decrease in software license revenue while total products costs were fairly constant 
cost of software license fees includes amortization of capitalized software  the cost of preparing and disseminating products to customers and the cost of author royalties 
the decrease in these costs in was due primarily to decreased author royalties  decreased printing and distribution costs  and decreased salary and benefits associated with lower employee headcount 
the increase in these costs in was due primarily to an increase in amortization of capitalized software products  related to the programart  caci and optimal acquisitions and increased amortization of internally capitalized projects associated with vantage formerly ecosystems  qaload  uniface  abend aid  file aid and xpediter  which were released for general availability during as a percentage of software license fees  cost of software license fees were  and in  and  respectively 
cost of maintenance consists of the cost of maintenance programmers and product support personnel and the computing  facilities and benefits costs allocated to such personnel 
the decrease in cost of maintenance in was due primarily to decreases in salaries and benefits associated with lower employee headcount  reduced travel expenses and reduced costs of corporate systems 
the increase in cost of maintenance in was due  primarily  to a higher average headcount compared to the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of maintenance fees  these costs were  and for  and  respectively 
software product development costs consist of the cost of programming personnel  the facilities  computing and benefits costs allocated to such personnel and the costs of preparing user and installation guides for our software products  less the amount of software development costs capitalized during the fiscal year 
the decrease in these costs in was due primarily to decreased salary and benefits associated with lower employee headcount  offset by a charge for leased office space no longer utilized as a result of the consolidation of development facilities and increased amortization of purchased software due to impairment charges against the purchased software associated with underperforming products acquisitions 
the increase in these costs in was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits  including severance costs  associated with a relocation of the software development lab for the vantage product line and an increase in software development staff related to the programart and caci acquisitions during capitalization of internally developed software products begins when technological feasibility of the product is established 
before the capitalization of internally developed software products  total research and development expenditures for decreased million  or  to million from million in in  total research and development costs increased million  or  to million from million in the major development projects that achieved technological feasibility during included new interactive analysis and debugging products  new fault management products  new file and data management products  new automated testing products  new systems management products  new application development products  new application performance management products  new license management products  and new windows development tools 
sales and marketing costs consist of the sales and marketing expenses associated with the products business  which include costs of direct sales  sales support and marketing staff  the facilities and benefits costs allocated to such personnel and the costs of marketing and sales incentive programs 
the decrease in sales and marketing costs from to was primarily attributable to decreased salaries and benefits associated with lower average headcount  decreased distributor commissions associated with decreased software license revenue  decreased travel expenses  and decreased advertising expenditures 
the decrease in sales and marketing costs from to was largely attributable to lower sales commissions associated with decreased product sales and to reduced advertising expenditures  offset  in part  by increased salaries and benefits due  primarily  to a higher average headcount during compared to the prior year 
the direct sales and sales support staff decreased by to  people at march   as compared to  at march  and  at march  professional services revenue we offer a broad range of information technology professional services  including business systems analysis  design and programming  software conversion and system planning and consulting 
revenue from professional services decreased million or during and increased million or during the decrease in revenue for was due  primarily  to a reduction in customer demand for professional services 
the increase from to was due  primarily  to increased market share associated with the august acquisition of data processing resources corporation dprc 
on december   we transferred our engineering services business to an unrelated third party 
professional services revenue associated with the engineering business was approximately million in  million in and million in effective january   we assigned our prime contract with a client to a company in which we have a minority equity investment and simultaneously entered into an agreement with this company to become a subcontractor providing services for the client 
professional services revenue associated with this activity was approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively 
these changes  along with the restructuring discussed below  allow us to further focus on our core professional services business 
professional services revenue by geographic location is presented in the table below in thousands year ended march  united states    european subsidiaries    other international operations    total professional services revenue    operating profit and expenses financial information for our professional services segment is as follows in thousands year ended march  revenue    operating expenses    professional services operating profit    the professional services segment generated operating margins of negative  and positive and positive during  and  respectively 
the decrease in professional services operating margin is primarily due to lower utilization  lower billing rates  and reduced customer demand for our services associated with the decline of the economy as a whole and the it sector specifically 
cost of professional services includes all costs of our professional services business  including the personnel costs of the professional  management and administrative staff of our services business and the facilities and benefits costs allocated to such personnel 
the decrease in these costs from to is due  primarily  to reductions in staff  resulting in lower salaries and benefits  reduced travel expenditures and decreased use of subcontractors for special services 
the increase in these costs from to is due  primarily  to a higher average professional staff headcount during compared to  and to increased use of subcontractors for special services 
the professional billable staff decreased  people to  people as of march  from  people at march  this compares to a decrease of  professional billable staff  to  at march  from  people at march  corporate and other expenses administrative and general expenses decreased during and increased during the decrease in administrative and general expenses during was primarily attributable to decreased charges against investments in joint ventures 
the increase in administrative and general expenses from to is primarily attributable to charges against investments in joint ventures  offset  in part  by decreases in legal costs associated with fewer acquisitions  and decreases in outside consulting services 
during  we recognized million of expense for purchased research and development costs associated with the acquisition of in process research and development from programart corporation 
interest and investment income for was million as compared to million in and million in these decreases were due to lower interest earnings on investments due to reduced interest rates  offset  in part  by increased interest related to customers deferred installments 
interest expense for was million as compared to million in and million in interest expense includes amortization of the initial financing fees and ongoing fees associated with the unutilized balance of the senior credit facility the credit facility discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
the decrease in interest expense from to was primarily attributable to the july payoff of debts previously outstanding under the credit facility 
the increase in interest expense from to was primarily attributable to interest expense associated with debt outstanding under the credit facility during we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
the income tax benefit was million in this compares to an income tax provision of million in  which represents an effective tax rate of  and an income tax provision of million in  which represents an effective tax rate of 
our effective tax rate for differs significantly from the us federal income tax rate of primarily as a result of nondeductible goodwill amortization and impairment charges 
the increase in the effective tax rate was due to nondeductible goodwill amortization associated with certain acquisitions and a shift of our state apportionment to states with higher corporate income tax rates 
restructuring and goodwill amortization and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan which will reorganize our operating divisions  primarily the professional services segment 
the plan resulted in total charges of million including million for the impairment of goodwill recognized in the acquisition of certain professional services businesses  primarily dprc 
these changes are designed to increase profitability in the future by better aligning cost structures with current market conditions 
we also incurred an impairment charge of million associated with a change in technology related to distributed products and a million charge associated with the transfer of the engineering business 
the restructuring plan includes a reduction of professional services staff at certain locations  the closing of entire professional services offices and a reduction of sales support personnel  lab technicians and related administrative and financial staff 
approximately  employees will be terminated as a result of the reorganization 
prior to year end  we communicated benefits available to employees under the plan 
a majority of affected employees are expected to be terminated during the first quarter of as of may    of the effected employees have been terminated 
in conjunction with the development of the restructuring plan  we evaluated the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the professional services business  and recorded an impairment charge related to our prior services acquisitions 
certain professional services offices acquired as part of those acquisitions have not achieved critical mass or a sustained level of profitability and were closed in april as part of the restructuring plan 
we utilized discounted cash flow analyses to value the remaining business  and recognized goodwill impairment based upon current estimated fair market values 
the following table summarizes the restructuring and impairment charges taken in in thousands completed remaining as of accrual at total charges march  march  employee termination benefits   facilities costs primarily lease abandonments   legal  consulting and outplacement costs   other restructuring charge    goodwill impairment charge   total charges    liquidity and capital resources as of march   cash and investments totaled approximately million 
our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations 
during and  we generated million and million  respectively  in operating cash flow 
the increased operating cash flow was generated  in part  from the collection of the current portion of prior years installment receivables as reflected in the decrease in total accounts receivable 
during these periods  we had capital expenditures that included property and equipment  capitalized research and software development  and purchased software of million and million  respectively 
as of february   our unsecured credit facility  which expires in august  was reduced to a total of million available 
interest may be determined on a eurodollar or base rate as defined in the credit facility basis at our option 
the credit agreement contains financial ratios and other restrictive covenants and requires commitment fees in accordance with standard banking practice 
as of march   we had no long term debt  compared to million as of march  this balance represented borrowings under the credit facility 
we believe available cash resources including the amount available under the credit facility  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
although there were no acquisitions during  we continue to evaluate business acquisition opportunities that fit our strategic plans 
we are building a new corporate headquarters office building with a current estimated cost of million for the building and an estimated million for furniture and fixtures 
cash outlays will have no impact on the results of operations until the building is ready for occupancy 
when fully occupied  in calendar  the depreciation will result in an annual expense of approximately million 
this will be partially offset by the savings realized by the consolidation of offices 
capital expenditures to date total million 
cash outlays for the next twelve months are expected to be approximately million 
currently  we intend to fund the building using cash flow from operations 
our cash flow from operations for the coming year is dependent upon the company s operating divisions meeting their projected levels of sales activity 
however  our solid base of accounts receivable installment payments that become due throughout the year provides some level of predictability to cash flow 
for a description of our payment obligations in the future  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting be used for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we have not done any acquisitions since adopting this standard 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are required to adopt this statement for the year ending march  sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and that indefinite lived intangible assets no longer be amortized over their useful lives 
we have evaluated our remaining goodwill as of april   and have determined there will be no impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement retains the impairment loss recognition and measurement requirements of sfas no 
in addition  it requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
we adopted this statement on april  it is not expected to have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
management s discussion of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our assumptions and estimates were based on the facts and circumstances known at march   future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these policies are also discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
revenue recognition a significant portion of license fee revenue is earned in connection with multiyear contracts  for which deferred payments are allowed  with installments collectible over the term of the contract 
for most of these contracts  generally accepted accounting principles provide that the license fee portion of the contract should be recognized in income upon shipment of the product  provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
as a result  revenue includes amounts for which the related cash will not be received for an extended period of time 
we have significant experience with these types of contracts over a number of years  and believe we have sufficient knowledge of our customers and products to appropriately evaluate the collectibility of the receivables 
however  changes in future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to collect these receivables 
allowance for doubtful accounts the collectibility of accounts receivable is regularly evaluated and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate for our accounts receivable balances 
in evaluating the allowance  we consider historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and the aging of outstanding receivables 
larger accounts are reviewed on a detail basis  giving consideration to collection experience and any information on the financial viability of the customer 
the allowance is reviewed and adjusted each quarter based on the best information available at the time 
capitalized software the cost of purchased and internally developed software is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and estimates of future revenues to be derived from the software could be significantly affected by future developments 
the amortization period for capitalized software is generally five years  but adverse developments could result in a shorter life or a write off based on reduced estimates of net realizable value 
impairment of goodwill goodwill is evaluated at least annually to determine whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill  we utilize a discounted cash flow approach 
this analysis requires judgment regarding discount rates  revenue growth and other variables that impact the net realizable value or fair value of the goodwill 
actual future cash flows and other assumed variables could differ from estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that we take the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on our financial position and operating performance 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy 
investments are placed with high quality issuers to preserve invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
in addition  all marketable debt securities and long term debt investments are classified as held to maturity which does not expose the consolidated statement of operations or balance sheet to fluctuations in interest rates 
the table below provides information about our investment portfolio  a significant portion of which is in municipal securities or other tax advantaged securities 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands  except interest rates fair value at fy fy fy total march  cash equivalents    average interest rate average interest rate tax equivalent investments      average interest rate average interest rate tax equivalent we offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our multiyear software sales 
installment accounts are generally receivable over a three to five year period 
as of march   non current receivables amount to million and are due approximately million  million  million  and million in each of the years ended march  through  respectively 
the fair value of non current accounts receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which the company would finance a similar transaction 
at march   the fair value of such receivables is approximately million  compared to million at march  each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated million negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  compared to a million negative impact at march  a change in interest rates will have no impact on cash flows or net income associated with non current accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due to or from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
we operate in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus we have unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
the table below provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts at march  the table presents the value of the contracts in us dollars at the contract maturity date and the fair value of the contracts at march  in thousands  except contract rates contract maturity forward fair date in date in contract position in value at rate us dollars march  forward sales australian dollar march april canadian dollar march april japanese yen march april   norwegian krone march april singapore dollar march april   swedish krona march april swiss franc march april   british pound march april 
  forward purchases euro dollar march april   approximately of our revenue is derived from foreign sources 
this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies related to the fair value of foreign assets and liabilities  net income and cash flows
