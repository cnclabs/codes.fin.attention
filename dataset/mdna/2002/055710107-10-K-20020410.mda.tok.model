item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertanties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by the company and discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed below in the section entitled forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
financial restatement the company s financial statements for the month transition period ended december  the transition period  and for the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended december  fiscal  have been restated due to adoption of a change in the company s revenue recognition policy related to revenue from associated centers 
see revenue recognition below 
see also consolidated statements of operations on pages f  and footnote  quarterly results  on page f for the transition period  the restatement reflects a reduction in revenues of  a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  and an increase in net loss for the period of  or  compared to the net loss previously reported 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  financing operations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition britesmile recognizes revenue related to retail products at the time such products are sold to customers 
britesmile recognizes revenue at company operated centers at the time a whitening procedure is performed 
britesmile records deferred revenue at the time of sale of key cards and access codes to associated centers 
deferred revenue is recorded for the full value of the key cards and access codes at the time of sale only if britesmile is contractually entitled to invoice the associated center for the full value of the sale and the associated center is obligated to pay such invoice  thereby creating a corresponding account receivable 
deferred revenue is subsequently recognized as revenue over the estimated period that the whitening procedures which can be performed via the key cards and access codes are expected to be used  currently days from the date of shipment 
a material change to the estimated time period over which the key cards and access codes are used could have a significant impact on britesmile s revenue in the period of change as well as future periods 
britesmile s policy is not to accept any return of key cards or access codes during the course of the agreement with an associated center  however  it does provide credits to the ultimate whitening customer for a whitening guarantee 
britesmile recognizes those credits by reducing its revenue 
bad debt britesmile maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of accounts receivable including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of britesmile s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory britesmile is required to state its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
britesmile writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  as well as for damaged goods 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
property  equipment and improvements carrying value near recoverability estimate britesmile evaluates its property  equipment and improvements for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
management determined that impairment indicators did exist in fiscal based upon continued operating losses and negative cash flow 
britesmile s current estimates of recoverability for its property  equipment and improvements indicated those assets would not have been recoverable if management s estimates of future cash flows had been lower than its current estimate 
britesmile s recoverability estimates are based on current revenue levels continuing to grow at approximately per annum compared to an historical growth rate of approximately 
britesmile has further assumed that operating costs will increase by approximately per annum compared to an historical increase of approximately 
the company completed a major restructuring of its cost structure in the fourth quarter of fiscal with plans to reduce operating costs by approximately million per year compared to fiscal had britesmile s recoverability estimates resulted in a determination that these assets were not recoverable  britesmile would have recognized an impairment loss in fiscal store closures during fiscal and the transition period  britesmile recorded significant reserves in connection with store closures 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations  primarily property leases 
although the company does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs related to the closures may differ from these estimates 
legal contingencies britesmile is currently a party to certain legal action 
as discussed in note of britesmile s consolidated financial statements  management does not believe that current pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on britesmile s consolidated financial position 
this conclusion has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling britesmile s defense in the matter 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in management s assumptions and the effectiveness of britesmile s strategies related to these legal actions 
britesmile recognizes the costs of legal services in the periods incurred 
as of december   no amounts had been accrued for costs related to these legal actions

in consideration for the guarantors commitment  the company issued to the guarantors five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock of the company at an exercise price of per share 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required  or that it will be available on terms that are acceptable to the company

accordingly  the company may choose to defer capital expenditure plans or further reduce operating expenditures

the company anticipates usual inflationary increases in the price of its products and does not intend to pass these increases along to its customers  primarily as a result of other operating efficiencies gained through changing the sourcing of certain of its products 
in general  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality the company believes that its business follows seasonal trends due to the closing of some associated center dental offices in july and august  and again in november and december  for vacations 
as a result  the company s sales performance could potentially be affected 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and section e of the securities exchange act 
these statements relate to the company s expectations  hopes  beliefs  anticipations  commitments  intentions and strategies regarding the future 
they may be identified by the use of words or phrases such as believes  expects  anticipates  should  plans  estimates  and potential  among others 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the company s financial performance  revenue and expense levels in the future and the sufficiency of its existing assets to fund future operations and capital spending needs 
actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in such forward looking statements 
the company believes that many of the risks set forth here and in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission are part of doing business in the industry in which the company operates and competes and will likely be present in all periods reported 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report and the company assumes no obligation to update them or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in such forward looking statements 
among others  risks and uncertainties that may affect the business  financial condition  performance  development  and results of operations of the company include we have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our likelihood of success 
we have only manufactured and distributed our bs since november  the bs since november and the bspb since may we opened our first center in walnut creek  california in february  and britesmile associated centers began performing latw procedures in april therefore  we have a limited relevant operating history upon which to evaluate the likelihood of our success 
investors must evaluate the likelihood of our success in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the operation and expansion of a new business and the development and marketing of new products 
we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks and difficulties 
our failure to address any of these risks or difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have a history of losses and accumulated deficit and this trend of losses may continue in the future 
for the fiscal  we had a net loss of million  for the transition period ended december  we had a net loss of million  and for fiscal we had a net loss of million 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our ability to reach and sustain profitability will depend  in part  upon the successful marketing of our existing services and products and the successful and timely introduction of new services and products 
we anticipate that net losses will continue for the foreseeable future 
we can give no assurances that we will achieve profitability or  if achieved  that we will sustain profitability 
our success will depend on acceptance of our latw process and post whitening maintenance products 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from our latw procedures  a relatively new teeth whitening concept for consumers 
we have also begun to market britesmile brand toothpaste  electric toothbrushes and post whitening procedure touchup kits through our centers and associated centers 
we expect to add other oral care accessories under the britesmile brand name to our line of retail products  which currently include mouthwash  toothbrushes  chewing gum  and travel kits 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to successfully encourage consumers  dentists and dental office employees to switch from traditional and less expensive bleaching tray whitening methods to our latw system  and on our ability to successfully market our line of post whitening maintenance products 
there can be no assurance that consumers will accept our procedure or products 
typically  medical and dental insurance policies do not cover teeth whitening procedures  including the company s latw procedure  or whitening maintenance products  which may have an adverse impact upon the market acceptance of our products and services 
our success will depend on our ability to update our technology to remain competitive 
the dental device and supply industry is subject to technological change 
as technological changes occur in the marketplace  we may have to modify our products in order to become or remain competitive or to ensure that our products do not become obsolete 
while we are continuing our research and development efforts to improve our current latw systems in order to strengthen our competitive advantage  we cannot assure that we will successfully implement technological improvements to our latw systems on a timely basis  or at all 
if we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to government requirements  market trends or customer demands  or if there are any significant delays in product development or introduction  our revenues and profit margins may decline which could adversely affect our cash flows  liquidity and operating results 
we may have problems financing our future growth 
our growth strategy includes investment in and expansion of associated centers throughout the united states and internationally  increasing awareness of the britesmile brand and developing and marketing our brand name retail products 
to finance our prior growth we have sold debt and equity securities  however  additional funds are needed in the future for continued expansion 
we cannot assure that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it will be on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if needed funds are not available  we may be required to close existing centers  and or limit or forego the establishment of new associated centers and the development of new products  or limit the scope of our current operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be required to take other actions that may lessen the value of our common stock  including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us 
raising the needed funds through the sale of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock may result in dilution to current stockholders 
we are subject to competition 
the market for teeth whitening products and services is highly competitive 
competition in the market for teeth whitening products and services may intensify in the future 
numerous well established companies and smaller entrepreneurial companies are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our products and services 
in addition  many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  operational and marketing resources 
teeth whitening products and services offered by our competitors include traditional and often less expensive bleaching tray methods and other forms of heat or light activated curing methods 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors in developing  marketing and distributing our services and products  which could result in the loss of customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competitive pressures may also force prices for teeth whitening services down and such price reductions may adversely affect our potential future revenue 
we are susceptible to product liability suits and if a lawsuit is brought against us it could result in us having to pay large legal expenses and or judgments 
although no lawsuits have been filed against the company relating to our products or services  because of the nature of the dental device industry  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to such claims in the future 
our products come into contact with vulnerable areas of the human body  such as the mouth  tongue  teeth and gums  and  therefore  the sale and support of dental products makes us susceptible to the risk of such claims 
a successful product liability claim or claim arising as a result of use of our products or services brought against us  or the negative publicity brought up by such claim  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we maintain product liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence and million per year 
while we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage that is reasonable and customary for our business  we cannot assure that the amount of insurance will be adequate to satisfy claims made against us in the future  or that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
future growth may place strains on our managerial  operational and financial resources and we may be unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
if we grow as expected  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources may occur 
further  as the number of associated centers  customers  advertisers and other business partners grows  we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various center dentists  associated center dentists  customers  strategic partners and other third parties 
future growth or increase in the number of our strategic relationships may strain our managerial  operational and financial resources  thereby inhibiting our ability to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our business plan 
in addition  our future success will also depend on our ability to expand our sales and marketing organization and our support organization commensurate with the growth of our business 
we may experience shortages of the supplies we need because we do not have long term agreements with suppliers 
our success depends to a large degree on our ability to provide our affiliated dentists with our latw systems  and a sufficient supply of teeth whitening gels and maintenance products 
since our bs was first used commercially  we have relied upon manufacturing and supply agreements with multiple suppliers and a single manufacturer of our latw systems 
effective april   the company s latw systems are manufactured by peak industries  frederick  colorado  pursuant to a new agreement between the company and peak 
we have no long term purchase contracts or other contractual assurance of continued supply  pricing or access to new products 
while we believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and our manufacturer  if we are unable to extend or secure manufacturing services or to obtain component parts or finished products from one or more key vendors on a timely basis and on acceptable commercial terms  our results of operations could be seriously harmed 
we need to successfully manage our growth in order for the addition of any new associated centers to be profitable 
even though we have grown significantly in the past two years in terms of numbers of centers and associated centers opened and in operation  we may not be able to achieve profitable operations at the centers 
we currently have centers in operation 
we have no current plans to open additional centers 
our future growth primarily depends upon expansion of the number of our associated centers 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in expanding the number of associated centers  or that such associated centers will achieve sales levels satisfactory to us
