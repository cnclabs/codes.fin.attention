critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  long lived assets and the review of their impairment  self insurance reserves  and sales return reserve 
the estimate recorded for self insurance reserves for workers compensation and general liabilities is the company s most critical estimate and assumption used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the self insurance liability is determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of the medical profession increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
forward looking statements and factors affecting future performance this report includes a number of forward looking statements  which reflect the company s current beliefs and estimates with respect to future events and the company s future financial performance  operations and competitive position 
the words expect  anticipate  estimate  believe  looking ahead  forecast  plan and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
the company s continued success depends  in part  upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations  to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth 
future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict 
the forward looking statements that are contained in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from historical results or current expectations 
these factors include  without limitation  a general deterioration in economic trends  ongoing competitive pressures in the apparel industry  the company s ability to obtain acceptable store locations  the company s ability to continue to purchase attractive name brand merchandise at desirable discounts  the company s ability to successfully open distribution centers in south carolina and southern california in a timely and cost effective manner  the company s ability to successfully extend its geographic reach into new markets  unseasonable weather trends  changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences in apparel or home related merchandise  the company s ability to attract and retain the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies  the company s ability to implement and integrate various new systems and technologies  and greater than planned costs 
in addition  the company s corporate headquarters  one of its distribution centers and of its stores are located in california 
therefore  a downturn in the california economy or a major natural disaster there could significantly affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
in addition to the above factors  the apparel industry is highly seasonal 
the combined sales of the company for the third quarter and fourth holiday fiscal quarter are historically higher than the combined sales for the first two fiscal quarters 
the company has realized a significant portion of its profits in each fiscal year during the fourth quarter 
if intensified price competition  lower than anticipated consumer demand or other factors were to occur during the third and fourth quarters  and in particular during the fourth quarter  the company s fiscal year results could be adversely affected

these lease payments will begin upon completion of construction of each new distribution center
