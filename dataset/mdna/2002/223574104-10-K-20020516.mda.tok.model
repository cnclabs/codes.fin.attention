the commitment for funding for the investment and the conversion of the indebtedness is anticipated to come primarily from the current chairman of covista s board or his designee s and is subject to shareholder s approval at the next annual meeting  or a special meeting of shareholders to be convened for such purpose 
as of may    of cash was received from the chairman of covista s board in exchange for debt 
finally  the company is planning to obtain a line of credit from a bank 
if such line of credit is not obtained  the chairman of the board has committed to loaning million to the company through at least the second quarter of fiscal cash flow statement the cash flow statement of covista for fiscal indicated a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of approximately  non cash adjustments depreciation  amortization  reserve for bad debt  non cash compensation expense  and gain on investments  of approximately  and net changes in assets and liabilities of approximately  added back to the net loss of approximately  resulted in net cash used by operations of approximately  cash used in investing activities amounted to approximately  of which approximately  were used for the purchase of capital additions and approximately  was used for the purchase of additional circuits to build out the network  the proceeds from sale investments of approximately  a note from capsule communications  a related party  of  and payment for prepaid network capacity of  these additions were partially offset by proceeds from and the sale of fixed assets of approximately  the cash used in financing activities of approximately  consisted primarily of the repayment of bank borrowings of approximately  offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options of approximately  proceeds from the issuance of common stock of  a note payable to a related party of accounts receivable the company has entered into offset arrangements with certain customers  who are also vendors  allowing for the ability to offset receivables against the company s payable balances 
the retail segment of covista experience an approximate accounts receivable turnover of days  while the wholesale segment has an accounts receivable turnover of days 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company s revenues  net of sales discounts  are recognized in the period in which the service is provided  based on the number of minutes of telecommunications traffic carried  and a rate per minute 
access and other service fees charged to customers  typically monthly  are recognized in the period in which service is provided 
deferred line installation costs deferred line installation costs are costs incurred by the covista for new facilities and costs incurred for connections from within the covista s network to the network of other telecommunication suppliers such as verizon  mfs  gte and other carriers 
amortization of these line installation costs is provided using the straight line method over the contract life of the lines ranging from three to five years 
long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of by evaluating the carrying value of its long lived assets in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying businesses annually and when indications of impairment are present 
long lived assets to be disposed of  if any  are evaluated in relation to the net realizable value 
if impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
the discount rate applied to these cash flows is based on the company s weighted average cost of capital 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  the difference will be charged to the results of operations in the period that the impairment occurred 
based on the company s analysis of future undiscounted cash flows which are in excess of the carrying value of its long lived assets  there does not appear to be an impairment as of january  capital expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal totaled approximately  and were financed from funds provided from covista s working capital  sale and lease back of two switches  and a private sale of equity and a loan 
the capital expenditures were used for the addition of the ip network of approximately  upgrades to covista s switches and switch sites of approximately  software and hardware upgrades to covista s computer network of approximately  and furniture  fixtures and equipment for new sales offices of approximately  and other furniture and fixtures of  capital expenditures for fiscal are estimated at approximately  and are expected to be financed from funds provided from operations  and a cash infusion of  from a related party of covista 
inflation since inflation has slowed in recent years  covista does not believe that its business has been materially affected by the relatively modest rate of price increases in the economy 
however  pressures in the industry to reduce prices  which have impacted covista in the past  are expected to continue 
also the telecommunications industry has recently experienced the failure of several businesses  some of which are covista s wholesale customer and suppliers 
these failures not only have affected covista s fy results  but may impact future results 
covista continues to seek improvements in operations and efficiency through capital expenditures 
expenditures to improve the signaling system  information systems and the local area network are expected to result in operating costs savings  which could partially offset any future cost increases 
environmental matters covista is not a party to any legal proceedings or the subject of any claim regarding environmental matters generally incidental to its business 
in the opinion of management  compliance with the present environmental protection laws should not have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition of covista item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
covista s cash and investments exceed long term debt  therefore  the exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the marketable securities held by covista 
covista only invests in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
covista does not hold any derivatives related to its interest rate exposure 
covista also maintains long term debt at fixed rates 
due to the nature and amounts of covista s note payable  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect in covista s results of operations over the next fiscal year 
covista s exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates is also immaterial to the consolidated statements as a whole
