during  the trust sold the real estate assets of lakeshore hospital for net cash proceeds of  since the book value of this facility was reduced to zero in a prior year  the net cash proceeds received were recorded as a gain and netted against the provision for investment loss 
also during  a provision for investment loss of million was recorded on meridell achievement center  inc  a behavioral health services facility operated by  and formerly leased from the trust  by a wholly owned subsidiary of uhs pursuant to the terms of a lease that expired in december  in measuring the provision for investment loss in  the trust estimated fair value by discounting using the trust s internal hurdle rate expected future cash flows  consisting of estimated future rental payments and residual value 
during the second quarter of  the wholly owned subsidiary of uhs exercised its option pursuant to the lease to purchase the leased property upon the december  expiration of the initial lease 
pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement  three appraisals were obtained to determine the fair market value of the property and accordingly  the sale price was determined to be  this sale was completed in december  resulting in a gain of approximately million which is included in the trust s results of operations 
also during  the trust recorded a provision for investment loss of million to reflect its share of an asset impairment charge recorded at a limited liability company in which the trust owns a non controlling interest resulting from declines in the performance of a medical office complex located in phoenix  arizona 
in measuring the provision for investment loss of the limited liability company in  management of the trust concluded that the estimated fair value of the real property calculated by discounting expected future cash flows  consisting of estimated future rental payments and residual value did not exceed the mortgage  that is non recourse to the trust  held on the property by a third party lending institution 
accordingly  the million charge was recorded during the fourth quarter of to reduce the trust s investment in this limited liability company to zero 
included in the trust s financial results was million in  million in and million in  of income generated from the trust s ownership of equity interests in limited liability companies which own medical office buildings in arizona  california  kentucky  new mexico  nevada and maine see note to the consolidated financial statements

ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the trust s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
in june of  the trust issued million additional shares of beneficial interest at per share generating net proceeds of million to the trust 
these proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the trust s million revolving credit facility thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing the ffo from june through december of general the average occupancy rate of a hospital is affected by a number of factors  including the number of physicians using the hospital  changes in the number of beds  the composition and size of the population of the community in which the hospital is located  general and local economic conditions  variations in local medical and surgical practices and the degree of outpatient use of the hospital services 
a significant portion of the revenues from the trust s hospital facilities are derived from the medicare and medicaid programs as well as managed care plans which include health maintenance organizations hmos and preferred provider organizations ppos 
generally  the trust s hospital facilities continue to experience an increase in revenues attributable to managed care payors as pressures to control healthcare costs  as well as a shift away from traditional medicare to medicare managed care plans  have resulted in an increase in the number of patients whose healthcare coverage is provided under managed care plans 
typically  the trust s hospital facilities receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than from traditional indemnity insurers 
however  during the past year  many of the trust s hospital facilities secured price increases from many of its commercial payors including managed care companies 
the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of the trust s facilities vary among the markets in which the trust s facilities operate 
outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities  outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical centers also impact the healthcare marketplace 
many of the trust s facilities continue to experience an increase in outpatient revenues which is primarily the result of advances in medical technologies and pharmaceutical improvements  which allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis  and increased pressure from medicare  medicaid  hmos  ppos and insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
the hospital industry in the united states  as well as the trust s hospital facilities  continue to have significant unused capacity which has created substantial competition for patients 
inpatient utilization continues to be negatively affected by payor required  pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
the trust expects its hospital facilities to continue to experience increased competition and admission constraints 
the federal government makes payments to participating hospitals under its medicare program based on various formulas 
the operators of the trust s general acute care hospitals are subject to a prospective payment system pps 
for inpatient services  pps pays acute care hospitals a predetermined amount per diagnostic related group drg based upon a hospital s location and the patient s diagnosis 
behavioral health facilities  which are excluded from the inpatient services pps  are cost reimbursed by the medicare program  but are generally subject to a per discharge ceiling  calculated based on an annual allowable rate of increase over the hospital s base year amount under the medicare laws and regulations 
beginning august  under a new outpatient prospective payment system opps mandated by the balanced budget act of bba  both general acute and behavioral health hospitals outpatient services are paid a predetermined amount per ambulatory payment classification based upon a hospital s location and the procedures performed 
the medicare  medicaid and schip balanced budget refinement act of bbra of included transitional corridor payments through fiscal year  which provide some financial relief for any hospital that generally incurs a reduction to its medicare outpatient reimbursement under the new opps 
bbra of required that the health care financing administration  now known as the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  develop an inpatient psychiatric per diem prospective payment system effective for the federal fiscal year beginning october   however  it is possible that the implementation may be delayed 
upon implementation  this new prospective payment system will replace the current inpatient psychiatric payment system 
in addition to the trends described above that continue to have an impact on the operating results of the trust s hospital facilities  there are a number of other more general factors affecting the operators of the trust s facilities 
bba called for the government to trim the growth of federal spending on medicare by billion and on medicaid by billion over the following years 
bba also called for reductions in the future rate of increases to payments made to hospitals and reduced the amount of reimbursement for outpatient services  bad debt expense and capital costs 
some of these reductions were reversed with the passage on december  of the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of bipa which  among other things  increased medicare and medicaid payments to healthcare providers by billion over years with approximately billion of this amount targeted for hospitals and billion for managed care payors 
these increased reimbursements to hospitals pursuant to the terms of bipa commenced in april  bba established the annual update for medicare at market basket minus in both fiscal years october  and through september  and and bipa revised the update at the full market basket in fiscal year and market basket minus 
in fiscal years and additionally  bba reduced reimbursement to hospitals for medicare bad debts to and bipa increased the reimbursement to 
it is possible that future federal budgets will contain certain further reductions or increases in the rate of increase of medicare and medicaid spending 
the trust can provide no assurance that the reductions in the pps update  and other changes required by bba  will not adversely affect the operators of the trust s facilities 
however  within certain limits  a hospital can manage its costs  and  to the extent this is done effectively  a hospital may benefit from the drg system 
however  many hospital operating costs are incurred in order to satisfy licensing laws  standards of the joint commission on the accreditation of healthcare organizations jcaho and quality of care concerns 
in addition  hospital costs are affected by the level of patient acuity  occupancy rates and local physician practice patterns  including length of stay  judgments and number and type of tests and procedures ordered 
a hospital s ability to control or influence these factors which affect costs is  in many cases  limited 
a large portion of the trust s non hospital properties consist of medical office buildings which are located either close to or on the campuses of hospital facilities 
these properties are either directly or indirectly affected by the factors discussed above as well as general real estate factors such as the supply and demand of office space and market rental rates 
market risks associated with financial instruments the trust s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic interest rates  a portion of the trust s debt is fixed rate accomplished by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements are contracts that require the trust to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating interest rate over the life of the agreements 
the floating rates are based on libor and the fixed rates are determined upon commencement of the swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements do not constitute positions independent of the underlying exposures

the trust is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties to its financial instruments
