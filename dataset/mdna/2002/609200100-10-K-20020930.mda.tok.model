item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction during fiscal  the company recorded million  or per diluted share  in special charges related to operational changes in its disney california adventure project 
the company also recorded inventory and fixed asset write downs during fiscal totaling million  or per diluted share  as a result of lowering its sales volume growth projections early in the fiscal year 
the adjusted figures discussed throughout this report exclude these special charges and asset write downs  as well as inventory step up charges associated with business acquisitions and other non recurring gains and losses for all periods presented 
the company has included these adjusted figures in its discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to provide a clearer picture of its ongoing operating performance as compared to its reported results 
the adjusted figures should not be considered an alternative to financial statements required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
forward looking statements this discussion and other information provided from time to time by the company contain historical information as well as forward looking statements about the company  the premium wine industry  and general business and economic conditions 
such forward looking statements include  for example  projections or predictions about the company s future growth  consumer demand for its wines  including new brands and brand extensions  margin trends  anticipated future investment in vineyards and other capital projects  the premium wine grape market  and the premium wine industry generally 
actual results may differ materially from the company s present expectations 
among other things  a soft economy  a downturn in the travel and entertainment sector  reduced consumer spending  or changes in consumer preferences could reduce demand for the company s wines 
similarly  increased competition or changes in tourism to our california properties could affect the company s volume and revenue growth outlook 
the supply and price of grapes  the company s most important raw material  are beyond the company s control 
a shortage of grapes might constrict the supply of wine available for sale and cause higher grape costs that put more pressure on gross profit margins 
a surplus of grapes might allow for greater sales and lower grape costs  but it might also result in more competition and pressure on selling prices or marketing spending 
interest rates and other business and economic conditions could increase significantly the cost and risks of projected capital spending 
for these and other reasons  no forward looking statement by the company can nor should be taken as a guarantee of what will happen in the future 
key accounting matters the company has recorded inventory step up charges associated with its acquisition of arrowood vineyards winery arrowood and its acquisition of an interest in tenuta dell ornellaia ornellaia 
under purchase accounting  the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the acquired company based on their estimated fair market values at the time of the transaction 
when the inventory acquired is subsequently sold in the normal course of business  costs of the inventory are charged to cost of goods sold  including the amount of the inventory step up the difference between the original book value of the inventory and the fair market value of the inventory upon acquisition 
the inventory step up charges reduce the company s reported net income 
inventory step up charges related to arrowood are recorded in cost of goods sold  while those related to ornellaia are recorded in equity in net income of joint ventures 
the company s joint venture interests are accounted for as investments under the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  the company s share of its joint ventures results is reflected in equity in net income of joint ventures and investments in joint ventures on the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
the company also imports wines under importing and marketing agreements with certain of its joint ventures and their affiliates 
under the terms of these agreements  the company purchases wine for resale in the united states and europe 
revenues and expenses related to importing and selling these wines are included in the appropriate sections of the consolidated statements of income 
the company has stock option plans and an employee stock purchase plan 
the company accounts for these plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related interpretations

prior period financial statements have been restated to reflect this change in classification 
for further details of this change in classification  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances  its historic write off experience  and the financial condition of its customers 
changes in the financial condition of the company s major customers could result in significant accounts receivable write offs 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  which is based on historic experience and assumptions about market conditions and expected future demand 
if actual market conditions and future demand are less favorable than projected  inventory write downs may be required 
the company records a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of the available evidence  the company concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax assets would be charged to income if the company determined that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future 
the company has goodwill and licenses associated with business acquisitions 
the company reviews these assets for impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying value 
if the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying value  then an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
the company s liabilities for its self insured medical plan and high deductible workers compensation plan are estimated based on the company s historic claims experience  estimated future claims costs  and other factors 
changes in key assumptions may occur in future periods  which could result in changes to related insurance costs 
the company is subject to litigation and other contingencies in the ordinary course of business 
liabilities related to commitments and contingencies are recognized when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
seasonality and quarterly results the company has historically experienced and expects to continue experiencing seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in its net revenues  gross profit  equity income from joint ventures  and net income 
sales volume tends to increase in advance of holiday periods  before price increases go into effect  and during promotional periods  which generally last for one month 
sales volume tends to decrease if distributors begin a quarter with larger than normal inventory levels 
the timing of releases for certain luxury wines can also have a significant impact on quarterly results

seasonal cash requirements increase just after harvest in the fall as a result of contract grape payments and  to a lesser degree  due to the large seasonal work force employed in both the vineyards and wineries during harvest 
also  some grape contracts include a deferral of a portion of the payment obligations until april of the following calendar year  resulting in significant cash payments on march of each year
