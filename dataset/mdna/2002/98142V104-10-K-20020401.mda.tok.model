item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presented below relates to the operations of world airways as reflected in its financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is an explanation of the company s critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
accounting for aircraft maintenance costs the company s maintenance costs are prone to greater fluctuations from year to year under the direct expense method of accounting as opposed to the accrual method of accounting  which was used prior to the change in accounting effective january  under the direct expense method  costs are recognized as maintenance services are performed and as nonrefundable maintenance payments required by lease agreements and maintenance contracts with outside maintenance providers become due 
the company s aircraft are maintained by outside maintenance providers 
in certain cases  aircraft maintenance costs are covered by maintenance reserve payments made to the lessors of the company s aircraft 
in these cases  the company is required to set aside funds to cover future maintenance work 
this is done by remitting these non refundable amounts to the lessors each month 
after qualifying maintenance is performed and paid for  the company is reimbursed for amounts paid from the funds held by the lessors 
the result of this arrangement is that the company recognizes maintenance costs each month based on the amount of the maintenance reserves required to be paid to its lessors usually based on a rate per hour flown 
in other cases  maintenance work does not qualify for reimbursement from lessor reserves 
this may be due to the type of maintenance performed or whether the aircraft component being maintained is covered by a lease agreement 
for maintenance that is not covered by lessor reserves  the company recognizes the costs when maintenance services are performed and the costs are determinable 
therefore  these maintenance costs will fluctuate from period to period as scheduled maintenance work comes due or in the event unscheduled maintenance work must be performed 
it is also important to note that aggregate maintenance reserves paid to each of the company s lessors may not be sufficient to cover actual maintenance costs incurred 
in these cases  the company incurs the cost of any shortfall when the maintenance services are performed and the costs are determinable 
accounting for the stabilization act grant the fourth quarter results include the benefit of a million grant the company received from the federal government under the stabilization act to offset losses resulting from the terrorist attacks on the united states 
this grant is included as a credit to operating expenses in the statement of operations 
under the stabilization act  the company is entitled to receive as a grant the lesser of its actual direct and incremental losses for the period september  to december  or its maximum allocation of grant funds as determined by the dot 
the company does not know its maximum allocation of grant funds  as the dot has not finalized its allocations 
however  the company believes that the dot would not have disbursed grant funds to the company in excess of its maximum allocation 
in determining the grant amount to recognize in the fourth quarter of  the company compared the million actually received to its calculation of actual direct and incremental losses incurred through december  this comparison was done separately for the company s passenger and cargo results  because the company has been required to report information in its filings to the dot under the stabilization act in this manner  and in the aggregate for the combined passenger and cargo results 
the million of grant funds received  which was received on the company s passenger filings  exceed the actual direct and incremental passenger losses 
however  grant funds received are less than the company s calculation of actual direct and incremental losses incurred through december  on an aggregate basis 
the company believes that it will not be required to return any of the funds received under the passenger filings  because its aggregate direct and incremental losses exceed the million of grant funds received 
the company believes that it may receive a maximum of million of additional grant funds in  based on the excess of actual direct and incremental losses over the million of grant funds received through december  however  no additional grants may be received or the company may have to return grant funds already received based on the dot s final determination of the above described amounts 
due to the uncertainty of the maximum allocation amount determined by the dot and the fact that the dot has not completed its final review of the company s calculation of actual direct and incremental losses  the company determined that it would not be appropriate to accrue the benefit of any additional grant funds until their receipt is certain 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
to the extent that the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from an asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss will be recognized based on the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its estimated fair market value 
if the company determines that assets  such as aircraft parts  are no longer needed to support operations  they are reclassified to assets held for sale and are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
net realizable value is determined based on the estimated fair value measured by using a current selling price for similar assets less estimated selling costs 
changes in industry capacity  the manner of use by the company of its assets  and demand for air transportation can significantly impact fair value 
results of operations general the company incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  and a net loss of million for the year ended december  results for include the benefit of a million grant received from the federal government under the stabilization act 
results for include a million benefit resulting from the cumulative effect of an accounting change for certain aircraft maintenance costs and a million benefit relating to the settlement of a contract dispute with a former customer 
results for include a million extraordinary gain on the early extinguishment of debt 
had the company not received the benefit of these unusual items  the company s net losses would have been million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the following table provides statistical data  used by management in evaluating the operating performance of the company  for the years ended december    and year ended december  revenue block hours full service passenger    full service cargo acmi passenger    acmi cargo    miscellaneous total    aircraft at year end average available aircraft per day average daily utilization block hours flown per day per aircraft adverse impact of terrorist attacks on september   the faa ordered all civilian aircraft operating in us airspace grounded due to terrorist attacks 
on september   president bush signed into law the air transportation safety and system stabilization act stabilization act  which provides  among other things  for billion in payments to compensate u 
s 
air carriers for losses incurred as a result of the terrorist attacks that occurred on september   billion in federal credit instruments loan guarantees to us air carriers to guarantee loans from lenders to those air carriers  subject to certain conditions and fees  the authority of the secretary of transportation to reimburse air carriers which authority expires days after enactment of the stabilization act for the increase in the cost of insurance  deferral of the payment by us air carriers of certain taxes  and a million liability limit for us air carriers  at the discretion of the secretary of transportation  for acts of terrorism committed during a day period following enactment of the stabilization act 
the impact of the terrorist attacks of september  and their aftermath on the company and the sufficiency of its financial resources to absorb this impact will depend on a number of factors  including the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks on the economy in general  the level of air travel demand  mix of cargo and passenger travel and related revenues  the company s ability to reduce its operating costs and conserve its financial resources  taking into account the increased costs that it will incur as a consequence of the attacks  the higher costs associated with new faa security directives and any other increased regulation of air carriers  the significantly higher costs of aviation insurance coverage  and the extent to which such insurance will continue to be commercially available to the company and its vendors  the ability of the company to reduce its costs and the timing of those cost reductions  the ability of the company to raise financing in light of the various factors referred to herein  the company s ability to renegotiate its aircraft lease rates  and the extent of the benefits received by the company under the stabilization act or regulations issued pursuant thereto 
presently  the company is unable to estimate the entire impact on it of the events of september   and the sufficiency of its financial resources to absorb that impact  including the mitigating effects of the stabilization act and other actions taken by the company 
however  given the magnitude of these unprecedented events and the possible subsequent effects  the adverse impact to the company s financial condition  results of operations and its prospects will be material 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues 
operating revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in operating revenue was primarily attributable to more block hours for usaf and commercial passenger acmi flying offset by less cargo acmi and commercial full service flying 
the usaf revenue increased in due to the larger fixed contract base as well as additional expansion flying related to increased military activity 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased to million in from million in total operating expenses for were reduced by a million grant received under the stabilization act from the federal government 
total operating expenses for were reduced by a million contract dispute settlement received from malaysia airlines 
flight expenses include all expenses related directly to the operation of the aircraft other than maintenance  aircraft rent  insurance and fuel 
also included are expenses related to flight dispatch and flight operations administration 
flight expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase of million in pilot and flight attendant costs caused by increased staffing levels necessitated by the increase in full service usaf flying and additional cargo aircraft 
pilot payroll costs also increased due to contractual wage increases 
maintenance expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in the increase in was primarily due to the following 
million for completed engine overhauls  which are the amounts in excess of paid reserves that are available for reimbursement from the lessors  
million of thrust reverser and landing gear overhauls and million for additional work required on apu overhauls  
credits in fiscal of million for the reversal of maintenance accruals  million for the recording of accounts receivable related to insurance settlements on aircraft repairs  million for the cumulative interest on security deposits for two md aircraft and million for engine parts that were recovered in the fourth quarter of  
million of required lease reserve maintenance payments due primarily to the net three additional dc aircraft added to the fleet as well as more block hours flown  
million in aircraft component repairs  of which approximately million are not anticipated to be incurred in future periodsthese are costs related to the initiation of the power by the hour maintenance agreement for md aircraft components and the wheel brake cost per landing agreement  
million related to the write off of a prepaid maintenance item  and 
scheduled maintenance checks  insurance deductibles and higher wage as well as personnel expenses for mechanics 
aircraft costs increased million  or  to million in from million in this was primarily due to the increase in the number of average aircraft to in from in  offset by reductions in the lease rates for the fleet of md aircraft 
see liquidity and capital resources for information on deferrals of aircraft rent payments that affect the financial position of the company at december  and the company s financial commitments for and beyond 
fuel expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase reflects the increase in block hours flown together with an increase in average fuel prices per gallon to in from in the company is generally able to pass fuel cost increases through to its customers 
commissions increased by million in principally as a result of the increase in amc business in and an increase in the commission rate on this amc business 
subcontract flying costs decreased million to million in from million in the higher costs in resulted from outsourcing flights during due to aircraft being out of service for maintenance 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily the result of costs associated with the relocation of the company s headquarters from virginia to georgia as well as additional expense related to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  outside legal fees  equipment rentals  outside services  and employment recruiting and advertising 
the company expects to have lower sales  general and administrative expenses in due to the absence of relocation costs 
other expense net 
total other expense  net increased by million in compared with this increase was primarily due to million of prepayment penalties incurred due to the early repayment of debt in connection with a sale leaseback of two owned engines in june year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the third quarter ended september   the company changed its method of accounting for certain aircraft maintenance costs from the accrual method of accounting to the direct expense method 
under the new accounting method  maintenance costs are recognized as expense as maintenance services are performed and as flight hours are flown for nonrefundable maintenance payments required by lease agreements 
the company believes that the new accounting principle is preferable because the direct expense method is the predominant method used in the airline industry and there has not been an obligating event prior to the maintenance checks actually being performed or flight hours being flown 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change was million 
operating revenues 
although operating revenues were the same each year at million  revenue per block hour flown increased to  in from  in also  in the company received approximately million in revenue associated with minimum guarantee payments from mas 
no similar payments were received in operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased to million in from million in total operating expenses for were reduced by a million contract dispute settlement received from mas 
flight expenses include all expenses related directly to the operation of the aircraft other than maintenance  aircraft rent  and fuel 
also included are expenses related to flight dispatch and flight operations administration 
flight expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from increases in flight attendant costs and passenger food costs due to more full service flying 
maintenance expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease resulted from a number of reasons including the change in accounting  the reduction in block hours flown and a decrease in the average number of aircraft from to if the new method of accounting that was adopted effective january  had been implemented for  maintenance expenses for would have been million lower 
the company also recorded a credit of million for engine parts that were recovered in the fourth quarter of these parts are included in equipment and property at december  aircraft costs decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease principally reflects reductions in the lease rates for the fleet of md aircraft and the return of two dc aircraft in the second quarter of fuel expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase reflects the increase in full service block hours flown together with an increase in average fuel prices per gallon to in from in the company is generally able to pass fuel cost increases through to its customers 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease resulting from the sale leaseback of an engine in the first quarter of and the ending of amortization of an intangible asset in sales  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease principally reflects the effect of cost control measures the company has implemented in personnel costs in recent years 
other expense net 
interest expense decreased million in to million from in this decrease resulted from reductions in the average amount of debt outstanding 
other non operating income in includes gains of approximately million on the sale of the company s interest in an unaffiliated communications company 
there were no comparable gains in liquidity and capital resources world airways is highly leveraged 
at december   world airways current assets were million and current liabilities were million 
as of december   the company had outstanding long term debt and capital leases of million  and notes payable and current maturities of long term obligations of million 
in addition  the company has significant long term obligations relating to operating leases for aircraft and spare engines 
the company believes that aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments provided in a single location is beneficial to understanding and evaluating the company s liquidity 
the following table presents this aggregated information as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total notes payable   long term debt and capital lease obligations    operating leases        total contractual cash obligations        the company has no unconditional purchase obligations or other commercial commitments such as letters of credit or guarantees 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company began paying amounts less than its contractual aircraft rent obligations in order to conserve cash 
the company continued to recognize expense for the full amount of its contractual rent payments due 
the accrual for unpaid contractual rent obligations is million and is included as accrued rent in the current liabilities section of the balance sheet at december  the company s aircraft lessors have agreed to amended terms of the aircraft lease agreements to provide for the repayment of the unpaid contractual rent obligations 
these amended lease terms provide for repayment of contractual rent obligations under various methods including scheduled monthly payments bearing interest at to percent  payments based on a percentage of profits in future years  or with specified maintenance deposits as defined previously paid by the company and held by lessors 
in addition  the company agreed to extend certain lease terms  which will result in additional future minimum operating lease obligations of approximately million  which is not included in the company s future minimum lease obligations at december  the company has an agreement with gmac commercial credit  llc gmac expiring in april  whereby subject to certain conditions and limitations  gmac will make loans and advances against spare parts and receivables and issue or facilitate the issuance of letters of credit the agreement 
at december   the agreement had a maximum capacity of up to million  subject to borrowing base amounts related to receivables and spare parts  as defined  which collateralize borrowings 
the agreement provides for an unused facility fee of 
of and interest on outstanding borrowings at prime plus 
prime was at december  further  the receivables facility allows for the issuing of letters of credit to a sub limit of million for an issuance and availability fee and interest of 
of 
at december   the loans under the agreement were million  which included million against eligible spare parts inventory and million against eligible receivables 
at december   outstanding letters of credit were million 
at december   the company had submitted all of its available eligible receivables under the agreement 
the agreement contains dividend and borrowing restrictions as well as covenants related to the company s financial condition and operating results 
in march  gmac agreed to an amendment which waived violation of the debt coverage ratio covenant for the quarter ended december  and restated the tangible net worth covenant as of march  this amendment requires that the company reduce the spare parts loan from million to million by july  the stabilization act includes an air carrier loan guarantee program 
this program is designed to assist viable airlines that suffered financially as a result of september th who do not otherwise have access to reasonable credit 
the loan guarantee is subject to certain conditions and fees  including the potential requirement that the us government be issued warrants or other equity instruments in connection with such loan guarantees 
the program s application deadline is june  the company is currently evaluating whether to apply 
if the company does apply and its application is approved  the company will undertake such a financing only if needed 
there can be no assurance that this source of financing will be available to the company 
the company has historically financed working capital and capital expenditure requirements out of cash flow from operating activities  sales of common stock  secured borrowings  and other financings 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences including i world airways ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes may be limited  ii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness  iii world airways degree of leverage and related debt service obligations  as well as its obligations under operating leases  may make it more vulnerable than some of its competitors in a prolonged economic downturn  and iv world airways financial position may restrict its ability to pursue new business opportunities and limit its flexibility in responding to changing business conditions 
although there can be no assurances  world airways believes that the combination of its existing contracts and additional business which it expects to obtain  along with its existing cash  and financing arrangements  will be sufficient to allow the company to meet its cash requirements related to operating and capital requirements for cash flows from operating activities operating activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to using million in the cash used in principally reflects the million loss  net non cash income statement charges of million  a million increase in trade accounts receivable  and a net increase in cash of million due to other changes in operating assets and liabilities 
from february through august  the company had an month salary exchange program for most of its employees 
under the program  participating employees exchanged up to of wages for common stock on the basis of one share of stock for each of wages exchanged and certain executives exchanged additional amounts on the same basis 
the program produced total cash savings of approximately million during the month program and resulted in the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used million in cash for the year ended december   compared to using million in in  cash was generated by the sale and maturity of marketable investments  net of purchases of rotable spare parts  computer equipment  leasehold improvements and other fixed assets 
in  cash was used primarily for the purchase of spare parts 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities generated million in cash for the year ended december  compared to generating million in in  the company received million of proceeds from sale leaseback transactions on four engines and had deferred aircraft rent obligations of million 
the repayment of debt on engines subject to the sale leaseback transactions  along with scheduled debt payments  resulted in repayment of million of debt 
in  the principal transactions were million of cash generated by a sale leaseback transaction offset by million of debt repayments 
capital commitments financing developments the faa has issued and proposed a number of airworthiness directives ad s that will require the company to make modifications to its aircraft 
they are as follows 
the replacement of insulation blankets on the company s md aircraft by june that is expected to cost approximately million per aircraft approximately of this work has been completed  
the installation of enhanced ground proximity warning systems in its aircraft by march that is expected to cost approximately  per aircraft  
the modification of thrust reversers on the company s dc aircraft by february that is estimated to cost approximately million per aircraft  and 
various modifications required by special federal aviation regulation sfar regarding general aircraft and cockpit security in response to the events of september th and the company will apply for reimbursement from the federal government for any costs incurred in accomplishing the required and recommended items relating to increased aircraft security 
the company expects to finance the cost of the ad s through internally generated funds 
world airways capital expenditures for other than the cost of ad s are currently expected to be approximately million  principally for the purchase of aircraft related assets  which it expects to finance from working capital 
in certain circumstances  including the company s common stock being delisted from trading and a change in control of the company  as defined  the holders of the company s million of convertible senior debentures due in could require the company to repurchase the outstanding debentures 
the company obtained an outside legal opinion that delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market would not trigger a default if the company was able to have its stock listed on the over the counter otc bulletin board 
management believes that  in the event of being delisted from trading on the nasdaq smallcap market  the company would be successful in having its stock listed on an otc bulletin board 
in  in conjunction with leasing two md er aircraft the company agreed to assume leases of one or two md f freighter aircraft for the remainder of their year leases that commenced in november and december  in the event that the existing lessee terminates its lease with the lessor 
as of the date hereof  the company does not know if the existing lessee intends to terminate the existing lease or not 
as part of the agreement for the aircraft  the lessor provided spare parts financing of which approximately million is still available

 business combinations  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
and subsequently  sfas no 
after its adoption 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july   and sfas no 
is effective january  the company does not expect either of these standards to have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the company also records a corresponding asset  which is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation

in august   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company is required to adopt sfas no

the company maintains minimal balances in foreign bank accounts to facilitate the payment of expenses 
the company is not exposed to commodity price risks except with respect to the purchase of aviation fuel 
however  fluctuations in the price of fuel have not had a significant impact on the company s operations in recent years because  in general  the company s contracts with its customers limit the company s exposure to increases in fuel prices 
the company purchases no fuel under long term contracts nor does the company enter into futures or swap contracts at this time
