item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the changes in financial position and results of operations over the past several years 
investors should refer to the consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and statistical information presented elsewhere in this report when reading this section of the report 
the cautionary statements described below are for the purpose of qualifying for the safe harbor provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of risk factors our business involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  with the loss of all or part of an investment in our common stock 
described below  are the material risks of investing in university bancorp s common stock 
investors should carefullyconsider these prior to purchasing any shares 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq small cap market the marketability of our shares could decrease nasdaq has informed management that the company s common stock would be de listed from the nasdaq small cap market if the market value of shares held by non insiders of the company remains below  through may  as of march    shares of university bancorp common stock were owned by non insiders of the company 
a floor bid price of per share is needed to meet the public float requirement of  as of march   the current bid price was per share of common stock 
also  nasdaq has informed management that the company s common stock would be delisted from the nasdaq small cap market if the bid price of the company s common stock does not trade at at least per share for ten consecutive trading days prior to september  if the company s common stock is de listed from nasdaq  the shares will be less marketable in the future and there will be a smaller potential pool of investors for the stock 
this would significantly limit the ability of shareholders deciding to sell their shares to do so 
if the company is de listed  the management of university bancorp could opt to list its common stock on the nasdaq bulletin board 
you may not be able to sell your shares upon demand although the company s common stock is currently listed for trading on the nasdaq small cap market  the trading market for university bancorp historically has been less active than the average trading market for companies listed on the exchange 
in addition  the share price of university bancorp has been volatile and has ranged from to in the past months 
factors such as the limited number of shares outstanding held by the public  the lack of earnings history and the absence of a reasonable expectation of dividends within the near future mean that there might not be an active and liquid market for the company s common stock 
even if an active market develops  there can be no assurance that a market will continue 
purchasers of the company s common stock should carefully consider the potentially illiquid and long term nature of their investment in the shares 
the company s stock is controlled by insiders of the company  which may not provide you with the best possible return on your investment a majority of the shares outstanding are held by insiders of the company 
the ranzini group mr 
joseph l 
ranzini  mr 
stephen lange ranzini  mrs 
mildred ranzini  the various ranzini family trusts beneficially owns  or of the issued and outstanding shares at march  these individuals are able to exert a significant measure of control over university bancorp s affairs and policies 
this control could be used  for example  to help prevent an acquisition of university bancorp  precluding shareholders from possibly realizing any possible premium which may be offered for the common stock by a potential acquirer 
your ownership of the company may be further diluted if the bank requires additional capital there can be no assurance that the bank will not need additional capital in the near future to support the bank s growth or to counter operating losses 
funds necessary to meet the bank s working capital needs and to finance its expansion might not be available 
if additional equity securities are needed to finance future expansion  such sale could result in significant dilution to the existing shareholders 
university bank has incurred significant start up losses and may never achieve profitability university bank s operations were relocated to ann arbor in university bank has a history of losses and has incurred substantial operating losses 
shareholders are subject to the risks inherent in starting a new business 
the bank s profitability will depend primarily upon operations that might never become profitable 
management of the bank believes that as the size of loan portfolio and retail deposits increase that the bank should become profitable  but there is no assurance that expenses will not rise at a faster rate than expected as the bank grows 
there is no assurance that university bank will grow to a size that will enable it to become profitable 
university bancorp had a consolidated net loss of  during and an accumulated deficit of  at december  the small size of university bank limits its ability to compete with larger financial institutions university bank faces strong competition for deposits  loans and other financial services from numerous michigan and out of state banks  thrifts  credit unions and other financial institutions 
some of the financial institutions with which university bank competes with are not subject to the same degree of regulation as university bank is 
many of these financial institutions aggressively compete for business in the ann arbor area 
most of the bank s competitors have been in business for many years  have established customer bases  have numerous branches  have substantially higher lending limits  and offer certain services that we do not provide 
the dominant competitors in the ann arbor area are great lakes bank  national city bank  comerica bank  bank one  key bank and republic bank 
there can be no assurance that university bank will be able to compete effectively with these competitors unless it can continue to grow its operations 
the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and summary of results of operations the company s net loss from continuing operations was  in   in and  in earnings loss per share from continuing operations for  and were  and  respectively 
including both continuing operations and discontinued operations  our net loss was  in   in and  in the operations of the company showed significant progress in as compared to the net loss was reduced by  to  in from  in the company benefited from the declining interest rates in and increased its net interest margin by  over the previous year 
other income rose by  the operations of midwest loan services contributed significantly to this category as their loan servicing and mortgage origination activity exceeded the prior year 
the increase in income was offset partially by an increase in the company s other expenses 
other expense increased by  from increased salary and benefits at midwest accounted of the majority of the rise in other expense 
midwest hired additional personnel in to manage the higher levels of loan servicing and origination 
barring four sizeable non recurring items  both university bancorp and the bank would have made a profit for the entire year 
those non recurring items were midwest servicing rights valuation  bank foreclosed real estate valuation  bank non cash stock compensation  bank bidco loss  bancorp the following non recurring items negatively impacted the bank s result midwest servicing rights valuation 
the bank s midwest loan services subsidiary took a writedown on its servicing rights of  because long term rates temporarily dipped to year lows immediately following the terrorist attacks in september once written down the servicing rights cannot be written up under generally accepted accounting principles even though long term rates did subsequently rise 
the write down reduced midwest s basis in servicing rights to  from  the risk in the remaining rights is effectively offset by a principal only mortgage backed security investment that increased income during by  foreclosed real estate valuation 
in early  management engaged an experienced real estate company to develop an other real estate owned site carried on the bank s books 
during  the bank wrote down its investment in this property to  incurring a  loss 
substantially all approvals for the proposed development have been received and the bank anticipates closing on the sale of the property by mid summer at the contracted price of  this site is the only foreclosed real estate currently owned by the bank 
stock compensation expense 
the bank expensed  in non cash compensation expense related to an incentive we provided as a hiring bonus to a new executive officer in the total of these non recurring items is  without these items  the bank s income would have been  in bidco loss 
in addition  the bank holding company took a write down on its investment in michigan bidco of  to  as a result of several factors including the writedown of one investment  and research and development expense related to two e payment patents that were applied for during the year 
the bank s investment in the bidco is now  in cumulative preferred stock 
the bank realized no income from its equity investment in the bidco in although a capital restructuring of the bidco reduced the bank s investment in the bidco by 
management estimates that the bidco preferred stock dividends and ultimate redemption of the preferred stock should increase the bank s income in and subsequent years by  including both continuing operations and discontinued operations  the loss in was similar in amount to the loss in  however  the losses flowed from primarily different causes 
results in were negatively impacted by a decrease in the contribution to profit by michigan bidco in from  to  goodwill amortization of  related to an earn out payment related to the acquisition of midwest loan services  legal expense related to the successful defense of a lawsuit related to the sale of varsity mortgage of approximately  and unusually high external auditor expenses of over  these negative developments in overwhelmed the underlying profit improvement at the community banking operation and the increased profits at midwest loan services 
as a result of the trend toward improved underlying operating results  university bank had a profit in four of the last six months of results in were negatively impacted by losses at discontinued operations of  losses caused by an adverse judgment in a lawsuit totaling  losses at the community banking operation  and only break even results at midwest loan services  which were only partially offset by a record contribution from michigan bidco of  the following table summarizes the pre tax income loss of each profit center of the company for the years ended december  and in thousands twelve months ended december  and pre tax income loss summary community banking  midwest loan services merchant banking michigan bidco corporate office total net interest income net interest income represents the dollar amount by which interest income generated by interest earning assets exceeds the cost of funds 
interest earning assets consist primarily of loans  short term investments and investment securities  and the principal cost of funds is the interest paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings 
net interest income is affected by i the difference between the average rate of interest earned on the bank s interest earning assets and the average rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread and ii the relative amounts of its average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in order to maintain and increase earnings during periods of fluctuating interest rates  it is imperative that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities be managed effectively 
trends in net interest income provide a measure of the effectiveness by which a financial institution manages its interest rate sensitivity

net interest income increased 
million to million in from million in the increase resulted from an increase in the net interest rate spread  plus an increase in earning assets 
net interest income increased primarily due to a lower rate environment in as compared to in  the federal reserve bank lowered the short term interest rate numerous times in an attempt to stimulate the united states economy 
the company s positioning of rate sensitive assets and liabilities was structured to benefit from a drop in interest rates 
the average yield on interest rate liabilities declined from in to in in contrast  the average yield on interest bearing assets increased slightly from to in the spread between the average yield on rate sensitive assets and liabilities rose to in from in additionally  the net interest income was positively affected in by higher volume of earning assets 
total interest bearing assets increased by million to million in from million in including only activity from continuing operations  net interest income increased to million in from million in  mainly as a result of an increase in the yield on net interest earning assets faster than an increase in the rate on interest bearing liabilities 
during the year ended december   the average interest earning asset base fell by million or from  while average interest bearing liabilities decreased by million or 
due to the rise in short term interest rates  the average cost of interest bearing deposits increased from in to in as a result of an increase in yield on interest earning assets in an amount greater than the increase in the rate on interest bearing liabilities which more than offset the decrease of interest bearing assets at a rate greater than the decrease in interest bearing liabilities  the net interest margin increased to in from in short term interest rates bottomed in mid year  and by year end  short term interest rates were higher 
long term interest rates hit an interim peak in  but trended lower throughout the following table presents information regarding fluctuations in our interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated

provision for loan losses the bank charges to operations a provision for possible loan losses which is intended to create an allowance for future loan losses inherent in the bank s portfolio 
each year s provision reflects management s analysis of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for possible loan losses at a level adequate to absorb anticipated losses 
in its evaluation  management considers factors like historical loan loss experience  specifically identified problem loans  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
a loan is charged off by management as a loss when deemed uncollectible  although collection efforts continue and future recoveries may occur 
non performing loans are defined as loans which have been placed on non accrual status and loans over days past due as to principal or interest and still in an accrual status 
where serious doubt exists as to the collectibility of a loan  the accrual of interest is discontinued 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impaired and past due loans 
non performing loans amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively 
the bulk of the non performing loans at year end are delinquent real estate loans

the bank s overall loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in ann arbor and the future performance of these loans is dependent upon the performance of relatively limited geographical areas 
since the bank has a limited experience with its loan portfolio in ann arbor  the bank s historical loss ratios may be less than future loss ratios 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  although the ultimate adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon future economic factors beyond our control 
a downturn in the general nationwide economy will tend to aggravate  for example  the problems of local loan customers currently facing some difficulties 
a general nationwide business expansion could result in fewer loan customers being unable to repay their loans 
other real estate owned at december  and december  includes a commercial development site in sault ste 
marie  michigan 
based upon an appraisal  management believes the acre site where a former loan office is located has a fair market value more than its carrying value of  at december  the bank no longer intends to utilize it for a branch location and accordingly has classified it as other real estate owned 
management has executed an agreement to sell the property to a third party for  subject to various contingencies 
there is no assurance that a sale of the sault ste marie property will be consummated 
non interest income and non interest expense non interest income 
for continuing operations  non interest income increased to  in  from  in  an increase of 
the increase in was mainly the result of increased revenues from midwest loan services loan subservicing and set up fees  which more than offset a decline in income from merchant banking bidco income  because the bidco s results were deconsolidated after may  for continuing operations  non interest income increased to  in  from  in  an increase of 
the increase in was mainly the result of increased revenues from midwest loan services loan subservicing and set up fees  which more than offset a decline in income from merchant banking bidco income  because the bidco s results were deconsolidated after may  mortgage banking 
mortgage banking  servicing and origination fees increased from  in to  in the increase in mortgage banking fee income was the result of an increase in the number of loans subserviced at midwest loan services 
likewise  mortgage banking  servicing and origination fees increased to  in from  in the increases in mortgage banking fee income for both and was the result of an increase in the number of loans subserviced at midwest loan services 
during  midwest loan services increased its mortgage subservicing contracts by from billion to billion as a result of a new business relationship with one of the top five mortgage banking firms on wall street 
during the first half of  midwest reached a peak of billion in family residential loan servicing 
in the third quarter of the year  the loan servicing volume was significantly cut back as midwest s largest customer decided to significantly scale back the amount of business it was providing to midwest 
as of july    loans or of the mortgages sub serviced by midwest for this customer had been transferred to other sub servicers including a subsidiary of this firm with the rest transferred the following month 
during midwest increased its emphasis on mortgage loan originations through its credit union customers 
much of the increase in loan set up and other fees resulted from fee income from mortgage originations generated from member of credit unions 
in  midwest originated mortgage loans 
growth was consistent in each month throughout the year 
in january mortgage loans were originated and were originated in december  an  increase 
the servicing rights portfolio totaled  of fhlmc and fnma mortgages at december   versus  at december  all residential mortgage loan servicing in and was performed by midwest loan services 
based on recent comparable sales and indications of market value from industry brokers  management believes that the current market value of the bank s portfolio of mortgage servicing rights equals cost 
market interest rate conditions can quickly affect the value of mortgage servicing rights in a positive or negative fashion  as long term interest rates rise and fall

mortgage banking michigan bidco 
bidco invests in businesses in michigan with the objective of capital gains while fostering job growth and economic development 
as of december   the bidco had made twenty nine investments since its inception in  amounting to a total of  at original cost  before repayments or participations sold 
at december   michigan bidco had total assets of  versus  at december  the financial results of michigan bidco were accounted for under the equity method of accounting until march in april   of michigan bidco bonds were repurchased by the bidco  and university bank converted its  of bonds into common stock  thereby increasing the bank s equity ownership to 
effective april  michigan bidco s financial results became consolidated into the results of university bancorp 
the remaining michigan bidco bonds were converted into common stock on may   and thus diluted university bancorp s equity ownership down to

non interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase was primarily the result of increased operational expenses at midwest loan services  which more than offset cost control efforts in other areas at the bank 
during the year the retail bank division s non interest expenses increased by just  to  from  midwest s operations were expanded in due to a substantial increase in mortgage sub servicing and origination activity 
as the volume expanded midwest increased its workforce to perform the required tasks 
other servicing and sub servicing related expenses  such as occupancy  supplies and postage increased also 
at the bank level  a concerted effort was made to reduce its non interest expenses 
notable improvements were made in the legal and audit expense category 
non interest expense was also impacted by an increase in the amortization of the mortgage servicing rights due to the low interest rate environment after september including only activity from continuing operations  our non interest expense increased to  in from  in  a increase 
during the year non interest expenses at the retail bank division increased by  from  to  primarily as a result of higher legal and audit expenses 
increases in most other areas were the result of growth at midwest loan services 
data processing expenses were higher primarily because of a variety of internet initiatives  including internet banking and development projects at midwest loan services 
university bancorp s total non interest expense decreased  despite  in goodwill amortization expense related to an earn out payment from the midwest loan services acquisition 
the increase in goodwill amortization was more than offset by decreases in esop and legal costs 
liquidity and capital resources our total assets at december  amounted to million compared to million at december  loans receivable  net of reserves and including loans held for sale  increased by million to million from million 
cash and cash equivalents including federal funds sold on an overnight basis at the end of decreased by million from the prior year  while securities increased by million 
at year end  the bank had an unused line of credit from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis of million  and an unused line of credit from the federal reserve bank of chicago of million 
university bank  as an fdic insured bank  is subject to certain regulations that require the maintenance of minimum liquidity levels of cash and eligible investments 
the bank has historically exceeded this minimum as a result of its investments in federal funds sold  us government and us agency securities and cash 
in addition  university bancorp had  in cash and equity securities at the end of to meet cash needs  primarily operating expenses and interest and principal reductions on the university bancorp s note payable 
the balance of the loan was  and  at year end and the note is a fully amortizing loan maturing in early in an effort to maintain the bank s tier capital to assets ratio above and to increase capital through retained earnings  management does not expect that the bank will pay dividends to university bancorp in management intends that the cash and securities on hand  together with cash from the sale of common stock  equity conversion notes and preferred stock to be sufficient to cover the required principal reductions during on university bancorp s loan 
during  university bancorp raised working capital by issuing equity conversion notes  which bear interest at prime rate although all payment of interest is deferred until conversion into common stock or redemption 
notes are redeemable only through the proceeds of a future sale of common stock or preferred stock 
the various equity conversion notes that were issued were converted into common stock in november as part of our rights offering of common stock  which raised  through the sale of  shares  less offering expenses 
the equity conversion notes were sold to our president  chairman and members of their family

market risk impact of inflation the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
since our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general effects of inflation 
however  to the extent that inflation affects interest rates  it also affects our net income 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial institutions are significantly affected by fluctuations in interest rates commonly referred to as interest rate risk 
the principal exposure of a financial institution s earnings to interest rate risk is the difference in time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest earning assets compared to the time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest bearing liabilities 
this difference is commonly referred to as a financial institution s gap position 
in periods when interest rates are increasing  a negative gap position will result in generally lower earnings as long term assets are repricing upward slower than short term liabilities 
however during a declining rate environment  the opposite effect on earnings is true  with earnings rising due to long term assets repricing downward slower than short term liabilities 
rising long term and short term interest rates tend to increase the value of midwest loan services investment in mortgage servicing rights and improve midwest loan services current return on these rights by lowering required amortization rates on the rights 
rising interest rates tend to decrease new mortgage origination activity  negatively impacting current income from the bank s retail mortgage banking operations and midwest s mortgage banking operation activities 
rising interest rates also slow midwest loan services rate of growth  but increases the duration of its existing mortgages being subserviced under contract 
the bank s securities portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the market value risk associated with the servicing rights 
during  the market value of the servicing rights versus book decreased by approximately  the decrease was expensed as amortization expense to while the market value of the bank s zero coupon and po securities increased by  based on year end fair market values

see footnote to the financial statements legal proceedings at december  we had no outstanding legal proceedings that would have a material affect on us 
results in the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted by legal expense to defend and settle a lawsuit related to the bank s sale  in november  of its shares in varsity mortgage  llc to paramount bank of farmington hills  michigan 
subsequent to the sale  varsity experienced management problems and a further drop in its business resulting in substantial operating losses
