the company assumes no obligation for updating any such forward looking statements to reflect actual results  changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statements due to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the dependence of the company s revenue on a number of sizable orders from a small number of customers  the timing of orders and shipments which can cause the company to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly and annual revenue and operating results  timely receipt of required supplies and components which could result in delays in anticipated shipments  general product demand and market acceptance risks  the ability of the company to successfully compete with alternative and similar technologies  the timing and continuation of the automotive industry s retooling programs  the ability of the company to resolve technical issues inherent in the development of new products and technologies  the ability of the company to identify and satisfy market needs  general product development and commercialization difficulties  the ability of the company to attract and retain key personnel  especially technical personnel  the quality and cost of competitive products already in existence or developed in the future  the level of interest existing and potential new customers may have in new products and technologies generally  rapid or unexpected technological changes  the effect of economic conditions  particularly economic conditions in the domestic and worldwide automotive industry  which has from time to time been subject to cyclical downturns due to the level of demand for  or supply of  the products produced by companies in this industry  the continued availability of the company s current line of credit and the lender s continued willingness to waive violations of financial covenants under the line of credit in the event that the company s future results do not satisfy such covenants  the level of the damage award in a pending arbitration matter with a former distributor of the company  variations in the amount of cost savings anticipated from the cost reduction initiatives and the impact of cost reduction initiatives on the company s revenues  order bookings and earnings 
the company s expectations regarding future bookings are based upon oral discussions with customers and are subject to change based upon a wide variety of factors  including economic conditions and system implementation delays 
certain of these new orders have been delayed in the past and could be delayed in the future 
because the company s products are typically integrated into larger systems or lines  the timing of new orders is dependent on the timing of completion of the overall system or line 
in addition  because the company s products have shorter lead times than other components and are required later in the process  orders for the company s products tend to be given later in the integration process
