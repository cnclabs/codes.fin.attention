results of operations earnings and dividend summary and outlook our high quality residential mortgage loan business continues to drive our growth and profitability 
our credit results remain excellent and we continue to increase our market share  gain new customers  and strengthen our competitive position 
in  we also increased our equity base through three common stock offerings  improved our operating efficiencies  and further strengthened our balance sheet 
these factors  along with falling short term interest rates  all contributed to our record earnings performance 
core earnings were per share for the fourth quarter of  an increase of over fourth quarter core earnings of per share 
core earnings were per share in the third quarter core earnings for the year were per share  an increase of over core earnings for the year of per share and an increase of over core earnings per share of for core earnings equal gaap earnings excluding mark to market adjustments and non recurring items 
gaap earnings for the fourth quarter of were per share and for the full year of were per share  in each case representing a substantial increase over prior year results 
see table for a reconciliation of gaap earnings and core earnings 
during  a year of falling short term interest rates  our asset yield dropped by from to while our cost of borrowed funds dropped by from to 
the spread we earned between our asset yield and our cost of funds increased from in to in our spread increased as we replaced lower yielding aaa rated mortgage securities with higher yielding mortgage loans and credit enhancement securities 
we believe this change in portfolio mix a change that we expect will continue in will provide long term benefits 
in  we also benefited on a more temporary basis  due to falling interest rates from a slight mismatch we carry between the earning rate adjustment frequencies of our assets generally  each six months and the borrowing rate adjustment frequencies of our liabilities generally  every month 
ours is a scalable business  so we get more efficient as we grow 
operating expenses increased by in while the scale of our business as measured by our equity capital base grew by 
this increase in operating efficiency was a major contributor to our increase in earnings per share in and should continue to benefit us going forward 
future growth in our business should lead to additional efficiency gains 
our core net income for was million  an increase of from the million we earned in our core return on equity was in and in we increased our regular quarterly cash dividend rate several times in regular dividends for our common shareholders were for the first quarter  per share for the second quarter  per share for the third quarter  and per share for the fourth quarter of we also paid a special common stock cash dividend of per common share in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of total regular common stock dividends for were per share 
total common stock dividend distributions  including special dividends  were per share for on march   our board of directors declared an increase in our regular quarterly cash dividend rate for the first quarter of to per common share 
we believe we will have a strong year in  we expect to continue to benefit from healthy origination volume by our customers  asset growth at redwood  improvements in asset mix  improved operational efficiencies  and favorable credit results 
however  earnings per share in may not reach the exceptional levels we achieved in  when our earnings received a temporary boost due to rapidly falling short term interest rates 
many market participants expect short term interest rates to rise during relative to our earnings potential during a period of stable interest rates  we believe rising interest rates may or may not have a negative effect on our earnings trends 
a rapid or unexpected increase would be a negative factor for several quarters 
over longer periods of time  higher interest rates are generally favorable for our business 
our first goal in managing redwood trust s operations is to do our best to make sure that our regular dividend rate for common shareholders remains sustainable in the long run from the cash flows generated by our assets 
we believe the new regular dividend rate of per common share per quarter that we established in the first quarter of is a sustainable rate  even in most circumstances if some business trends become less favorable or interest rates increase 
in the event we earn taxable reit income in excess of the dividends we distribute at our regular dividend rate  we may declare one or more special dividends during we believe the longer term trends that really matter are the strength of our credit results and the strength of our competitive market position 
if these stay strong  we may be able to increase our cash flows and increase our regular dividend rate over time 
reconciliation of gaap income and core income the table below reconciles core earnings to reported gaap earnings

it is calculated as gaap earnings from ongoing operations less mark to market adjustments on certain assets  hedges  and variable stock options and non recurring items 
management believes that core earnings provide relevant and useful information regarding our results of operations in addition to gaap measures of performance 
this is  in part  because market valuation adjustments on only a portion of our assets and stock options and none of our liabilities are recognized through our income statement under gaap  and these valuation adjustments may not be fully indicative of changes in market values on our balance sheet or a reliable guide to our current or future operating performance 
furthermore  gains or losses realized upon sales of assets and operating results of closed business units are generally non recurring and any non recurring items may also be unrepresentative of our current or future operating performance 
because all companies and analysts do not calculate non gaap measures such as core earnings in the same fashion  core earnings as calculated by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
net interest income net interest income after credit expenses rose to million in the fourth quarter of from million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of net interest income increased to million for the year from million in and from million in we benefited from our continuing strategy of growth in our high quality jumbo residential mortgage loan business  a business where we believe we have a solid competitive position and favorable long term market trends 
we benefited from a change in asset mix as we added higher yielding assets 
we also benefited from rapidly falling short term interest rates  as our cost of borrowed funds on floating rate liabilities declined faster than the asset yields on our adjustable rate mortgage assets

despite the sale of the collateral assets to a special purpose bankruptcy remote financing trust and the non recourse nature of the securities issued from that trust  redwood to date has accounted for its securitizations as financings rather than as sales 
thus  the securitized assets remain on our reported balance sheet residential mortgage loans and the securities issued remain on our balance sheet as liabilities long term debt 
this accounting method avoids gain on sale treatment of our transactions  and we believe it provides greater transparency to investors regarding our activities 
if we had accounted for our securitizations as sales  our reported balance sheet both assets and liabilities would be substantially smaller 
as a result  many of the ratios one might use to analyze our business would be different 
for instance  our interest rate spread would be wider and our debt to equity ratio lower 
ratios calculated on this basis may be more comparable to those reported by some other financial institutions 
the table below presents our interest income and interest expense on an at risk basis for assets and a recourse basis for liability generally  conforming to the income statement items we would report if we accounted for our securitizations as sales rather than financings

the fourth quarter decrease in our interest income and asset yields did not result in a material reduction of our operating margins  however  as this decline in asset yield was fully offset by a rapid decrease in our cost of borrowed funds 
the yield on our earning assets  the bulk of which are adjustable rate residential mortgage loans  fell from in the fourth quarter of to in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of in addition to falling short term interest rates  a factor in this decline in asset yield was an increase in premium amortization expenses caused  in part  by an increase in long term mortgage prepayment rate assumptions for certain premium assets accounted for under the effective yield method

in calculating shareholder wealth  we assume that dividends are reinvested through the purchase of additional shares at the prevailing book value per share

this is a measure of management value added  not a measure of actual shareholder returns

we increased book value to per share at december  through the retention of cash by keeping dividends lower than cash flow  changes in market values of assets  issuance of stock at prices above book value  and repurchases of stock below book value 
since we mark to market many of our assets through our balance sheet  reported book value is a good approximation of tangible value in the company 
cumulative dividends paid during this period were per share  and reinvestment earnings on those dividends were per share 
thus  cumulatively  shareholder wealth has increased from per share to per share during this year period 
a company that earned an after tax return on equity and retained all its earnings would have shown a similar amount of shareholder wealth growth during this period

taxable income and dividends we generally intend to distribute over time as preferred and common stock dividends of our reit taxable income earned at our parent company  redwood trust  which has elected reit status but not the earnings generated in our taxable subsidiaries 
our reit taxable income may differ materially from our core earnings or reported gaap income 
the table below summarizes the differences between our gaap earnings and taxable income in each of the past three years 
the taxable income results presented for represents our current best estimate  actual taxable income we report on our tax return to be filed later this year may end up being different from these estimates for a variety of reasons

generally  distributions depend on our reit taxable income  gaap earnings  cash flows  overall financial condition  maintenance of reit status  and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
the board of directors may reduce our regular dividend rate but not below the minimum dividend distribution requirements when it believes it may be in the long term interest of redwood trust and its shareholders to do so 
no dividends will be paid or set apart for payment on shares of our common stock unless full cumulative dividends have been paid on our class b cumulative convertible preferred stock 
as of december   full cumulative dividends have been paid on the class b preferred stock 
under current policy  the board sets our regular dividend at a rate that it believes is more likely than not to be sustainable  given current expectations for cash flow generation and other factors 
in years when our dividend distribution requirements exceed what we believe to be our sustainable dividend rate  the board may declare one or more special quarterly cash dividends 
distributions to our shareholders will generally be subject to tax as ordinary income  although a portion of such distributions may be designated by us as capital gain or may constitute a tax free return of capital 
all dividends declared and paid in the last three years have been ordinary income 
our board of directors may elect to maintain a steady dividend rate during periods of fluctuating reit taxable income 
in such event  the board may choose to declare dividends that include a return of capital 
we will generally attempt to avoid acquiring assets or structuring financings or sales at the reit corporate level that may generate unrelated business taxable income ubti or excess inclusion income for our shareholders but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
we annually furnish to each shareholder a statement setting forth distributions paid during the preceding year and their characterization as ordinary income  capital gains or return of capital

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policies  and how changes in estimates might affect our financial results and statements  are discussed below 
we estimate the fair value of our assets and hedges using available market information and other appropriate valuation methodologies 
we believe the estimates we use accurately reflect the values we may be able to receive should we choose to sell them 
our estimates are inherently subjective in nature and involve matters of uncertainty and judgment to interpret relevant market and other data 
many factors are necessary to estimate market values  including  but not limited to interest rates  prepayment rates  and amount and timing of credit losses 
in addition to our valuation processes  we are active acquirers  and occasional sellers  of the assets we own and we are active users of hedges 
thus  we have the ability to understand and determine changes in assumptions that are taking place in the market place  and make appropriate changes in our assumptions for valuing assets in our portfolio 
in addition  we use third party sources to assist in developing our estimates 
furthermore  for many of the assets we pledge to obtain collateralized short term borrowings  we obtain market valuations from our counterparties on our assets in order to establish the maximum amount of borrowings 
changes in the perceptions regarding future events can have a material impact on the value of such assets 
should such changes  or other factors  result in significant changes in the market values  our income and or book value could be adversely affected 
we recognize revenue on most of our assets using the effective yield method 
the use of this method requires us to project the cash flow over the remaining life of each asset 
such projections include assumptions about interest rates  prepayment rates  timing and amount of credit losses  when certain tests will be met that may allow for changes in payments made under the structure of securities  and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our assumptions used to generate future cash flows  or the current period s yield for each asset  will prove to be accurate 
our current period earnings may be not accurately reflect the yield to be earned on that asset for the remaining life 
we review our cash flow projections on an ongoing basis 
we monitor the critical performance factors for each loan and security 
our expectations of future asset cash flow performance are shaped by input and analysis received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
one assumption used in projecting cash flows  and thus our current yield  is the level and timing of credit losses that we expect to incur over the lives of our earning assets 
we establish this level of future estimated credit losses as a credit reserve 
the reserve is based upon our assessment of various factors affecting our assets  including current and projected economic conditions  delinquency status  and external credit protection 
our actual credit losses  and the timing of these losses  may differ from those estimates used to establish the reserve 
such differences will result in different yields over the life of the asset than we may be currently reporting under gaap 
if such differences are adverse  and the market value of our assets has declined below our carrying value  we may need to take current period mark to market charges through our income statement 
we continually review and update  if appropriate  all of our assumptions 
despite this continual review  there can be no assurance that our assumptions used to estimate cash flows  fair values  and effective yields will prove to be correct as interest rates  economic conditions  real estate conditions  and the market s perception of the future constantly change 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources cash flow cash flow from operations equals earnings adjusted for non cash items  such as depreciation  amortization  provisions  and mark to market adjustments 
free cash flow equals cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and increases in working capital 
generally  free cash flow together with principal receipts from assets is available to pay dividends  pay down debt  repurchase stock  or acquire new portfolio assets 
funds retained to support a net increase in portfolio investment generally equals free cash flow less dividends plus any net issuance of stock 
the presentation of free cash flow and funds available for portfolio investing is intended to supplement the presentation of cash provided by operating activities in accordance with gaap 
since all companies do not calculate these alternative measures of cash flow in the same fashion  free cash flow and funds retained for portfolio investing may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
over the past several quarters  our cash flow from operations has exceeded our earnings and our dividend distributions 
in the fourth quarter of  cash flow from operations was million  consisting of earnings of million plus non cash depreciation  amortization  compensation  and mark to market adjustments of million 
our free cash flow  which is our cash flow from operations plus changes in working capital  property  plant  equipment  and other non earning assets  was million 
in addition  we issued million in new common stock during the quarter through a common stock offering and our direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan 
we used the available cash from these sources to fund our common stock dividend of million and to increase our investment in our portfolio activities by million 
for the year  cash flow from operations was million  an increase from the million we generated in our cash flow from operations in was the result of earnings of million  plus non cash expenses and adjustments of million 
the non cash expenses are primarily our net premium amortization expense 
working capital decreases net of capital expenditures totaled million during the year  resulting in free cash flow of million generated during this free cash flow was used to pay out million in common dividends 
our three equity offerings in  plus our dividend reinvestment program provided an additional million in capital 
our funds available for incremental investment in our portfolio in totaled million table cash flow all dollars in thousands changes in net working funds cash capital available non flow and free common purchase for gaap cash from other cash dividends sale portfolio earnings items operations assets flow paid of stock investing q        q        q       q        q        q        q        q        our ability to retain significant amounts of the free cash flow that we generate may be diminished in the future should our minimum dividend distribution requirements increase relative to our free cash flow see the discussion on taxable income and dividends above 
short term borrowings and liquidity the substantial majority of our short term borrowings have maturities of one year or earlier and have interest rates that change monthly to a margin over or under the one month libor interest rate 
some of our short term borrowing facilities are committed  for which we pay fees  but most are uncommitted 
our facilities are generally for a term of up to one year  although certain assets maybe funded for periods up to three years 
these facilities have restrictions on pledged asset types and debt covenant tests  we continue to meet these requirements 
at december   we have over a dozen uncommitted facilities for short term collateralized debt  with credit approval for billion of borrowings 
we have had no difficulty securing short term borrowings on favorable terms 
outstanding borrowings under these agreements were million at december   a decrease from million at year end due to a reduction in our securities portfolio 
we also had two short term facilities available to fund our residential mortgage loan portfolio at december  these facilities totaled over billion  we had million outstanding borrowings at december   and million outstanding borrowings at december  we anticipate using these facilities  and possibly enter into new facilities  as we acquire whole loans in anticipation of a securitization 
we had three borrowing facilities for residential credit enhancement securities totaling million and two borrowing facilities for commercial mortgage loans totaling million at december  outstanding borrowings under these agreements were million at december   and million at december  at this time we see no material negative trends that we believe would affect our access to short term borrowings or bank credit lines sufficient to maintain safe operations  that would suggest that our liquidity reserves would be called upon  or that would likely cause us to be in danger of a covenant default 
however  many factors  including ones external to us  may affect our liquidity in the future 
in the first quarter of  we added borrowing facilities for our residential credit enhancement securities and our residential mortgage loans 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to find or retain sufficient borrowing agreements to fund all our potential acquisition opportunities 
under our internal risk adjusted capital system  we maintain liquidity reserves in the form of cash and unpledged liquid assets 
these liquidity reserves may be needed in the event of a decline in the market value  or a change in the acceptability to lenders of the collateral we pledge to secure short term borrowings  or for other liquidity needs 
we maintained liquidity reserves at or in excess of our policy levels during at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and highly liquid unpledged assets available to meet potential liquidity needs 
total available liquidity equaled of our short term debt balances 
at december   we had million of liquid assets  equaling of our short term debt balances 
long term debt the billion of long term debt on our december  consolidated balance sheet is non recourse debt 
substantially all this debt was issued through our special purpose financing subsidiary  sequoia  and is collateralized by residential mortgage loans 
the remaining million of this debt is backed by commercial loans and was created through the sale of senior participations 
the holders of our long term debt can look only to the cash flow from the mortgages specifically collateralizing the debt for repayment 
by using this source of financing  our liquidity risks are limited 
our special purpose financing subsidiaries that issue debt have no call on redwood s general liquidity reserves  and there is no debt rollover risk as the loans are financed to maturity 
the market for aaa rated long term debt of the type that we issue to fund residential loans through sequoia is a large  global market that has been relatively stable for many years 
at this time  we believe we could issue more of this debt on reasonable terms if we should choose to do so 
during  we sold two commercial loan participations of million 
in march  we sold an additional senior participation for million 
the market for senior participations on commercial loans of the types in our portfolio is limited and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell future participations 
equity capital and risk adjusted capital guidelines excluding short and long term collateralized debt  we are capitalized entirely by common and preferred equity capital 
our equity base increased from million to million in as a result of three equity offerings totaling million  million in asset appreciation  million in retention of cash flow  and million in stock issuance through our direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment program 
we raised another million of new capital through an equity offering in february and have raised million of capital through our direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment program in the first three months of we will seek to raise additional equity capital in the future when opportunities to expand our business are attractive and when such issuance is likely to benefit long term earnings and dividends per share 
the amount of portfolio assets that can be supported with a given capital base is limited by our internal risk adjusted capital policies 
our risk adjusted capital policy guideline amounts are expressed in terms of an equity to assets ratio and vary with market conditions and asset characteristics 
our risk adjusted capital guideline is further discussed under capital risks 
at december   our minimum capital amounts were of residential credit enhancement portfolio interests  of net retained interests in residential loan portfolio after long term debt issuance sequoia equity  of short term debt funded residential whole loans  of securities portfolio  and of commercial mortgage loan portfolio 
our total risk adjusted capital guideline amount for assets on our balance sheet was million of asset balances at december  capital required for outstanding commitments at december  for asset purchases settling later in was million 
thus  at december   our total capital committed at quarter end was million  our total capital available was million  and our excess capital to support growth in the first quarter of was million 
balance sheet leverage as reported on redwood s balance sheet of december   our equity to assets ratio was and our debt to equity ratio was times 
we believe redwood s balance sheet is generally less leveraged than many banks  savings and loans  and other financial institutions such as fannie mae and freddie mac that are in similar businesses to ours 
a majority of redwood trust s debt is non recourse debt 
holders of non recourse debt can look only to the pledged assets and not to redwood for repayment 
therefore  another useful measure of the leverage redwood employs is to compute ratios comparing redwood s equity base to its recourse debt levels and redwood s at risk assets our assets excluding those assets pledged to non recourse debt 
these adjustments generally conform redwood s balance sheet to what would be reported if redwood accounted for its securitizations as sales rather than financings 
total reported assets at december  were billion  of these  billion were pledged to non recourse debt and billion were at risk 
total reported liabilities at december  were billion  non recourse debt was billion and recourse debt was billion 
at year end  our ratio of equity to at risk assets was and our ratio of recourse debt to equity was times 
our long term plan is reduce short term recourse debt levels  in part by replacing this debt with long term non recourse debt 
if we are successful in this funding strategy  and we continue to grow  our reported leverage levels may increase at the same time that our recourse leverage levels will decrease

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage the risks inherent in all financial institutions including credit risk  liquidity risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  market value risks  and capital risks in a prudent manner designed to insure our company s longevity 
at the same time  we endeavor to provide our shareholders an opportunity to realize a high  steady  and rising dividend and an attractive total rate of return through stock ownership in our company 
in general  we seek  to the best of our ability  to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  to earn sufficient compensation to justify the taking of such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we do take 
credit risk the majority of our potential credit risk comes from high quality residential mortgage loans 
this includes residential mortgage loans we own and loans we effectively guarantee or insure through acquisitions of credit enhancement securities 
we also are exposed to potential credit risks in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio 
a small amount of our securities portfolio is currently exposed to credit risk  the bulk of this portfolio has very high credit ratings and would not normally be expected to incur credit losses 
we also have credit risk with counter parties with whom we do business 
it should be noted that the establishment of a credit reserve for gaap or a designated credit reserve under the effective yield method does not reduce our taxable income or our dividend payment obligations as a reit 
for taxable income  many of our credit expenses will be recognized only as incurred 
thus  the timing and recognition amount of credit losses for gaap and tax  and for our earnings and our dividends  may differ 
a material increase in actual credit losses may not affect our gaap income due to our reserves but could materially reduce our dividend payment obligations 
the method that we use to account for future credit losses depends upon the type of asset that we own 
for our credit enhancement securities  we establish a credit reserve upon the acquisition of such assets under the effective yield method of accounting 
in addition  first loss and other credit enhancement interests that are junior to our positions that we do not own act as a form of external credit reserve for us on a specific asset basis  these interests junior to ours will absorb credit losses in the pool of underlying mortgage loans before the principal of our interest will be affected 
for our residential and commercial mortgage loans  we establish a credit reserve based on anticipation of losses by taking credit provisions through our income statement 
most of the assets in our securities portfolio do not have material credit risk  and  thus  no credit reserves are established 
when we acquire assets for this portfolio where credit risk exists  we will establish the appropriate reserve as necessary 
liquidity risk our primary form of financing is the issuance of long term  non recourse securitized debt that very closely matches the interest rate  prepayment rate  and maturities of our assets that we pledge to secure this debt 
once we issue this debt  our recourse exposure to the underlying assets is limited to our net investment after debt issuance 
we believe this is a secure and robust form of financing that effectively eliminates liquidity risk for this portion of our balance sheet and eliminates a variety of other potential risks as well 
our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long maturity mortgage assets with short term debt 
even if the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities are well matched  maturities may not be matched 
trends in the liquidity of the capital markets in general may affect our ability to rollover short term debt 
at december   we had million of short term debt collateralized by assets 
of this debt  million was collateralized by investment grade securities  million by residential credit enhancement securities  million by commercial mortgage loans  and million by high quality residential mortgage loans under accumulation for a future securitization 
if our short term debt was called  or we could not renew lines  we may need to sell assets in an unfavorable environment 
there can be no assurance that such sales would satisfy our liabilities 
the events of september  did not impact our liquidity 
we have and continue to develop business continuity plans which may help preserve access to liquidity and help mitigate the effect of any disruptions to our operations in the event of a disaster 
as a part of our long term planning  we generally intend to reduce our short term debt levels  especially short term debt used to fund long maturity assets that we intend to retain 
we expect  under our current plan  that our primary use of short term debt will be to fund assets under accumulation for securitization 
the table below presents our contractual obligations as of december  the debt appears on our balance sheet 
the operating leases are commitments which are expensed as paid per terms of the contracts 
additional information on these obligations are presented in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
table contractual obligations all dollars in thousands stated total maturities comments short term debt  weighted average maturity is days long term debt  residential  non recourse debt amortizes as residential collateral pays down long term debt  commercial  non recourse debt amortizes as commercial collateral pays down asset purchase commitments  most acquisitions were completed in first quarter operating leases  office rent and software licenses interest rate risk our strategy is to maintain an asset liability posture that is effectively match funded so that the achievement of our long term goals is unlikely to be affected by changes in interest rates  yield curves  or mortgage prepayment rates 
at year end  the interest rate characteristics of our debt closely matched the interest rate characteristics of our assets that were funded with debt 
we had billion of adjustable rate debt matched with billion of adjustable rate assets 
we had million of equity invested primarily in fixed rate assets and working capital 
as a part of our current asset liability strategy  we have been maintaining a slight mismatch between the interest rate adjustment periods of our adjustable rate debt and our adjustable rate assets 
in effect  we own six month libor assets and  to a lesser degree  one year treasury index assets funded with one month libor debt 
the interest rate on this debt adjusts each month to the current one month libor rate plus a margin 
the interest rate on the six month libor assets adjusts more slowly to market conditions  each month  the coupon rate on approximately one sixth of these assets adjusts to the current six month libor rate plus a margin 
any single change in short term interest rates could thus have some short term effect on our earnings generally  for the next two quarters 
we would expect that the spread between our asset yields and our cost of borrowed funds would be more favorable in a falling short term interest rate environment than in a rising short term interest rate environment 
this trend may be partially or fully offset over time by the equity funded portion of our balance sheet  which would generally have increasing net interest earnings and perhaps better credit results in a rising rate environment 
in  short term interest rates fell throughout the year  and our earnings benefited from this pricing adjustment mismatch 
we would expect our spread to narrow over the next few quarters assuming interest rates stabilize or rise 
we have achieved our desired asset liability mix on balance sheet 
as the table below shows our variable rate asses are generally funded with variable rate debt and our fixed rate assets are generally funded with equity 
as a result  we have generally ceased our hedging activities 
we intend to use interest rate agreements as part of our asset liability strategy in the future when necessary to achieve our asset liability management goals

changes in interest rates can have many affects on our business aside from those discussed in this section  including affecting our liquidity  market values  and mortgage prepayment rates 
prepayment risk we seek to maintain an asset liability posture that mitigates the effects that mortgage prepayment trends may have on our ability to achieve our long term objectives 
for the development of our business  there are positive and negative aspects to both slow prepayment rate environments and fast prepayment rate environments 
in general  it would be difficult to say which scenario would be preferred over the longer term 
prepayments affect short term gaap earnings primarily through amortization of purchase premium and discount 
although we have roughly equal amounts of premium and discount  variations in a specific asset s current and long term estimated prepayment rates and differing accounting methods for various types of assets can cause earnings fluctuations as individual asset prepayment rates change 
table unamortized premium and discount balances all dollars in thousands net net gross gross premium amortization premium discount discount expense q    q    q     q    q    q     q     q     we could have material net premium amortization expenses even if we do not have a high net premium balance 
this could occur because our premium mortgage assets generally prepay at a faster rate than do our discount mortgage assets  and because the yields of our premium assets are generally more sensitive to changes in prepayment rates than are the yields of our discount assets 
yields for most of our assets are affected both by estimated future long term prepayment rates and by current prepayment rates 
market value risk at december   we owned mortgage securities and loans totaling million that we account for on a mark to market basis in the case of mortgage loans  on a lower of cost or market basis for purposes of determining reported earnings 
of these assets  had adjustable rate coupons 
market value fluctuations for our assets not only affect our reported earnings  but also can affect our liquidity  especially to the extent these assets are funded with short term borrowings 
we currently do not have a significant number of interest rate agreements  such agreements are reported at market value  with any periodic changes reported either through the income statement or our balance sheet 
furthermore  under sfas  certain assets whose market value changes are not currently reported through the income statement may have such changes reported through the income statement if such assets are hedged 
at december   we owned million of assets that were marked to market through our balance sheet but not our income statement 
market value fluctuations of these assets can affect the reported value of our stockholders equity base 
capital risk our capital levels  and thus our access to borrowings and liquidity  may be tested  particularly if the market value of our assets securing our short term borrowings declines or the market for short term borrowings changes in an adverse manner 
through our risk adjusted capital policy  we assign a guideline capital adequacy amount  expressed as a guideline equity to assets ratio  to each of our mortgage assets 
for short term funded assets  this ratio will fluctuate over time  based on changes in that asset s credit quality  liquidity characteristics  potential for market value fluctuation  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  and the over collateralization requirements for that asset set by our collateralized short term lenders 
capital requirements for securities rated below aa  residential credit enhancement interests  retained interests from our sequoia securitizations of our residential retained portfolio assets  commercial mortgage whole loans  and retained commercial mortgage junior participants are generally higher than for higher rated securities and residential whole loans 
capital requirements for less liquid assets depend chiefly on our access to secure funding for these assets  the number of sources of such funding  the funding terms  and on the amount of extra capital we decide to hold on hand to protect against possible liquidity events with these assets 
capital requirements for most of our retained interests in sequoia generally equal our net investment 
the sum of the capital adequacy amounts for all of our mortgage assets is our aggregate capital adequacy guideline amount 
we do not expect that our actual capital levels will always exceed the guideline amount 
if interest rates were to rise in a significant manner  our capital guideline amount may rise  as the potential interest rate risk of our assets would increase  at least on a temporary basis  due to periodic and life caps and slowing prepayment rates for mortgage assets 
we measure all of our assets funded with short term debt at estimated market value for the purpose of making risk adjusted capital calculations 
our actual capital levels  as determined for the risk adjusted capital policy  would likely fall as rates increase and as the market values of our assets  net of mark to market gains on hedges  decrease 
such market value declines may be temporary  as future coupon adjustments on adjustable rate mortgage loans may help to restore some of the lost market value 
in this circumstance  or any other circumstance in which our actual capital levels decreased below our capital adequacy guideline amount  we would generally cease the acquisition of new assets until capital balance was restored through prepayments  interest rate changes  or other means 
in certain cases prior to a planned equity offering or other circumstances  the board of directors may authorize management to acquire assets in a limited amount beyond the usual constraints of our risk adjusted capital policy 
inflation risk virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates  changes in interest rates  and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and  as a reit  our dividends must equal at least of our net reit income as calculated for tax purposes 
in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
quantitative information about market risk the table below incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market value risks on our balance sheet 
one scenario regarding potential future principal repayments and interest rates of our assets and liabilities is presented in the table 
there are many assumptions used to generate this information and there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as anticipated 
future sales  principal repayments  acquisitions  calls  and restructurings could materially change our interest rate risk profile 
as discussed throughout this form k  many factors will affect our earnings 
for our interest rate sensitive assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of maturity 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets as of december  was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented  based on the existing characteristics of the portfolio 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of these assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with this scenario  actual prepayments speeds could vary significantly from these assumptions 
furthermore  this table does not include anticipated credit losses and assumes all of the principal we are entitled to receive will be received
