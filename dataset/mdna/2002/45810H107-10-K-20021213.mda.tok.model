the company has an established domestic and international customer base that includes government and commercial satellite operators  spacecraft and payload manufacturers  and aerospace systems integrators 
the company has developed innovative software products that reduce the cost and minimize the development risk associated with traditional custom built systems 
the company believes that it was the first to offer a comprehensive cots software product line for command and control

the company believes that inflation did not have a material impact on the company s revenues or income from operations in fiscal years   and forward looking statements certain of the statements contained in the business section  in other parts of this k  and in this section  including those under the headings outlook and liquidity and capital resources  are forward looking 
in addition  from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments  new products  research and development activities and similar matters 
forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue  or other similar words  including statements as to the intent  belief  or current expectations of the company and its directors  officers  and management with respect to the company s future operations  performance  or positions or which contain other forward looking information 
these forward looking statements are predictions 
no assurances can be given that the future results indicated  whether expressed or implied  will be achieved 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
while the company believes that these statements are and will be accurate  a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s statements 
the company s business is dependent upon general economic conditions and upon various conditions specific to its industry  and future trends cannot be predicted with certainty 
particular risks and uncertainties that may effect the company s business  other than those described elsewhere herein  include the following 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts or subcontracts funded by the us government  which are subject to termination without cause  government regulations and audits  competitive bidding  and the budget and funding process of the us government 

the presence of competitors with greater financial resources and their strategic response to the company s new services 

the potential obsolescence of the company s services due to the introduction of new technologies 

the response of customers to the company s marketing strategies and services 

the company s commercial contracts are subject to strict performance and other requirements 

the intense competition in the satellite ground system industry could harm our financial performance 

risks related to the company s acquisition strategy 
in particular  the company may not be able to find any attractive candidates or it may find that the acquisition terms proposed by potential acquisition candidates are not favorable to the company 
in addition  the company may compete with other companies for these acquisition candidates  which competition may make an acquisition more expensive for the company 
if the company is unable to identify and acquire any suitable candidates  the company may not be able to find alternative uses for the cash proceeds of its previous private placements that improve the company s business  financial conditions  or results of operations to the extent that an acquisition could 
in addition  if the company is able to identify and acquire one or more businesses  the integration of the acquired business or businesses may be costly and may result in a decrease in the value of the company s common stock for the following reasons  among others 
the company may not adequately assess the risks inherent in a particular acquisition candidate or correctly assess the candidate s potential contribution to the company s financial performance  
the company may need to divert more management resources to integration than it planned  which may adversely affect its ability to pursue other more profitable activities  
the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  integrating personnel with disparate backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures  
the company may not eliminate as many redundant costs as it anticipated in selecting acquisition candidates  and an acquisition candidate may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that the company failed to discover through its due diligence prior to the acquisition 

changes in activity levels in the company s core markets 
while sometimes presented with numerical specificity  these forward looking statements are based upon a variety of assumptions relating to the business of the company  which although considered reasonable by the company  may not be realized 
because of the number and range of the assumptions underlying the company s forward looking statements  many of which are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies beyond the reasonable control of the company  some of the assumptions inevitably will not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur subsequent to the date of this document 
these forward looking statements are based on current information and expectation  and the company assumes no obligation to update 
therefore  the actual experience of the company and the results achieved during the period covered by any particular forward looking statement should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that these estimates will be realized  and actual results may vary materially 
there can be no assurance that any of these expectations will be realized or that any of the forward looking statements contained herein will prove to be accurate
