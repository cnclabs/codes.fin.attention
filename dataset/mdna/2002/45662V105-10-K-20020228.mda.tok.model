item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we were founded in  and during the early years of our operations we focused primarily on developing and selling diagnostics tools for a predecessor to the signaling system  or ss  signaling protocol 
as the telecommunications industry increasingly adopted ss  we shifted our focus to developing and deploying ss based solutions as well as broadening our product offerings 
our diagnostics solution  spectra  was first introduced in december and is currently in its tenth generation release 
beginning in  we focused a significant portion of our product development efforts on developing a complete monitoring and surveillance solution for ss networks  culminating in the introduction of our network intelligence solution  the geoprobe  in late since the introduction of the geoprobe  we have continued to add capabilities and applications within our network intelligence solutions area 
in late and through early  we introduced a suite of business intelligence solutions called it seven 
these applications enable carriers to protect and generate additional revenues and reduce capital or operating expenses within their networks by managing the performance of services delivered through their networks and the points of interconnection with networks of other carriers 
since the initial introduction of our it seven suite of business intelligence applications  we have continued to add new capabilities and applications within this solution area 
in  we introduced the spectra mg  a diagnostic tool to address next generation networks 
we continue to focus significant resources on the development of new products as well as enhancements  new features and new applications for all of our existing product areas 
historically  we have generated substantially all of our revenues from sales of our network intelligence and diagnostics solutions 
revenues attributable to the geoprobe have represented a majority of our total revenues since we expect revenues from our network intelligence and business intelligence offerings to represent a majority of our revenues in future periods given the relatively higher growth rates expected for these solutions 
our remaining revenues are derived from services relating to these products 
these services include training  warranty and product support 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations years ended december  revenues product and license fees services total revenues cost of revenues product and license fees services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring costs total operating expenses income loss from operations other income income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income includes a gain of million from the sale of our wireless data assets in september revenues product and license fees 
revenues from product and license fees decreased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in in  the decline in revenues from product and license fees was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes in all areas of our business  which reflected a decrease in demand for our solutions 
this decrease was primarily driven by the general slowdown in the economy  and the decreased levels of spending within the telecommunications sector 
we also experienced relatively lower sales prices for certain basic applications within our network intelligence solutions area  which is expected as applications mature or are duplicated in competitor offerings 
prices for new applications or applications for which there are no significant competitive offerings are typically stable  which was the case in in  the growth in revenues from product and license fees was primarily due to an increase in our installed customer base for our network intelligence solutions and an increase in unit sales of our diagnostics solutions 
services 
revenues from services increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the increase in services revenues was due to an increase in our number of customers and a larger installed base of products with existing customers for which we provide product support services 
in  we added approximately new network intelligence and business intelligence solutions customers 
in  we expect revenues from services to increase from levels because of a larger installed base of products driven by both new and existing customers 
however  we expect the rate of increase to be less than that experienced from to because of an industry wide focus on decreasing support costs and the economies of scale pricing for customers with a large footprint of our solutions 
concentration of revenues 
in  revenues from deutsche telekom accounted for approximately of total revenues 
in  revenues from british telecom and worldcom each accounted for approximately of total revenues 
no individual customer accounted for or more of total revenues in a large percentage of our revenues are typically derived from a small number of customers  the specific make up of which varies from one quarter to the next 
on a quarterly basis  our largest customers typically account for to of total revenues for that quarter 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
international revenues 
international revenues accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in revenues from emea accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in variations in the percentage of total revenues derived from international markets may occur as a result of the economic conditions in the regions in which we operate and the concentration of revenues in a particular period from a small number of customers 
in  we expect revenues from international markets to continue to represent the majority of our total revenues 
cost of revenues product and license fees 
cost of product and license fees consists primarily of hardware  personnel and overhead expenses related to the manufacturing  integration and installation of our products 
cost of product and license fees was million in  million in and million in  representing of product and license fees revenues in  of product and license fees revenues in and of product and license fees revenues in during  the increase in absolute dollars over the prior year was primarily due to increased personnel expenses  increased expenses associated with a higher level of installation contract labor and increased reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  mitigated somewhat by decreased hardware costs attributable to lower sales volumes 
the increase in as a percentage of product and license fees revenues was primarily attributable to these same factors as well as the decreased level of revenues 
during  the increase in absolute dollars over the prior year resulted primarily from additional hardware costs and related installation expenses associated with increased sales volumes 
the decrease as a percentage of product and license fees revenues in was primarily attributable to a higher percentage of revenues being derived from more profitable expansions of existing systems versus new system installations 
new product offerings or changes in our product mix  in terms of both solution area and proportion of new systems versus system expansions  can affect the cost of revenues as a percentage of product and license fees revenues 
services 
cost of services consists of expenses  primarily personnel costs  related to our product support  training  and warranty and non warranty activities 
cost of services was million in  million in and million in  representing of services revenues in  of services revenues in and of services revenues in historically  cost of services as a percentage of services revenues has fluctuated as a result of the relative mix of product support  training and warranty and non warranty work during a specific period 
we expect this variability will continue into the foreseeable future 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  including incentive and other compensation expenses  and contract labor  travel and facilities expenses 
these expenses were million in  million in and million in  representing of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in the increase in absolute dollars in compared to was primarily due to increased average headcount  higher average wage levels required to retain qualified technical and engineering personnel and greater use of epygi technologies  ltd 
for third party research and development services 
the increase as a percentage of total revenues in was attributable to these same factors coupled with the decreased level of revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in compared to was primarily related to increased average headcount 
our research and development efforts include expenditures for new products and applications  and new features or enhancements for existing products  primarily in the areas of next generation wireless and packet based technologies 
software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant  and we have not capitalized any software development costs 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel  travel and facilities expenses as well as marketing expenses such as trade show and advertising expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in  representing of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in the decrease in absolute dollars in compared to was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales commissions  due to lower order levels  and cost reduction efforts primarily related to promotional activities 
the increase as a percentage of total revenues in was primarily attributable to the decreased level of revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in compared to was primarily attributable to higher average headcount  increased commissions  expansion of international sales activities and increased marketing and promotional activities 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel  facilities and legal and professional expenses of our finance  administrative and executive departments 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in  representing of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in the decrease in absolute dollars in compared to was primarily related to decreased incentive compensation  decreased average headcount and decreased professional fees 
the increase as a percentage of total revenues in was attributable to the decreased level of revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars in compared to was primarily attributable to increased average headcount and facility related expansion efforts associated with the growth of our business 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues during primarily due to higher revenues 
restructuring costs 
we recorded a restructuring charge for the three months ended march  of approximately million related primarily to a workforce reduction of approximately employees 
the reduction affected all areas of the company 
the charge consisted primarily of employee severance  professional fees and outplacement services 
in the fourth quarter of  we decreased this charge by million due to changes in previous estimates related to severance and professional fees 
at december   we had paid all costs associated with this workforce reduction 
in may  we announced our decision to refocus our strategy and streamline operations to reduce our cost structure in response to the generally weakened economic environment and changing demand characteristics in some of our markets 
as part of this decision  we discontinued all efforts with respect to our via softswitch offering and reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
the reduction affected all areas of the company 
we recorded a restructuring charge for the three months ended june  of approximately million  which consisted of employee severance of approximately million  professional fees and outplacement services of approximately million and the write off of assets related to the via softswitch of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we decreased this charge by million due to changes in previous estimates related to professional fees 
at december   the balance of these costs that remained to be paid totaled approximately million  consisting primarily of employee severance  professional fees and costs related to excess facilities 
we expect to substantially pay these amounts prior to june other income other income is primarily interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
other income was million in  million in and million in the decrease during compared to was primarily attributable to the overall decrease in interest rates paid on our investments 
in  we recognized a return on our average cash balance of compared to in the decrease in compared to resulted from a million gain on the sale of our wireless data assets realized in excluding this gain  the increase in other income in resulted from increased interest earned on higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents  which resulted from proceeds from our may initial public offering  proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans and increased income from operations 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in compared to income tax expense of million in and million in our effective income tax rates were in and in and the effective annualized tax rate for differed from the statutory corporate tax rate primarily due to our lower level of income combined with the effect of tax benefits such as the utilization of the research and development tax credit 
in  the effective tax rate benefit of varies from the us statutory rate primarily due to the effect of our foreign sales corporation and the utilization of the research and development tax credit 
we recorded a tax benefit resulting in related net deferred tax assets of million as of december   reflecting credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based on the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected taxable income 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets actually realized  however  could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income 
sale of inet global research  llc effective january   we sold our membership interest in inet global research  llc to epygi technologies  ltd  or epygi  an entity controlled by samuel s 
simonian  one of our founders and the chairman of our board  for a cash purchase price of  no gain or loss was recorded for the sale 
this transaction was approved by the independent members of our board of directors 
epygi is currently performing development services for us for which it is paid a monthly fee per full time programmer plus reimbursement of reasonable business expenses 
we paid approximately million for these services for the year ended december   and approximately million for the year ended december  sale of wireless data assets in september  we sold our wireless data product line and related assets to nextcell  inc now known as enfora  inc  an entity controlled by mark a 
weinzierl  one of our founders and a director  for a cash purchase price of million 
a special committee of our independent directors approved the transaction 
in  we recorded a pre tax gain of million and an after tax gain of million  or per share on a diluted basis 
excluding the gain on the sale of the wireless data assets  our diluted earnings per share were for revenues from the wireless data product line were approximately million from january   through the date of sale 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have funded our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through cash flows from operations and to a lesser extent during our initial years of operations through bank borrowings 
at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december   an increase of million from million in cash and cash equivalents at december  at december   we had no long term debt 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in operating cash flows in increased primarily due to collections on trade accounts receivable and receipt of an income tax refund 
operating cash flows in decreased primarily due to increased accounts receivable  increased inventory and increased income taxes receivable 
cash used in investing activities was million in and million in compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in net cash used in investing activities in and was related to purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities in resulted from proceeds from the sale of our wireless data assets of million less cash used to purchase property and equipment of approximately million 
financing activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities in and related to proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
net cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from proceeds from our initial public offering 
our revolving credit facility expired on august  we believe that our current cash balances are sufficient for our near term needs  and we therefore chose not to renew or replace the facility 
at december   we had material commitments for our operating leases  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  including commitments of approximately million relating to we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
in  we expect capital expenditures to be similar to levels experienced in we may in the future pursue acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies  or enter into joint venture arrangements  that could complement or expand our business and product offerings 
any material acquisition or joint venture could result in a decrease in our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
we believe that current cash balances and expected future cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and other activities through thereafter  if current sources are not sufficient to meet our needs  we may seek additional equity or debt financing 
in addition  any material acquisition of other businesses  products or technologies or material investments in joint ventures could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results 
we consider the following accounting policies as those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ  and such differences could be significant to our financial results 
revenue recognition general 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of products and software license fees as well as services  which include training  warranty and product support services 
the majority of the contracts for our network intelligence and business intelligence solutions contain multiple billing milestones eg  contract award  shipment  installation and acceptance  not all of which are associated with revenue recognition 
except as otherwise discussed below  revenues from product and license fees are recognized in the period that we have completed all hardware manufacturing and or software development to contractual specifications  factory testing has been completed  the product has been shipped to the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable 
when we have significant obligations subsequent to shipment  such as installation and system integration  revenues are recognized when there are no significant unfulfilled obligations 
revenues from arrangements that include significant acceptance terms and or provisions are recognized when acceptance has occurred 
revenues from our diagnostics solutions are typically recognized upon shipment 
multiple element arrangements 
contracts for our network intelligence and business intelligence solutions are typically multiple element arrangements  which means they involve multiple deliverables 
we determine the fair value of each of the contract deliverables using vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
vsoe for each element is based on the price that we would sell the element to the customer on a stand alone basis 
we offer our customers product support services  which include the correction of software problems  telephone access to our technical personnel and the right to receive unspecified product updates  upgrades and enhancements  when and if they become available 
revenues from these services  including product warranty services included in initial licensing fees  are recognized ratably over the contract period 
product warranty services included in the initial licensing fee are allocated from the total contract amount based on the relative fair value of these services determined using vsoe 
revenues from other services  such as training  are recognized when the services have been completed 
if we determine that we do not have vsoe on an undelivered element of an arrangement  we would not be able to recognize revenue until all elements of the arrangement were delivered 
this occurrence could materially impact our financial results because of the significant dollar amount of many of our contracts and the significant portion of total revenues that a single contract may represent in any particular period 
percentage of completion accounting 
revenues for contracts that require significant software development and are generally in duration in excess of nine months are recognized using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract costs 
we believe that this method is appropriate because of our ability to determine performance milestones and determine dependable estimates of our costs applicable to each phase of a contract 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contract  costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revenues from these contracts are recognized upon attainment of the scheduled performance milestones 
revisions in gross margin estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
favorable changes in estimates result in improved gross margins  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in lower gross margins 
anticipated losses on fixed price contracts are recognized through cost of revenues when estimable 
less than of our revenues from  and was attributable to contracts under percentage of completion accounting 
had our estimates of the costs to complete all contracts accounted for under percentage of completion accounting been higher at december   our gross margins would have been unfavorably impacted by approximately million 
to date  we have not recorded significant adjustments to revenues and expenses as a result of changes in estimates on long term contracts 
returns and cancellations 
generally  our contracts do not include right of return clauses 
as a result  we have experienced few returns or cancellations for our products 
revenues on contracts that include right of return clauses are not recognized until the right of return period has expired 
accordingly  we do not record a provision for returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts a large proportion of our revenues and receivables are attributable to our carrier customers in the telecommunications industry and  to a lesser extent  to our customers who supply equipment into the telecommunications industry 
our trade accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from our customers 
because our accounts receivable are typically unsecured  we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our accounts based on a combination of factors  including a particular customer s ability to pay as well as the age of the receivables 
to evaluate a specific customer s ability to pay  we analyze financial statements  payment history  third party credit analysis reports and various information or disclosures by the customer or other publicly available information 
in cases where the evidence suggests a customer may not be able to satisfy its obligation to us  we set up a specific reserve in an amount we determine appropriate for the perceived risk 
most of our contracts include multiple payment milestones  some of which occur in advance of revenue recognition  which mitigates our risk both in terms of collectibility and adjustments to recorded revenue 
given that most of our customers are large public companies with substantial resources  we have not historically experienced significant losses on uncollectible accounts and our allowance has been less than of recorded receivables 
if the current downturn in the telecommunications industry continues  the financial condition of our customers could deteriorate and they may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us 
if this were to occur  the net value realized from our receivables may be materially different from the net balance recorded on our balance sheet 
inventory reserves inventories are recorded net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis the status of our inventory to ensure the amount recorded in our financial statements reflects the lower of our cost or the value we expect to receive when we sell the inventory 
this estimate is based on several factors  including the condition and salability of our inventory and the forecasted demand for the particular products incorporating these components 
based on current backlog and expected orders  we forecast the upcoming usage of current stock 
we recognize reserves for obsolete and slow moving parts ranging from for active parts with sufficient forecasted demand up to for excess parts with insufficient demand or obsolete parts 
if market conditions deteriorate or the expected future demand for our products otherwise decreases  or if changes in our business strategy reduce our need for these components  our estimate of the carrying value of our inventory could be reduced by a material amount 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations initiated after june   be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and certain intangible assets from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
at december   we did not have any goodwill or intangible assets which will be subject to sfas and  accordingly  adoption of these standards will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which we adopted january  sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know  or that we currently view as immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  they could materially harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our quarterly financial results fluctuate and are difficult to predict 
since our future financial results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  you should not rely on our results of operations during any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance in any quarterly period or fiscal year 
our quarterly financial results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include but are not limited to the size  timing and terms of specific orders by our customers  the timing of the delivery to and the installation and acceptance of our products by our customers  the mix of products and services sold by us  the relative percentages of products sold through our direct and indirect sales channels  customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products  the timing of and level of our investments in research and development activities  and the timing of and magnitude of our sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  changes in  and our ability to implement  our strategy  and other risks described below 
a significant portion of our operating expenses  including rent and salaries  is largely fixed in nature 
accordingly  if revenues are below expectations  our financial results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected because these operating expenses are not variable in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to unanticipated decreases in revenues 
our financial results are also likely to fluctuate due to factors that impact our current and prospective customers 
expenditures by customers tend to vary in cycles that reflect overall economic conditions and individual budgeting and buying patterns and  in some cases  the ability of some of our customers to obtain the financing they require to make capital expenditures 
our business has been adversely affected by a softening economy  and we would be further harmed by a continued decline in the economic prospects of our customers or the economy in general 
in many cases  these adverse economic conditions have altered current and prospective customers capital spending priorities or budget cycles  or extended our sales cycle  and these adverse effects could continue 
our business also could be harmed by changes in customer spending patterns reflecting industry trends 
in addition  our financial results historically have been influenced by seasonal fluctuations  with revenues tending to be strongest in the fourth quarter of each year and revenues in our first quarter tending to be consistent with  or decreasing from  the level achieved in the preceding quarter 
we believe that this seasonality has been due to the capital appropriation practices of many of our customers  however  it is unclear how these historical trends will be affected by the overall slowdown in the telecommunications industry 
as a result of all of the foregoing  we cannot assure you that our revenues will grow in future periods or that we will be profitable 
in addition  in some future quarters our financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts 
in such event  the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
our revenues are highly concentrated among a small number of customers 
a large percentage of our revenues are typically derived from a small number of customers 
for example  in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers  with deutsche telekom accounting for approximately of total revenues  and in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers  with british telecom and worldcom each accounting for approximately of total revenues 
we have historically experienced similar concentrations on a quarterly basis  and we expect this trend to continue 
although the customer make up of our largest projects varies from quarter to quarter  a number of customers  including those listed above  frequently account for a significant portion of our revenues in a given period 
if one or more of our significant customers experiences adverse conditions in its industry or operations  including the continued impact of the current economic downturn  these customers may not be able to meet their ongoing financial obligations or complete the purchase of additional products 
consolidations in the telecommunications industry or a further slowdown in telecommunications spending could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have derived substantially all of our revenues from sales of products and related services to the telecommunications industry 
since early  we and a number of other companies have been impacted by reduced spending by telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in the event that conditions continue to worsen in our industry or in the event there are consolidations of our current or prospective customers 
slowdowns in spending often cause delays in sales and installations and could cause cancellations of current or planned projects  any of which could harm our financial results in a particular period 
changes or delays in the implementation or customer acceptance of our products could harm our financial results 
revenues for our network intelligence and business intelligence solutions are typically recognized upon the completion of installation  or when we have no significant additional obligations 
on a quarterly basis  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customer projects 
customer or inet caused delays in the commencement or completion of scheduled product installations  which from time to time result from site readiness delays  insufficient resources or other issues  and lengthening of implementation schedules due to the introduction of new features or applications  could materially harm our financial results 
with respect to contracts providing for a significant payment or performance milestone tied to customer acceptance or allowing customer return  termination or similar rights prior to acceptance  revenue will generally not be recognized until acceptance 
for new products  we typically recognize revenue upon acceptance until a track record of acceptance is achieved  after which revenue recognition generally is tied to the completion of installation 
in cases where the recognition of revenue is tied to customer acceptance  the failure to obtain acceptance or delayed acceptance could harm our expected financial results for a particular period 
additionally  we may be subject to penalties for a failure to meet contractually agreed upon milestones or deadlines 
any reversal or slowdown in deregulation of telecommunications markets could materially harm the markets for our products 
future growth in the markets for our products will depend in part on continued privatization  deregulation and the restructuring of telecommunications markets worldwide  as the demand for our products is generally higher when a competitive environment exists 
any reversal or slowdown in the pace of this privatization  deregulation or restructuring could materially harm the markets for our products 
moreover  the consequences of deregulation are subject to many uncertainties  including judicial and administrative proceedings that affect the pace at which the changes contemplated by deregulation occur  and other regulatory  economic and political factors 
any invalidation  repeal or modification of the requirements imposed by the telecommunications act of  the local telephone competition rules adopted by the us federal communications commission to implement that act or similar international regulation could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the uncertainties associated with deregulation have in the past  and could in the future  cause our customers to delay purchasing decisions pending the resolution of these uncertainties 
the sales cycle for our products is long  which could harm our quarterly financial results 
sales of our network intelligence and business intelligence products and solutions are made predominately to large communications service providers and involve significant capital expenditures and lengthy implementation processes 
sales to this type of customer generally require an extensive sales effort throughout the customer s organization and final approval by an executive officer or other senior level approval 
we expend substantial funds and management effort pursuing these sales 
additionally  potential customers often maintain comprehensive processes for internal approval  contracting  procurement  testing and acceptance  which may cause potential sales to be delayed or foregone 
as a result of these and other factors  the sales cycle for our solutions is long  historically ranging from six to months for our network intelligence and business intelligence solutions excluding the cycle for subsequent applications and enhancements  which varies widely and up to three months for occasional  large sales of our diagnostics solutions 
in addition  we have experienced lengthening sales cycles during the current soft economy 
accordingly  our ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales is limited  and the deferral or loss of one or more significant sales could materially harm anticipated financial results in a particular quarter  especially if there are significant sales and marketing expenses associated with any deferred or lost sales 
any decrease in demand for our products would significantly decrease our sales 
our principal products  the geoprobe  it seven and spectra  generate substantially all of our revenues today and are expected to continue to account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our business has been adversely affected by a softening economy  and we would be further harmed by a continued decline in the economic prospects of our customers or the economy in general 
any further downturn in the demand for our products would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing any other products or taking any other steps to reduce the risk associated with any slowdown in demand for the geoprobe  it seven and or spectra 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share 
competition for all of our solutions is intense and is expected to continue and in some cases intensify in the future 
we compete with a number of us and international suppliers that vary in size  and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
certain of our competitors have  in relation to us  longer operating histories  larger installed customer bases  longer standing relationships with customers  greater name recognition and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service  public relations  distribution and other resources 
additionally  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
as a result  these competitors may be able to more quickly develop or adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share 
our business depends on retaining our existing key personnel 
our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key senior managers  technical personnel and sales and marketing personnel  few of whom are bound by an employment agreement 
the loss of any existing key personnel  or the inability to attract  motivate and retain additional key personnel  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to adapt to rapid technological change and evolving customer requirements 
the introduction of communications network management products involving superior technologies or the evolution of alternative technologies or new industry protocol standards could render our existing products  as well as products currently under development  obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability  on a timely and cost effective basis  to continue to enhance our network intelligence  business intelligence and diagnostics solutions  develop and introduce new products or applications for the communications market  keep pace with evolving industry protocol standards and changing customer needs  and achieve broad market acceptance for our products 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve these objectives 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products based on emerging technologies 
we expect carrier spending for legacy networks to decrease over time  which requires that we develop solutions for networks based on emerging packet technologies and standards  such as ip and atm 
we may not successfully develop competitive products for these technologies and standards  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
products as complex as those currently under development by us frequently are subject to delays  and we cannot assure you that we will not encounter difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful and timely development  introduction and marketing of these potential new products 
even if such potential new products are developed and introduced  we cannot assure you that they will achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
half or more of our revenues have historically come from our international customers  and  as a result  our business may be harmed by political and economic conditions in foreign markets and the challenges associated with operating internationally 
a substantial portion of our business is subject to the risks inherent in international business activities  including management of geographically dispersed operations  a longer sales cycle  especially on initial entry into a new geographical market  greater difficulty in evaluating a customer s ability to pay  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and greater difficulty in the collection of past due accounts  difficulty in establishing and maintaining relationships with government owned or subsidized communications providers  general economic conditions in each country  currency controls and exchange rate fluctuations  seasonal reductions in business activity specific to certain markets  loss of revenues  property and equipment from expropriation  nationalization  war  insurrection  terrorism and other political risks  foreign taxes and the overlap of different tax structures  including modifications to the us tax code as a result of international trade regulations  greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  import and export licensing requirements and other trade restrictions  involuntary renegotiation of contracts with foreign governments and communications carriers  and existence or adoption of laws and regulations affecting the pace of deregulation  taxation of our business and the general business climate for foreign companies 
continued international expansion of our business would require further significant management attention and financial resources 
this expansion may be costly and time consuming and may not generate returns for a significant period of time  if at all 
additionally  in order to further expand internationally  we may be required to establish relationships with additional distributors and third party integrators 
we cannot assure you that we will effectively establish such relationships 
if international revenues are not adequate to offset the additional expenses of expanding international operations  it could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  a very high percentage of our international sales have been denominated in us dollars  and we have not been significantly exposed to fluctuations in non us currency exchange rates 
as a result  our revenues in international markets may be negatively impacted by a strengthening us dollar 
however  we expect that in future periods a greater portion of international sales may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars  thereby exposing us to exchange rate gains and losses on non us currency transactions 
we may choose to limit such exposure by entering into various hedging arrangements 
we cannot be certain that any hedging strategies that we undertake would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
we may be unable to produce sufficient quantities of our products because we obtain various key components from sole and limited source suppliers 
if we are unable to obtain these components or if the prices of these components increase  we could be unable to ship our products in a timely manner or our product costs could be materially impacted 
we could experience delays or reductions in product shipments or increases in product costs if we are unable to obtain sufficient key components as required or to develop alternative sources if and as required in the future 
currently  our products utilize various semiconductors that are available from only one manufacturer and other components that are available from only one or a limited number of suppliers 
while alternative suppliers have been identified for a variety of key components  those alternative sources have not been qualified or activated by us 
our qualification process could be lengthy  and we cannot assure you that additional sources would become available to us on a timely basis  or if such sources were to become available  that the components would be comparable in price and quality to our current components 
we have no long term agreements with our suppliers and  in the case of many components  make our purchases with purchase orders on an as needed basis 
certain components require long order lead times  in certain cases up to nine months 
other components that currently are readily available may become difficult to obtain in the future 
our failure to order sufficient quantities of these components in advance of product delivery deadlines could prevent us from adequately responding to unanticipated increases in customer orders 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the receipt of a variety of our key components  which have resulted in delays in product deliveries 
in addition  the cost of various key components of our products has fluctuated significantly in the past based on supply and demand factors 
significant changes in supply and demand characteristics in the future could cause the cost of various components to increase  which could adversely impact our product costs 
our inventory may become obsolete or unusable 
we make advance purchases of various component parts in relatively large quantities to ensure that we have an adequate and readily available supply 
our failure to accurately project our needs for these components and the demand for our products that incorporate them  or changes in our business strategy that reduce our need for these components could result in these components becoming obsolete prior to their intended use or otherwise unusable in our business 
we rely on third party subcontractors to manufacture and develop our products 
our ability to sell products to our customers could be impaired if these subcontractors do not meet their commitments to us 
any disruption in our relationships with third party subcontractors and our inability to develop alternative sources if and as required in the future could result in delays or reductions in product shipments or increases in product costs 
we rely exclusively upon third party subcontractors to manufacture our subassemblies  and we have retained  from time to time  third party design services in the development of application specific integrated circuits and the layout of circuit boards 
we also frequently subcontract the development of specific features and enhancements of our products 
our reliance on third party subcontractors involves a number of risks  including the potential absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of or interruption in access to various process technologies  and reduced control over product quality  delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
we rely upon software licensed from third parties 
if we are unable to maintain these software licenses on commercially reasonable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we rely upon software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with our internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
the inability to maintain any software licenses on commercially reasonable terms could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent software could be developed or licensed and integrated into our products  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not receive the intended benefits of future acquisitions  joint ventures or other business relationships 
we may in the future pursue acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  or the establishment of joint venture  strategic partnership or other arrangements that could expand our business 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic relationships  as well as the integration of an acquired or jointly developed business  technology or product  could cause diversion of management s time and resources 
future acquisitions and strategic relationships by us could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  a material reduction in cash reserves  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  research and development write offs and other acquisition related expenses 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition or joint venture will be successfully integrated with our operations 
if we were to pursue any such acquisition or strategic relationship  we may not receive the intended benefits of the acquisition or strategic relationship 
also  we have in the past and may in the future pursue arrangements with third parties to perform specified activities for us such as the development of products or product features 
we cannot assure you that these arrangements will produce to the level of quality or in the time frame expected  which could materially harm our business 
we may be accused of infringing the proprietary rights of others  which could subject us to costly and time consuming litigation 
the communications industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent allegations of patent infringement 
we have received  and may receive in the future  notices from holders of patents that raise issues as to possible infringement by our products 
currently  we are engaged in correspondence and discussions with one third party patent holder 
as the number of competitive products increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we believe that we may become increasingly subject to allegations of infringement 
while we believe that our products do not infringe on any valid patents  questions of infringement and the validity of patents in the field of communications signaling technologies involve highly technical and subjective analyses 
we cannot assure you that any patent holders will not initiate legal proceedings in the future against us  or that if any proceedings were initiated  we would be successful in defending ourselves 
any proceeding could be time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve  result in substantial diversion of management resources  cause product shipment delays  or force us to enter into royalty or license agreements rather than dispute the merits of any such proceeding initiated against us 
we cannot assure you that any such royalty or license agreements would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our limited ability or failure to protect our intellectual property may materially harm our ability to compete 
our continued success is dependent in part upon our proprietary technology 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of technical innovation  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure agreements and  to a lesser extent  patents  each of which affords only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights in the products to the same extent as do the laws of the us despite the measures taken by us  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology and information without authorization 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
any litigation could be time consuming and expensive to prosecute or resolve  result in substantial diversion of management resources  and materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary technology or that our proprietary rights will provide us a meaningful competitive advantage 
we may face potential liability for product defects 
products as complex as ours may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released that  despite our testing  are not discovered until after a product has been installed and used by customers 
defects or errors could result in delayed market acceptance of the product or damage to our reputation and business 
we generally include provisions in our agreements with customers that are intended to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising out of defects or errors in our products 
however  the nature and extent of these limitations vary from agreement to agreement and it is possible that these limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or current or future laws enacted in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
although we have not experienced any product liability suits to date  the sale and support of our products entail the risk of these claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  regardless of its merit  could result in material expense to us  diversion of management time and attention  and damage to our business reputation and our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
our three founders own approximately of our common stock  which allows them to control the management and affairs of our company and prevent a change of control 
as of december   our three founders  samuel s 
simonian  elie s 
akilian and mark a 
weinzierl  beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
consequently  two or more of these individuals  acting together could effectively control the outcome of all matters submitted for stockholder action  including the election of our board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
they effectively control the management and affairs of our company  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 
in addition  messrs 
simonian  akilian and weinzierl are members of our board of directors and have significant influence in directing the actions taken by our board 
our business and reputation could suffer if we do not prevent security breaches 
we have included security features in some of our products that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of customer data 
despite the existence of these security features  our products may be vulnerable to breaches in security due to unknown defects in the security mechanisms  as well as vulnerabilities inherent in the operating system or hardware platform on which the product runs and or the networks linked to that platform 
security vulnerabilities  regardless of origin  could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the computer systems of our customers 
any security problem may require significant capital expenditures to solve and could materially harm our reputation and product acceptance 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable 
for example  we have a classified board of directors with three year terms  our stockholders are unable to take action by written consent and our stockholders are limited in their ability to make proposals at stockholder meetings 
volatility in our stock price could result in claims against us 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as variations in our results of operations  changes in our business strategy  future sales of common stock  the announcement of technological innovations or new products by us  our competitors and others  market analysts estimates of our performance  general market and economic conditions  and equity market conditions and industry specific equity market trends 
the public markets have experienced significant volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of securities of many technology and telecommunications companies for reasons that have often been unrelated to financial results 
this volatility has and may continue to materially harm the market price of our common stock as well as our visibility and credibility in our markets 
additionally  in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its common stock 
we may be the target of similar litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to immaterial levels of market risk 
although revenues from customers located outside of the us represented of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in  to date  less than of international revenues have been denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  we have not been significantly exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we expect that in future periods a greater portion of international revenues may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars  thereby increasing our exposure to exchange rate gains and losses on non us currency transactions 
our international business is subject to the typical risks of any international business  including  but not limited to  the risks described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors 
accordingly  our future results could be materially harmed by changes in these or other factors 
currently  our cash is solely invested in money market funds denominated in us dollars 
we account for these investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these cash equivalents are treated as available for sale under sfas the carrying value of these cash equivalents approximates fair market value 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk  the risk that our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates 
if interest rates were to change by basis points  our investment income would be impacted by approximately million
