item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations when used in this discussion  the words expects  anticipates  believes and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect management s current intentions and expectations 
however  actual events and results could vary significantly based on a variety of factors including  and not limited to the abilities of manufacturing subcontractors to make adequate and timely deliveries  access to advanced production process technologies from manufacturing subcontractors  recruiting and retaining employees including those with engineering expertise in new disciplines 
in particular  the company s new product development efforts and customer engagements in system on chip integration represents a new endeavor and consequently carry greater risk of successful and timely execution 
these factors along with those set forth below under factors that may affect results  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein  to reflect any changes in the company s expectations with regard thereto or any changes in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 
note for a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and some of the risks that could affect future results  see risks that could affect future results 
this section should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates neomagic s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  doubtful accounts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenue and expenses and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements goodwill and other purchased intangible assets neomagic has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet  including goodwill and other purchased intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the impairment testing of goodwill and other purchased intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions as it pertains to the estimation of future cash flows for these assets 
the company s assets are tested and reviewed for indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis 
changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations 
if facts and circumstances indicate that the goodwill  other intangible assets or property and equipment may be impaired  an evaluation of continuing value would be performed 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets would be compared to their carrying amount to determine if a write down to fair value or discounted cash flow value is required 
estimation of inventory valuations the company s inventory valuation policy stipulates that at the end of each reporting period we write down or write off our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
the amount of the write down or write off is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value of the inventory based upon reasonable assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or write offs may be required 
additionally  as we introduce product enhancements and new products  and improve our manufacturing processes  demand for our existing products in inventory may decrease 
in the first quarter of fiscal  consistent with this policy  we recorded a charge of million for excess and obsolete write downs related to restructuring the business 
in the future  we may find that similar assessments may warrant another write down or write off of inventory 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the products are shipped to the customer  title has transferred  and no significant obligations remain 
in addition  the company requires the following i execution of a written customer order  ii delivery of the product  iii fee is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility of the proceeds is probable 
the company s shipment terms are typically fob shipping point 
with respect to products shipped to distributors  the company generally defers recognition of product revenue until the distributors sell its products to their customers 
on occasion  however  the company will sell products with end of life status to its distributors under special arrangements without any price protection or return privileges for which the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of title  typically upon shipment 
at the end of each accounting period  the company makes a determination of certain factors including sales returns and allowances  which could affect the amount of revenue recorded for the period 
sales returns provisions include considerations for known but unprocessed sales returns and estimation for unknown returns based on historical experiences 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
based on the uncertainty of future pre tax income  the company has presently fully reserved its deferred tax assets 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the company has also provided for certain potential tax liabilities 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
overview neomagic designs  develops and markets high performance semiconductor solutions for sale to original equipment manufacturers oems of handheld internet appliances 
previously  the company provided semiconductor solutions for the notebook pc multimedia accelerator marketplace 
in april  the company announced its intention to exit this market and is now focused on the market for handheld internet appliances 
the company has only recently begun to generate revenues from this new product effort 
there can be no guarantee that the company will be successful in the continued development  production and commercialization of this new product direction 
the majority of the company s net sales to date were derived from sales of its multimedia accelerator products 
the company may experience minimal sales of these products in fiscal the company expects to see an increase in revenues from its new product efforts in the handheld internet appliance market place in fiscal the company generally recognizes revenue upon title passage for product sales directly to customers 
the company s policy is to defer recognition of revenue of shipments to distributors until the distributors sell the product 
historically  a majority of the company s sales have been to a limited number of customers 
the company expects that a substantial portion of sales of its new products will also be to a limited number of customers 
the customers contributing significant amounts of net sales have varied and will continue to vary depending on the timing and success of new product introductions by the company and its customers 
on april  the company announced a change in strategy ceasing further development efforts of its existing notebook multimedia product line  and focusing future development efforts on technologies and products to enable multimedia communications 
as a result  the company undertook a significant resizing of its operations  and reduced its workforce by approximately in the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal included in this total are employees of the company s dvd product line  which was sold to lsi logic corporation in a transaction announced on april  in march  the company reduced its workforce in the us by and in israel by to be more in line with its plans for fiscal year in april  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement  the company sold the principal assets of the dvd product group to lsi logic buyer

the company had recorded million as a receivable shown in other current assets and deferred revenue  in fiscal the company recorded the additional million as a receivable shown in other current assets and deferred revenue as of january  on the consolidated balance sheet 
the gain will be recorded in the first quarter of  during the period in which the claim was settled and the cash was received 
in january the company extended its wafer supply agreement with infineon technologies ag of germany through fiscal to ensure future wafer supply for the company s new product efforts 
under the terms of the agreement  production for neomagic will make use of infineon s micron and micron embedded dram edram process technologies 
the agreement also provides for access to additional capacity and to more advanced process technologies to be developed by infineon 
there is no assurance that infineon and its partners will be able to continue developing advanced edram process technologies that will be adequate for the company s needs 
due to uncertainties over infineon s continued edram product development  the company is not using infineon s edram technology in products being introduced in neomagic has provided million in guarantees towards its wafer purchases over the term of the agreement 
infineon and the company are discussing potential amendments to the terms of the wafer purchase guarantee  but no decisions have been reached 
if orders from neomagic s customers do not meet the company s expectations  the company may incur a charge associated with its wafer purchase guarantee 
in march  the company reduced its workforce in the us by and in israel by to be more in line with its plans for fiscal year the company accrued severance charges of million associated with the reduction in workforce during the first quarter of fiscal and made cash payments of million in connection with this restructuring activity 
during the second quarter of fiscal the company completed the restructuring activity by making additional cash payments of million of which million was charged against the accrual and million was expensed 
on december  the company completed its acquisition of certain assets  customer contracts  and intellectual properties of linkup systems corporation linkup of santa clara  california  in exchange for  shares of neomagic common stock 
the average closing stock price from the period of december through december was approximately 
this transaction did not have a material effect on the company s cash or cash equivalents for the fiscal year 
neomagic has hired most of the employees of linkup 
the transaction was accounted for under the purchase method 
linkup was a small privately held firm that had developed a family of system on chip semiconductor products using risc cpu cores licensed from arm ltd 
for similar market opportunities to those that the company has been pursuing 
all product and market related activities of the two companies have now been merged 
neomagic intends to support current linkup products and customers and  through this acquisition  to accelerate the development of new soc solutions with low power  high performance multimedia communication capabilities 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced design wins in three of its target market segments  including communication devices such as cellular phones  entertainment devices such as handheld games and media players  and productivity devices such as pdas and webpads 
the company now has a product line which includes three arm based soc s  as well as two peripherals to strongarm or other processors 
going forward the company expects to ship more than a quarter million dollars of its new products in the first quarter of fiscal  and expects to see growth in each successive quarter for the rest of the year 
while the company expects a net loss for the next fiscal year as a whole  it is managing its spending prudently and expects to end the fiscal year with more than million in cash and equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash 
the company s fiscal year end is january any references herein to a fiscal year refer to the year ended january of such year 
results of operations net sales the company s net sales to date have primarily been generated from the sale of its multimedia accelerators 
the company s historical products were used in the personal computer industry with sales primarily in asia  japan  and the united states 
net sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the substantial decrease in sales from fiscal to fiscal is due to the company ending its notebook multimedia product line and beginning to focus development efforts on developing integrated system on chip semiconductor products for the handheld internet appliance marketplace 
the sales in fiscal year were primarily comprised of residual orders for the company s legacy multimedia accelerator products 
the company expects that the percentage of its net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period when new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their product life cycles 
the company expects that net sales  for fiscal will increase from fiscal due to its product introductions in the handheld internet appliance marketplace 
sales to customers located outside the united states including sales to the foreign operations of customers with headquarters in the united states  and foreign system manufacturers that sell to united states based oems accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales  although there can be no assurance that export sales as a percentage of net sales will remain at current levels 
all sales transactions were denominated in united states dollars 
two customers accounted for and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal four customers accounted for    and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal five customers accounted for    and respectively  of net sales in fiscal the company expects a significant portion of its future sales to remain concentrated with a limited number of strategic customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its strategic customers 
in addition  sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the occurrence of any such events or the loss of a strategic customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and the timing of the company s new product introduction 
gross margin gross margin was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
cost of sales includes amortization of deferred compensation of   and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
the company had minimal sales of its fully reserved legacy notebook products in fiscal the gross margin percentage decreased to of net sales in fiscal from of net sales in fiscal primarily due to excess and obsolete write downs of million  a lower of cost or market adjustment of million  and cancellation penalties to our manufacturing partners of million related to restructuring the business in the first quarter of fiscal in the future  the company s gross margin percentages may be affected by increased competition and related decreases in unit average selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  changes in the mix of products sold  timing of volume shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  and manufacturing yields particularly on new products 
the company has exited the notebook pc multimedia accelerator marketplace and has begun to introduce products for the handheld internet appliance marketplace 
revenues from these new products are expected to be limited in fiscal and gross margins are expected to be lower than for the notebook products initially until volume production is reached 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include compensation and associated costs relating to development personnel  operating system software costs and prototyping costs  which are comprised of photomask costs and pre production wafer costs 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenses include amortization of deferred compensation of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company has made  and intends to continue to make  significant investments in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced products to serve its identified markets 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal primarily relates to lower labor costs due to lower average headcount offset somewhat by higher photomask costs associated with the company s new product development effort in the handheld internet appliance market 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal due to a reduction in the number of employees and an overall effort to reduce expenses 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal due to development efforts on the company s new product effort in the area of handheld internet appliances 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
these expenses include amortization of deferred compensation of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to lower outside commissions on lower sales  and the company s ongoing cost reduction efforts offset in part by million of employee related severance expenses incurred in the first quarter of fiscal in connection with restructuring the business 
sales  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as sales of the company s new products increase 
acquired in process research and development the company incurred approximately million of charges for acquired in process research and development iprd in connection with its december acquisition of linkup 
as of the date of acquisition  iprd has no alternative future use and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
the amount allocated to the acquired in process research and development was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from each of the technologies under development to their net present value  at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
linkup s development efforts were in the l silicon product that will use the next generation arm technology 
linkup s development efforts were estimated to be approximately complete at the date of the acquisition 
the estimated cost to complete the development effort of the l product is expected to be approximately  the project is expected to be completed at the end of fiscal revenue from a commercially viable product from this development effort was not anticipated until fiscal income  net of expenses  from the sale of dvd assets in april  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement  the company sold the principal assets of the dvd product group to lsi logic buyer 
the assets primarily consisted of fixed assets and intangible assets

during the third quarter of fiscal the company received a million cash payment which was previously contingent on the company s performance of certain obligations related to the transfer of licenses with third parties to the buyer 
as a result  the company recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million on the sale  which is recorded in income  net of expenses  from the sale of dvd assets on the consolidated condensed statements of operations 
in the first quarter of fiscal the company received a million cash payment previously contingent on the transfer of licenses with third parties to the buyer 
the company had recorded million as a receivable shown in other current assets and deferred revenue  in fiscal the company recorded the additional million as a receivable shown in other current assets and deferred revenue as of january  on the consolidated balance sheet 
the gain will be recorded in the first quarter of  during the period in which the claim was settled and the cash was received 
interest and other income the company earns interest on its cash and short term investments 
interest and other income was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to lower interest income earned on lower average cash balances and from significant interest rate reductions that occurred in fiscal the increase in fiscal stemmed from higher interest income earned on higher cash and short term investment balances 
interest expense in the past the company paid interest and bank commissions on wafer purchases and interest on its capital leases 
interest expense was thousand  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal is due to the significant reduction of capital lease balances 
the decrease in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal reflects lower interest and bank commissions on reduced purchases and lower capital lease balances 
income taxes the company s effective tax benefit rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal year  the tax benefit rate differed from the statutory rate due to an increase in the company s valuation allowance 
the benefit recorded was limited to current cash income tax refunds available 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets  which are currently fully reserved  depends on the company generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of such realization  management concluded that a full valuation allowance was required in liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  million  and million as of the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in fiscal stems primarily from cash used in operating activities which includes the company s deposit of million to establish an irrevocable standby letter of credit in accordance with the extension of its wafer supply agreement with infineon and a net loss of million 
the million deposit to establish the letter of credit is being shown on the company s consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash while the letter of credit remains in place 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in fiscal stems primarily from cash from investing activities and from cash provided by operating activities 
cash from investing activities includes million in proceeds from the sale of the dvd product group offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
cash and cash equivalents used by operating activities was million in fiscal while cash and cash equivalents provided from operating activities were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the cash used in operating activities stems primarily from the company s deposit of million to establish an irrevocable standby letter of credit in accordance with the extension of its wafer supply agreement with infineon  a net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable and in compensation and related benefits  an increase in other current assets  partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable and in non cash depreciation and deferred compensation amortization charges 
the cash provided from operating activities in fiscal stems primarily from decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  offset in part by the net loss of million and decreases in accounts payable and income taxes payable 
the cash provided from operating activities in fiscal stems primarily from million in net income and a decrease in inventory  offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  while net cash used for investing activities in fiscal was million 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to net maturities of short term investments partially offset by purchases of property  plant  and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to net proceeds received on the sale of the dvd product group of million and net maturities of short term investments of million  partially offset by purchases of property  plant  and equipment 
net cash used for investing activities in fiscal related primarily to cash paid of million for two acquisitions  million of net purchases of short term investments and million of investments in property  plant and equipment 
continued operation of the company s business may require higher levels of capital equipment purchases  technology investments  foundry investments and other payments to secure manufacturing capacity 
the timing and amount of future investments will depend primarily on the level of the company s future revenues 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily represents net proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily represents net proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by payments on capital lease obligations

at january   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
the company believes that it will not generate cash from operating activities over the upcoming twelve months  yet believes the current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months 
investments will continue in the company s new product development efforts in the handheld internet appliance marketplace 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of net sales  the timing and extent of spending to support research and development programs  the timing of any new product introductions  and market acceptance of the company s products 
the company expects that it may need to raise additional equity or debt financing in the future 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
in january the company signed an extension of its wafer supply agreement with infineon technologies 
in connection with that agreement  the company has agreed to purchase fifty thousand wafers before february  to secure this agreement  the company opened an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of million in february the company has secured the letter of credit with a million deposit at the issuing bank

recent tax legislative changes that occurred subsequent to year end will enable the company to extend its tax loss carry back period 
the change will enable the company to apply recent tax losses to additional previous years of profitability  which would result in additional tax refunds to the company 
the company is in the process of evaluating the amount of additional refunds it will be entitled to under the new tax legislation 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board issued fas no

the provisions of fas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the effect of adopting fas no 
has been evaluated by the company  and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  statement prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives

intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
additionally  statement requires that goodwill included in the carrying value of equity method investments no longer be amortized 
the company will apply statement beginning in the first quarter of application of the non amortization provisions of statement will reduce amortization expense in fiscal the company will reclassify certain intangible assets  as prescribed by statement  to goodwill at the date of adoption 
the company will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in statement the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the company expects to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of february  in the first quarter of any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas  as amended by sfas  establishes methods for recording derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments  as well as other hedging activities 
as required  the company adopted sfas effective february  because neomagic does not currently hold any derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities the adoption of sfas  as amended by sfas  did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
the company adopted sab in fiscal  and it did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
impact of currency exchange rates in the past  the company has purchased wafers under contracts denominated in yen 
significant appreciation in the value of the yen relative to the value of the us dollar would make the wafers relatively more expensive to the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has in the past and may in the future enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize short term foreign currency fluctuation exposures related to these firm purchase commitments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s accounting policies for these instruments are based on the company s designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 
the criteria the company uses for designating an instrument as a hedge include its effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
notwithstanding the measures the company has adopted  due to the unpredictability and volatility of currency exchange rates and currency controls  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience currency losses in the future  nor can the company predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
in fiscal all the company s payments to us suppliers were denominated in us dollars 
the company did not experience fluctuations during fiscal that negatively impacted the company s gross margin and results of operations due to limited foreign exchange activity during the year  as a result of the company exiting the notebook product market 
factors that may affect results our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate the company s quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a variety of factors that could materially adversely affect net sales  gross margin and operating results 
these factors include  among others  the abilities of manufacturing subcontractors to make adequate and timely deliveries  access to advanced production process technologies from manufacturing subcontractors  recruiting and retaining employees including those with engineering expertise in new disciplines 
in particular  the company s new product development efforts and customer engagements in system on chip integration and supporting multimedia technologies such as mpeg streaming video represent new endeavors and consequently carry greater risks of successful and timely execution 
any one or more of these factors could result in the company failing to achieve its expectations as to future revenues and profits 
the company may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall  which could materially adversely affect quarterly operating results 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
in future quarters  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
since the company s announcement of its restructuring in april of  and of its expectation of declining revenues  gross margins and operating results  the market price of the common stock has been and is expected to be for some time in the future  materially adversely affected 
we have a limited customer base the company s sales were historically concentrated within a limited customer base in the notebook pc market 
the company has now exited the notebook pc market and is currently beginning to generate revenues from products for the handheld internet appliance market 
the company expects to have commitments from only a limited number of customers during fiscal the company expects that a small number of customers will account for a substantial portion of its net sales for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  the majority of the company s sales were historically made  and are expected to continue to be made  on the basis of purchase orders rather than pursuant to long term purchase agreements 
as a result  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the decision of a single customer to cease using the company s products  or by a decline in the number of handheld internet appliances sold by a single customer 
we may lose our customer base the company s products are designed to afford the handheld internet appliance manufacturer significant advantages with respect to product performance  power consumption and size 
to the extent that other future developments in components or subassemblies incorporate one or more of the advantages offered by the company s products  the market demand for the company s products may be negatively impacted 
we face intense competition in our markets the market for semiconductor solutions for handheld internet appliances  in which the company is now focused  is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
neomagic believes that the principal factors of competition in this market are performance  price  features  power consumption  size and software support 
the ability of the company to compete successfully in this new rapidly evolving handheld appliance market depends on a number of factors including  success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies  product quality and reliability  price  the efficiency of production  ramp up of production of the company s products for particular system manufacturers  end user acceptance of the system manufacturers products  market acceptance of competitors products and general economic conditions 
neomagic competes with major domestic and international companies  some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
the company s principal competitors include intel s strongarm and xscale product lines  texas instruments omap product line  and a number of vertically integrated electronics firms who are developing their own solutions 
neomagic may also face increased competition from new entrants into the handheld internet appliance semiconductor market including companies currently at developmental stages 
certain of the company s competitors may offer products with more functionality and or higher processor speeds at the expense of battery life and power consumption than the company s product offerings 
the company s product developments may continue to utilize embedded dram technologies to produce system on chip technology for a portion of future product efforts 
neomagic has significant intellectual properties and historically demonstrated expertise in this technology 
however  the company is now also exploring alternative technologies such as multi chip module mcm solutions and other packaging related approaches to combining multiple chips 
the successful commercial introduction by competitors of products that integrate dram with analog and logic circuitry on a single chip  or the inability of the company to produce products for their new market  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
some of the company s current and potential competitors operate their own manufacturing facilities 
since the company does not operate its own manufacturing facility and may from time to time make binding commitments to purchase products  it may not be able to reduce its costs and cycle time or adjust its production to meet changing demand as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
our products may be incompatible with evolving industry standards and market trends the company s ability to compete in the future will also depend on its ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards and market trends 
unanticipated changes in market trends and industry standards could render the company s products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers 
as a result  the company could be required to invest significant time and resources to redesign its products or obtain license rights to technologies owned by third parties in order to ensure compliance with relevant industry standards and market trends 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to redesign its products or obtain the necessary third party licenses within the appropriate window of market demand 
if the company s products are not in compliance with prevailing market trends and industry standards for a significant period of time  the company could miss crucial oem design cycles  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on new product development to meet rapid market and technological change the company is now focused on providing high performance semiconductor solutions for sale to original equipment manufacturers of handheld internet appliances 
new product planning is primarily focused on integrated system on chip semiconductor products for handheld internet appliances  and multimedia technologies for integration into such products  such as mpeg video compression  image processing  graphics  and audio technologies 
the company s future business  financial condition and results of operations will depend to a significant extent on its ability to develop new products that address these market opportunities 
as a result  the company believes that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future 
the markets for handheld internet appliances are emerging opportunities  characterized by rapidly changing infrastructure  evolving industry standards and uncertain average selling prices 
the company must anticipate the features and functionality that consumers and infrastructure providers will demand  incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the exacting design requirements of equipment manufacturers  price its products competitively and introduce the products to the market on a timely basis 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on several factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  the ability to create or acquire intellectual property  the ability of strategic manufacturing partners to effectively design and implement the manufacture of new products  quality of new products  differentiation of new products from those of the company s competitors and market acceptance of the company s and its customers products 
there can be no assurance that the products the company expects to introduce will incorporate the features and functionality demanded by system manufacturers and consumers  will be successfully developed  or will be introduced within the appropriate window of market demand  nor can there be assurance that customers who utilize the company s semiconductor products will achieve the levels of market success with their own system products that they may project to the company 
because of the complexity of its products  the company has experienced delays from time to time in completing development and introduction of new products 
in addition  the company is now beginning production and continuing the development of new products in markets in which the company has little history 
in the event that there are delays in ramping production of current products  or in the completion of development of future products  including the products currently under development for introduction over the next to months  the company s potential future business  financial condition  and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the time required for competitors to develop and introduce competing products may be shorter  manufacturing yields may be better  and production costs may be lower than those experienced by the company 
the company has exited the notebook pc market and has only recently begun generating minor levels of revenues from its handheld internet appliance products 
while revenues are expected to grow  the low initial levels of revenues at the beginning of the year will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in fiscal we depend on third party manufacturers to produce our products the company s products require wafers manufactured with state of the art fabrication equipment and techniques 
the company currently utilizes several foundries for wafer fabrication 
the company has also signed an extended wafer supply agreement with infineon technologies ag of germany to manufacture the company s wafers 
the company expects that  for the foreseeable future  some of its products will be manufactured by a single source 
since  in the company s experience  the lead time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new wafer fabrication partner is at least months  and the estimated time for a foundry to switch to a new product line ranges from four to nine months  there may be no readily available alternative source of supply for specific products 
a manufacturing disruption experienced by the company s manufacturing partners  the failure of the company s manufacturing partners to dedicate adequate resources to the production of the company s products  or the financial instability of the company s manufacturing partners would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  in the event that the transition to the next generation of manufacturing technologies by the company s manufacturing partner is unsuccessful  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
there are many other risks associated with the company s dependence upon third party manufacturers  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality  manufacturing yields and cost  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  limited warranties on wafers supplied to the company  and potential misappropriation of neomagic s intellectual property 
the company is dependent on its manufacturing partners to produce wafers with acceptable quality and manufacturing yields  deliver those wafers on a timely basis to the company s third party assembly subcontractors and to allocate to the company a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet the company s needs 
although the company s products are designed using the process design rules of the particular manufacturer  there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturing partners will be able to achieve or maintain acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturing partners will continue to devote adequate resources to the production of the company s products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of the company s products are based 
we rely on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products the company s notebook multimedia products have been assembled and tested by third party subcontractors as are the company s new products for the handheld internet appliance marketplace 
the company does not have long term agreements with any of these subcontractors 
such assembly and testing is conducted on a purchase order basis 
as a result of its reliance on third party subcontractors to assemble and test its products  the company cannot directly control product delivery schedules  which could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase the costs of manufacturing or assembly of the company s products 
due to the amount of time normally required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors  product shipments could be delayed significantly if the company were required to find alternative subcontractors 
any problems associated with the delivery  quality or cost of the assembly and test of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may encounter inventory excess or shortage the company has wafer supply relationships with several foundries to support the company s product efforts 
normally  the company is obligated to provide rolling month forecasts of anticipated purchases and to place binding purchase orders three to four months prior to shipment 
the company orders wafers for deliveries at least months in advance and with the additional time to assemble and test wafers  the company can have orders for finished goods that will not be available for up to six months into the future 
if the company does not have sufficient demand for its products and cannot cancel its current and future commitments without material impact  the company may experience excess inventory  which will result in a write off affecting gross margin and results of operations 
if the company cancels a purchase order  it must pay cancellation penalties based on the status of work in process or the proximity of the cancellation to the delivery date 
forecasts of monthly purchases may not increase or decrease by more than a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast without the manufacturer s consent 
thus  the company must make forecasts and place purchase orders for wafers before it receives purchase orders from its own customers 
this limits the company s ability to react to fluctuations in demand for its products  which can be unexpected and dramatic  and from time to time will cause the company to have an excess or shortage of wafers for a particular product 
as a result of the long lead time for manufacturing wafers and the increase in just in time ordering by manufacturers  semiconductor companies such as the company from time to time must take charges for excess inventory 
the company did in fact incur such charges in fiscal of million 
significant write offs of excess inventory have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
conversely  failure to order sufficient wafers would cause the company to miss revenue opportunities and  if significant  could impact sales by the company s customers  which could adversely affect the company s customer relationships and thereby materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
at january   the company has no significant outstanding purchase orders for the delivery of inventory 
risks with infineon production guarantee in january the company extended its wafer supply agreement with infineon technologies ag of germany through fiscal to ensure future wafer supply for the company s new product efforts 
under the terms of the agreement  production for neomagic will make use of infineon s micron and micron embedded dram edram process technologies 
the agreement also provides for access to additional capacity and to more advanced process technologies to be developed by infineon 
there is no assurance that infineon and its partners will be able to continue developing advanced edram process technologies that will be adequate for the company s needs 
due to uncertainties over infineon s continued edram product development  the company is not using infineon s edram technology in products being introduced in neomagic has provided million in guarantees towards its wafer purchases over the term of the agreement 
infineon and the company are discussing potential amendments to the terms of the wafer purchase guarantee  but no decisions have been reached 
if orders from neomagic s customers do not meet the company s expectations  the company may incur a charge associated with its wafer purchase guarantee 
infineon has informed neomagic that it will be transferring its e dram development and production to another manufacturing facility in its cluster program 
the transfer of edram technologies is complex and entails numerous process risks 
our manufacturing yields may fluctuate the fabrication of semiconductors is an extremely complex process  which typically includes hundreds of process steps 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in masks used to print circuits on a wafer  utilization of equipment with variations and numerous other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to remedy 
as a result  semiconductor companies often experience problems in achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  which are represented by the number of good die as a proportion of the total number of die on any particular wafer 
the company purchases wafers  not die  and pays an agreed upon price for wafers meeting certain acceptance criteria 
accordingly  the company bears the risk of the yield of good die from wafers purchased meeting the acceptance criteria 
the company experienced such yield problems in fiscal  which materially adversely affected the company s net sales  gross margins and results of operations in fiscal and semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both product design  which is developed largely by the company  and process technology  which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer 
historically  the company has experienced lower yields on new products 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between the company and the manufacturer 
this risk is compounded by the offshore location of the company s manufacturers  increasing the effort and time required identifying  communicating and resolving manufacturing yield problems 
as the company s relationships with new manufacturing partners develop  yields could be adversely affected due to difficulties associated with adopting the company s technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of each manufacturer 
any significant decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in the company s per unit product cost and could force the company to allocate its available product supply among its customers  potentially adversely impacting customer relationships as well as revenues and gross margins 
there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturers will achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
integration risks associated with the acquisition of the assets of linkup systems corporation in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired the assets of linkup systems  a privately held semiconductor company that was pursuing a similar product and market strategy 
references to future product developments and market and sales expectations reflect the merged activities of neomagic and linkup systems 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully undertake the manufacturing  marketing and sales of linkup products in a timely and successful manner 
delays or interruptions in the ramp of production  inability to retain former linkup employees or to integrate them effectivley into the company s organization  or the loss of supplier or customer relationships as a result of the neomagic acquisition of linkup  could have a material adverse effect on operational results during fiscal year uncertainty and litigation risk associated with patents and protection of proprietary rights the company relies in part on patents to protect its intellectual property 
as of january  the company has been issued patents  each covering certain aspects of the design and architecture of the company s products 
additionally  the company has numerous patent applications pending 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications  or any future applications will be approved 
further  there can be no assurance that any issued patents will provide the company with significant intellectual property protection  competitive advantages  or will not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on the company s ability to do business 
in addition  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate the company s products or design around any patents that may be issued to the company 
the company also relies on a combination of mask work protection  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property 
despite these efforts  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets or intellectual property  or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets  or that the company can meaningfully protect its intellectual property 
a failure by the company to meaningfully protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a general matter  the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation  regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in december  the company filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware against trident microsystems  inc the suit alleges that trident s embedded dram graphics accelerators infringe certain patents held by the company 
in january  trident filed a counter claim against the company alleging an attempted monopolization in violation of antitrust laws  arising from neomagic s filing of the patent infringement action against trident 
the court has ruled that there is no infringement by trident 
management disagreed with this ruling and filed an appeal in the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
on april   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the lower court s judgment of non infringement on one patent and vacated the courts judgment of non infringement of another patent  thereby remanding it to the lower court for further proceedings 
management also believes the company has valid defenses against trident s claims 
there can be no assurance as to the results of the patent infringement suit and the counter suit for antitrust filed by trident 
any patent litigation  whether or not determined in the company s favor or settled by the company  would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel from productive tasks  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that current or future infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by other customers or end users of the company s products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such matter  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  which could include treble damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes  or to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance  however  that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any limitations on the company s ability to market its products  or delays and costs associated with redesigning its products or payments of license fees to third parties  or any failure by the company to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on international sales and suppliers export sales have been a critical part of the company s business 
sales to customers located outside the united states including sales to the foreign operations of customers with headquarters in the united states and foreign system manufacturers that sell to united states based oems accounted for  and of the company s net sales for fiscal   and  respectively 
the company expects that net sales derived from international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales 
letters of credit issued by customers have supported a portion of the company s international sales 
to date  the company s international sales have been denominated in united states dollars 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency of the company s customers could make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products sold in the customer s local currency 
international manufacturers have produced  and are expected to continue to produce for the foreseeable future  all of the company s wafers 
in addition  many of the assembly and test services used by the company are procured from international sources 
under the company s wafer supply agreement with infineon and under purchase orders with other manufacturing suppliers  the wafers are priced in us dollars 
international sales and manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences and export license requirements 
in addition  the company is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally including foreign government regulation  political and economic instability  and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  thus increasing the possibility of piracy of the company s products and intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these risks will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need additional capital the company requires substantial working capital to fund its business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements through the next months  although the company could be required  or could elect  to seek to raise additional capital during such period 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of net sales growth  timing and extent of spending to support research and development programs in new and existing areas of technology  expansion of sales and marketing support activities  and timing and customer acceptance of new products 
the company may raise additional equity or debt financing in the future 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we are dependent on qualified personnel the company s future success depends in part on the continued service of its key engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  finance and executive personnel  and its ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
the company has experienced the loss of certain key personnel and also reduced personnel in its restructuring 
if the company s headcount is not appropriate for its future direction and the company fails to recruit key personnel critical to its future direction in a timely manner  it may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience resource shortages in our future growth any continued growth in the company s sales or any continued expansion in the scope of our operations could strain our current management  financial  manufacturing and other resources and may require the company to implement and improve a variety of operating  financial and other systems  procedures and controls 
specifically the company has experienced strain in its financial and order management system  as a result of its acquisitions 
while the company plans to expand its sales  accounting  manufacturing  and other information systems to meet these challenges  there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed  or that any existing or new systems over time  procedures or controls will be adequate to support its operations or that its systems  procedures and controls will be designed  implemented or improved in a cost effective and timely manner 
any failure to implement  improve and expand such systems  procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner could harm the company s growth strategy and adversely affect its financial condition and ability to achieve its business objectives 
our stock price may be volatile the market price of the company s common stock  like that of other semiconductor companies  has been and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the market price of the company s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors  including quarter to quarter variations in the company s anticipated or actual operating results  announcements of new products  technological innovations or setbacks by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor and pc industries  unanticipated shifts in the handheld internet appliance market or industry standards  loss of key customers  changes in dram pricing  litigation commencement or developments  changes in or the failure by the company to meet estimates of the company s performance by securities analysts  market conditions for high technology stocks in general  and other events or factors 
in future quarters  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
since the company s decline in revenues  gross margins and operating results  the market price of the common stock has been and is expected to be for some time in the future  materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency fluctuations in the past  the company has purchased wafers in japanese yen  and has utilized foreign currency forward contracts and options to minimize short term foreign currency fluctuation exposures related to these purchases
