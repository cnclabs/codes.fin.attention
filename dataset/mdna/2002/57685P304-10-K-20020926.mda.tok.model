we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services through our offices in the united states  canada  england  france  germany  italy  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan and the netherlands and indirectly through our alliance partner network throughout europe and asia pacific 
revenues by geographic region fluctuate each period based on the timing and the size of transactions 
we expect revenues by geographic region to continue to fluctuate each period  and we expect revenues from our international operations to increase as we expand our international sales and professional services organizations 
no single customer accounted for more than of our annual revenues in fiscal or fiscal however  during fiscal  approximately of our revenues were from applied materials  inc as a result of unfavorable global economic conditions and a reduction in information technology spending around the world  in october we implemented a restructuring program to reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions 
the restructuring program included a reduction in the number of employees across all functions and locations  a reduction in the use of independent contractors across all functions and locations  termination of certain contracts  and closure of excess facilities 
we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology and products  recruit  hire and train personnel for our engineering  selling and marketing and services departments  and establish a corporate infrastructure 
these costs have historically exceeded total revenues 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate that our operating expenses in fiscal will exceed projected revenues 
accordingly  we expect to incur a net loss in fiscal in addition  if our operating expenses are higher than we anticipate or our revenues are lower than projected  we may incur significant net losses in fiscal and in the future 
matrixone was incorporated in july as adra systems  inc in october  we changed our name to matrixone  inc  and in may  we sold our legacy design and manufacturing software business  adra systems  to focus on our plm solutions 
the financial results of this divested business are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments  which we evaluate on an on going basis  that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services 
we execute separate contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each software license and maintenance arrangement and each professional services arrangement 
these contracts may be an element in a multiple element arrangement 
revenues under multiple element arrangements  which may include several different software products or services sold together  are allocated to each element using the residual method 
we use the residual method when fair value does not exist for one of the delivered elements in an arrangement 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized 
we have established sufficient vendor specific objective evidence for professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenue is recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services 
we recognize software license revenues upon execution of a signed license agreement  delivery of the software to a customer and determination that collection of a fixed license fee is probable 
for delivery over the internet  the software is considered to have been delivered upon confirmation by the customer of the file transfer 
since we have no obligation to an end user of a distributor  software license revenues from distributors are recognized upon delivery to the distributor 
we recognize revenue from software subscription arrangements ratably over the term of the contract on a straight line basis 
fees from revenue sharing  royalty and subscriber arrangements with and through third parties are recognized as revenue when they are fixed and determinable  generally upon receipt of a statement from the third party 
service revenues include professional services  training  maintenance and customer support fees and reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
professional services are not essential to the functionality of the other elements in an arrangement and are accounted for separately 
professional services revenues are primarily derived from time and material contracts and are recognized as the services are performed 
professional services revenues for fixed price contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
if conditions for acceptance are required  professional services revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
our customers generally reimburse us for the majority of our out of pocket expenses incurred during the course of a project 
we do not mark up or add additional fees to the actual out of pocket expenses we incur 
training revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
maintenance and customer support fees include the right to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis and ongoing technical support 
maintenance and customer support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  generally one year  on a straight line basis 
when a maintenance and customer support fee is included with a software license fee  we allocate a portion of the software license fee to maintenance and customer support fees based on the renewal rate of maintenance and customer support fees 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically assess the collectibility of customer accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from uncollectible customer accounts receivable 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current credit worthiness  customer concentrations  age of the receivable and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could materially differ from our estimates 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a materially different allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
prepaid software license fees prepaid software license fees  which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets  are paid to third party software developers under contractual arrangements for technology integrated into certain of our application and integration products 
amortization of prepaid license fees commences when the software is available for general release 
we amortize prepaid license fees to cost of software license revenues based on the greater of the actual royalties incurred to date or the straight line method of amortization over the estimated useful life of the software product  which is generally three years 
management regularly reviews the valuation of each prepaid software license fee in order to determine if events and circumstances may require a change in such valuation to reflect the estimated recoverable amount 
a reduction in the license or discontinuation of software for which we have prepaid license fees  may result in additional charges to cost of software license revenues 
property and equipment we estimate the useful lives of our property and equipment  and we record depreciation on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment 
we regularly review our estimate of the useful lives and net book value of our property and equipment in order to determine if events and circumstances  such as changes in technology  product obsolescence and changes in our business  may require a change in the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment  which would increase our operating expenses or recognition of an impairment loss 
accounting for income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the estimated amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
during our assessment of the valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies on a consolidated basis and in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset due to the fact it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we regularly evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and may adjust the valuation allowance based on such analysis 
professional services warranty we provide for an estimate of professional services warranty based on historical activity 
warranty expense is included in cost of services 
if actual warranty activities differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and result in additional charges to cost of services 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for each period indicated 
these historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period 
year ended june  june  july  revenues software license service total revenues cost of revenues software license service total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative stock based compensation restructuring charges total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations 
gain on sale of discontinued operations net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  software license revenues 
we derive our software license revenues principally from licensing our enterprise software including our ematrix product collaboration platform  value chain portfolio applications and interoperability products 
software license revenues decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the weakening of the global economy and a decrease in information technology spending 
in addition  new customers are starting new information technology projects with smaller initial software license investments 
accordingly  the average deal size of our software license transactions decreased and software licensed to new customers decreased during fiscal software license revenues decreased million in north america  million in europe and million in asia pacific due to the factors previously discussed 
service revenues 
we provide services to our customers and systems integrators consisting of professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services 
our professional services  which include implementation and consulting services  are primarily provided on a time and materials basis 
typically  our customers reimburse us for the majority of our out of pocket expenses incurred during the course of a project 
during fiscal  we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf relating to the accounting for reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred and reclassified such amounts in all previous period financial statements 
accordingly  our service revenues include reimbursements for out of pocket expenses incurred  which had been previously reported as a reduction to cost of services to offset the costs incurred 
we do not mark up or add additional fees to the actual out of pocket expenses we incur 
we also offer training services to our customers  distributors and systems integrators either in our offices throughout the world or at customer locations 
customers that license our products generally purchase annually renewable maintenance contracts  which provide customers with the right to receive unspecified software upgrades and technical support over the term of the contract 
service revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to an million increase in maintenance revenues from new and renewed maintenance contracts and a million increase in professional services revenues from implementation and consulting projects for new customers and continuation or expansion of implementation and consulting projects for existing customers 
during fiscal  there was also an increase in the average number of professional services employees providing billable implementation and consulting services and an increase in the billable utilization of our professional services personnel 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred were million for both fiscal and fiscal maintenance revenues represented and of service revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses primarily consists of royalties paid to third parties for certain application and integration products licensed to our customers 
cost of software licenses also includes the cost of manuals and product documentation  production media used to deliver our products and shipping costs 
our cost of software licenses fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of software licensed and the extent to which we pay royalties to third parties on application and integration products 
cost of software licenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in cost of software licenses was primarily due to a million decrease in royalties on integration software as a result of decreased licensing of third party integration software  offset by a million increase in royalties on application software as a result of increased licensing of third party application software and amortization of certain prepaid royalties 
cost of services 
cost of services includes salaries and related expenses for internal services personnel and costs of contracting with independent systems integrators to provide consulting services 
cost of services fluctuates based on the mix of internal professional services personnel and more expensive independent systems integrators used for professional services projects 
our gross margins may fluctuate based on the actual costs incurred to provide professional services 
cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to a million increase in internal services personnel costs due to an increase in the average number of services personnel employed during the year  a million increase in consulting and contractor costs due to an increase in the use of independent systems integrators  and an increase in rent  depreciation and other costs 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of total revenues  or gross margin  decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to a decrease in higher margin software license revenues and an increase in the relative proportion of our total revenues derived from lower margin service revenues 
gross margin on software licenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily due to an increase in the relative proportion of third party application software licensed  which are subject to royalties 
during fiscal  we adopted the provisions of eitf no 
relating to the accounting for reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
accordingly  our service revenues include reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which had been previously reported as a reduction to cost of services to offset the costs incurred 
this reclassification of out of pocket expenses incurred did not affect the amount of our gross profit but did decrease our gross margin 
gross margin on services increased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses include marketing costs  such as public relations and advertising  trade shows  marketing materials and customer user group meetings  and selling costs such as sales training events and commissions 
selling and marketing costs may fluctuate based on the timing of trade shows and user group events and the amount of sales commissions  which vary based upon revenues 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an million decrease in commission and other compensation expenses due to lower software license revenues  offset by a slight increase in personnel and related costs 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal due to a lower revenues base 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our intellectual property and are charged to expense as incurred 
to date  software development costs have been charged to expense as incurred because the costs incurred from the attainment of technological feasibility to general product release have not been significant 
research and development costs may fluctuate based on the utilization of domestic and foreign third party contractors  which are generally more expensive than our internal engineering personnel  and the use of third parties to develop specific application and integration products 
research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel  a million increase in outsourced translation services and an increase in rent  depreciation and other costs 
we have increased our research and development organization in order to further improve our existing products  bring additional products to market  such as additional value chain portfolio applications  and invest in our strategic relationship with ibm 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to the factors previously discussed and a lower revenues base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation of executive  finance  investor relations  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services  and provisions for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to a million increase in personnel and related costs  a million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts  due to increased credit risk as a result of the weakening global economy  and an increase in professional fees 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to the factors previously discussed and a lower revenues base 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation relates to the issuance of stock options to employees with exercise prices below the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in connection with certain stock option grants to employees during fiscal and  we recorded deferred stock based compensation totaling approximately million 
deferred stock based compensation represents the difference between the option exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of the option grant and is reported as deferred stock based consideration  a component of stockholders equity 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized through charges to operations over the vesting period of the options  which is generally four years 
stock based compensation was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense reflects lower amortization due to cancellation of stock options upon employee terminations 
we presently expect to record stock based compensation of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
restructuring charges 
as a result of unfavorable global economic conditions and a reduction in information technology spending around the world  in october we implemented a restructuring program to reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions 
the restructuring program included a reduction in the number of employees across all functions and locations  a reduction in the use of independent contractors across all functions and locations  termination of certain contracts and closure of excess facilities 
the restructuring program included a reduction in workforce of employees  consisting of employees in cost of service revenues  employees in selling and marketing  employees in research and development and employees in general and administration 
the costs related to the reduction in workforce include severance and fringe benefits 
in the restructuring program  we also terminated the services of independent contractors 
there were no incremental costs to us related to the termination of the services of these independent contractors 
the restructuring program also included facility and lease costs related to the closure of certain excess facilities and activities that we exited and the termination of certain automotive lease contracts 
as a result of the restructuring program  we canceled certain contracts related to terminated activities and programs that were either noncancelable or cancelable with penalty provisions 
the costs related to the negotiated termination of these contracts are included in the restructuring charge as contract terminations 
as a result of the restructuring program  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in october the restructuring charge consisted of costs related to the following statement of operations classifications million in cost of service revenues  million in selling and marketing  million in research and development and million in general and administrative 
during the three months ended june   we recorded a million adjustment to the restructuring charge as a result of the settlement of certain employee severance  lease and other contractual arrangements 
the significant components of the restructuring charge  non cash adjustments  cash payments and the remaining accrual at june  are as follows employee severance and facilities fringe and contract in millions benefits leases terminations total restructuring charges non cash adjustments adjusted restructuring charges cash payments remaining accrual at june  the restructuring program was substantially completed during fiscal the remaining cash payments are expected to be paid through january  other income expense 
other income expense fluctuates based on interest income earned on our investments and the amount of cash available for investment  interest expense related to borrowings under our credit facilities  realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and gains and losses on sales and disposals of fixed assets 
other income decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in other income was primarily due to a million decrease in interest income from lower yields on our investments resulting from a significant decrease in market interest rates and slightly lower levels of cash available for investment 
provision for income taxes 
no provision for income taxes was recorded for fiscal due to our accumulated net losses 
a provision for income taxes of million was recorded during fiscal based on our estimate of income taxes expected to be due in certain states and foreign countries 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and july  software license revenues 
software license revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due to revenues from new customers as well as additional software licensed to existing customers 
we introduced our value chain portfolio applications in the second quarter of fiscal and expanded our integration product offerings resulting in a increase in the licensing of our integration products 
software license revenues in north america and japan increased million and million  respectively  due to the factors previously discussed 
software license revenues in europe decreased approximately million due to a decrease in software licensed to both new and existing customers as a result of increased competition and a general weakening of the european economy 
service revenues 
service revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to a increase in maintenance revenues from new and renewed maintenance contracts  a increase in professional services revenues as a result of an increase in the number of professional services employees providing billable implementation and consulting services and a increase in training revenues from an increase in the number of customers and users utilizing our software 
maintenance revenues represented and of service revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in cost of software licenses was primarily due to a million increase in royalties resulting from increased licensing of third party integration software  offset by a million decrease in royalties for oracle database licenses 
cost of services 
cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to increased personnel costs to support the growth in our professional services organization 
we also increased both the use of systems integrators to provide consulting services for our customers and the amount of training we provided these systems integrators in an effort to increase the number of systems integrators with relevant ematrix expertise 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of total revenues  or gross margin  increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to higher margin software license revenues growing faster than services revenues 
gross margin on software licenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to a decrease in the relative proportion of software we licensed from third parties  primarily oracle database licenses 
gross margin on services increased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues and an increase in gross margin on professional services due to operational efficiencies 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to higher commission expense due to an increase in software license revenues  increased personnel costs related to the expansion of our worldwide sales and marketing organization and an increase in our marketing programs and events

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in personnel costs to support the growth in our business and provisions for doubtful accounts due to a larger revenues base 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in fiscal from for fiscal primarily due to a larger revenues base 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
other income expense  net 
other income  net increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher levels of cash available for investment as a result of the receipt of the proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock and concurrent private placement in march income taxes 
during fiscal  we provided for income taxes at an effective rate of approximately of income before income taxes 
this effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to certain nondeductible expenses and the change in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset 
no provision for income taxes was recorded in fiscal due to our accumulated net losses 
discontinued operations 
during fiscal  we settled a dispute relating to the may sale of adra systems  inc  our legacy design and manufacturing software business  and recognized a gain of million  representing the difference between the amount we originally accrued and the settlement amount 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had cash and equivalents of million  a decrease of million from june  our working capital was million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
the decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and equivalents due to our loss from operations and cash payments related to our restructuring program and a decrease in accounts receivable resulting from decreased revenues 
we have a million line of credit that bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus per annum on any outstanding balances and expires december  borrowings under this line of credit are limited to of eligible accounts receivable from customers in the united states 
as of june   we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit and million available 
this line of credit is collateralized by all of our assets and has financial and other covenants 
we were in compliance with these financial and other covenants as of june  net cash used in operating activities for fiscal was million resulting from our net loss and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  due to prepayment of software license fees  and a decrease in accrued expenses  offset by an increase in deferred maintenance revenues and a decrease in accounts receivable due to lower revenues 
net cash provided by continuing operations for fiscal was million resulting from our net income and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenues  offset by increases in accounts receivable due to higher revenues  and prepaid expenses and other current assets due to prepayment of software license fees 
the net cash used in discontinued operations in fiscal includes a payment of million to settle a dispute relating to the may sale of adra systems  inc  our legacy design and manufacturing software business 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal and reflects our investments in leasehold improvements  computer hardware and software and office furniture and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal and includes our investments in computer hardware  computer software and other technology  leasehold improvements and office equipment  and a million security deposit for our new corporate offices and customer success center  offset in part by the collection of notes receivable from stockholders 
we expect that capital expenditures for the next months will be approximately million  primarily for the acquisition of computer hardware  computer software and other technology 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and consisted of the proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
our principal source of liquidity is our current cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated from our operations 
our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent upon our ability to generate revenue from licensing our software and providing related services  as well as our ability to manage our operating costs 
a decrease in the demand for our software and related services or unanticipated increases in our operating costs would likely have an adverse effect on cash generated from operations 
during fiscal  our cash and equivalents decreased primarily due to our loss from operations and cash payments related to our restructuring program 
we currently expect to incur losses from operations for fiscal accordingly  we expect our liquidity to continue to decrease in fiscal we currently anticipate that our current cash and equivalents and available credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund a more rapid expansion of our business  develop new products  enhance existing products and services  or acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders may be reduced  our stockholders may experience additional dilution  and such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or develop or enhance our services or products would be significantly limited 
commitments and contractual obligations our commitments and contractual obligations primarily consist of operating leases for facilities  automobiles and office equipment and product development agreements under which we pay software license fees to third parties for development or assistance in development of certain application and integration software 
our commitments and contractual obligations consisted of the following as of june  fiscal commitment thereafter leases development agreements recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses the accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we will be required to adopt sfas no later than the fiscal year beginning on june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses the accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
we will be required to adopt sfas for any exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we are not required to restate any of the components of the restructuring charges recorded during fiscal as a result of the issuance of sfas income taxes as of june   we had net operating loss carryforwards in the united states of million  which include deductions of approximately million related to the exercise of stock options  and research and development tax credit carryforwards in the united states of million 
these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire in varying amounts commencing in fiscal through fiscal  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on an annual basis could be limited as a result of an ownership change as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
we have completed several financings and believe that we have incurred ownership changes  which we do not believe will have a material impact on our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
as of june   we also had net operating loss carryforwards in various countries in which our subsidiaries operate aggregating million  which include deductions of approximately million related to the exercise of stock options 
certain of these net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts commencing in fiscal through fiscal  if not utilized 
because of the uncertainty regarding our ability to use our united states and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards  we have provided a full valuation allowance on these and all other deferred tax assets as of june cautionary statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in the following cautionary statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
if any of the following risks were to occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would decline 
any forward looking statements should be considered in light of the factors discussed below 
we have a history of losses  expect to incur losses in the future and may not achieve or maintain profitability we have incurred substantial net losses in the past  and we expect to incur net losses in future periods 
for fiscal  we incurred a net loss of approximately million  and in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of approximately million 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we will need to generate significant increases in revenues to achieve and maintain profitability  and we may not be able to do so 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues  our business will be significantly and adversely affected 
although we implemented a restructuring program in october to better align our operations and cost structure with market conditions  this program may not be sufficient for us to achieve profitability in any future period 
even if we achieve profitability in the future on a quarterly or annual basis  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability 
failure to achieve profitability or achieve and sustain the level of profitability expected by investors and securities analysts may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the weak worldwide economic conditions and computer software market may result in decreased revenues and operating losses the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for computer software and services  particularly in the market segments in which we compete 
because our sales are primarily to major corporations  our business also depends on general economic and business conditions 
a softening of demand for computer software and services caused by the current weak global economy may result in decreased revenues and operating losses 
in this weak economy  we may not be able to effectively promote future growth in our software and services revenues  achieve the revenue levels expected by investors and securities analysts in any given period or achieve profitability 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price could decline our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict  have varied significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
we typically realize a significant percentage of our revenues for a fiscal quarter in the second half of the third month of the quarter 
accordingly  our quarterly results may be difficult or impossible to predict prior to the end of the quarter 
any inability to obtain sufficient orders or to fulfill shipments in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular quarter may cause the results for that quarter to fall short of our revenues targets 
any disruption in our ability to conduct our business which occurs  especially in the third month of a quarter as was the case in the first quarter of fiscal due to the events of september   will likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  we base our current and future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenues 
our expenses are largely fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly if our revenues fall short of our expectations 
accordingly  a revenues shortfall in a particular quarter would have an adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for many reasons  including  without limitation o changes in demand for our products and services  including seasonal differences  o changes in the mix of our software licensing and services revenues  o changes in the mix of domestic and international revenues  o variability in the mix of professional services performed by us and systems integrators  o the amount of royalty payments due to third parties on our application and integration software products  and o the amount of training we provide to systems integrators and alliance partners related to our products and their implementation 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results to forecast our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if a shortfall in revenues occurs  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict when or if sales will occur and therefore we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues our products have a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our operating results 
customers view the purchase of our software as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  customers generally evaluate our software products and determine their impact on existing infrastructure over a lengthy period of time 
our sales cycle has historically ranged from approximately one to nine months based on the customer s need to rapidly implement a solution and whether the customer is new or is extending an existing implementation 
the license of our software products may be subject to delays if the customer has lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes 
we may incur significant selling and marketing expenses during a customer s evaluation period  including the costs of developing a full proposal and completing a rapid proof of concept or custom demonstration  before the customer places an order with us 
customers may also initially purchase a limited number of licenses before expanding their implementations 
larger customers may purchase our software products as part of multiple simultaneous purchasing decisions  which may result in additional unplanned administrative processing and other delays in the recognition of our license revenues 
if revenues forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized or are delayed to another quarter  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues  which could significantly and adversely affect our operating results 
we may not achieve our anticipated revenues if large software and service orders expected in a quarter are not placed or are delayed although we license our software to numerous customers in any quarter  a single customer often represents more than of our quarterly revenues 
we expect that revenues from large orders will continue to account for a large percentage of our total revenues in future quarters 
a customer may determine to increase its number of licenses and expand its implementation of our software throughout its organization and to its customers  suppliers and other business partners only after a successful initial implementation 
therefore  the timing of these large orders is often unpredictable 
if any large order anticipated for a particular quarter is not realized  delayed to another quarter or significantly reduced  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues  which could significantly and adversely affect our operating results and prevent us from achieving the revenue levels expected by investors and securities analysts in any given period 
if our existing customers do not license additional software products from us  we may not achieve growth in our revenues our customers initial implementations of our software often include a limited number of licenses 
customers may subsequently add licenses as they expand the implementations of our products throughout their enterprises or add software applications designed for specific functions 
therefore  it is important that our customers are satisfied with their initial product implementations 
if we do not increase licenses to existing customers  we may not be able to achieve growth in our revenues 
our future success is uncertain because we have significantly changed our product line we shipped the first application within our value chain portfolio of applications in october  and we recently began to offer three targeted plm solutions 
our strategy is to develop new applications for use in product lifecycle management and to combine them with our ematrix product collaboration platform  matrixone aef and enterprise interoperability products to create plm solutions 
our new business focus and strategy may not be successful 
in addition  because we have only recently begun to focus our business on the development  license and marketing of our application software and plm solutions  we may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
we face the many challenges  risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies transitioning to a new product line and using a new business strategy in a rapidly evolving market 
if we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy  our operating results will suffer 
we may not achieve anticipated revenues if market acceptance of our software does not continue we believe that revenues from licenses of our software  together with revenues from related professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services  will account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future financial performance will depend on market acceptance of our software  including our application and integration products  and any upgrades or enhancements that we may make to our products in the future 
as a result  if our software does not achieve and maintain widespread market acceptance  we may not achieve anticipated revenues 
in addition  if our competitors release new products that are superior to our software  demand for our products may not accelerate and could decline 
if we are unable to increase the number and scope of our integration and application products or ship or implement any upgrades or enhancements to our products when planned  or if the introduction of upgrades or enhancements causes customers to defer orders for our existing products  we also may not achieve anticipated revenues 
the market for our plm software is newly emerging and rapidly changing and demand for plm software may not evolve and could decline the market for plm software is rapidly changing 
we cannot be certain that this market will continue to develop and grow or that companies will choose to use our products rather than attempting to develop alternative platforms and applications internally or through other sources 
if we fail to establish a significant base of customer references  our ability to market and license our products successfully may be reduced 
companies that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of sharing information during the design  manufacturing and supply process may be reluctant to adopt new technology or infrastructures that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems or methods 
we expect that we will continue to need to pursue intensive marketing and selling efforts to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products 
therefore  demand for and market acceptance of our software products is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
if we are not successful in developing new products and services that keep pace with technology  our operating results will suffer the market for our software is characterized by rapid technological advances  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 
accordingly  to realize our expectations regarding our operating results  we depend on our ability to o develop  in a timely manner  new software products and services that keep pace with developments in technology  o meet evolving customer requirements  and o enhance our current product and service offerings and deliver those products and services through appropriate distribution channels 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  either enhancements to our products or new products that respond to technological advances and satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer needs 
if we fail to introduce new products  our operating results will suffer 
in addition  if new industry standards emerge that we do not anticipate or adapt to  our software products could be rendered obsolete and our business could be materially harmed 
due to the weak global economy  our customers may experience financial difficulties and may represent a credit risk due to the weak global economy and the uncertainty relating to the prospects for near term global economic growth  some of our customers may experience financial difficulties and may represent a credit risk to us 
if our customers  especially those with limited operating histories and limited access to capital  experience financial difficulties or fail to experience commercial success  we may have difficulty collecting our accounts receivable 
we will not succeed unless we can compete in our markets the markets in which we offer our software and services are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
furthermore  we expect competition to intensify  given the newly emerging nature of the market for plm software and consolidation in the software industry in general 
we will not succeed if we cannot compete effectively in these markets 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer 
many of our actual or potential competitors have significant advantages over us  including  without limitation o larger and more established selling and marketing capabilities  o significantly greater financial and engineering personnel and other resources  o greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers  and o well established relationships with our existing and potential customers  systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners 
as a result  our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services than we can 
accordingly  we may not be able to maintain or expand our revenues if competition increases and we are unable to respond effectively 
as competition in the plm software market intensifies  new solutions will come to market 
our competitors may package their products in a manner that may discourage customers from licensing our software 
also  current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties or adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
consolidation in the industry also results in larger competitors that may have significant combined resources with which to compete against us 
increased competition could result in reductions in price and revenues  lower profit margins  loss of customers and loss of market share 
any one of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
our revenues could decline if we do not develop and maintain successful relationships with systems integrators and complementary technology vendors we pursue business alliances with systems integrators and complementary technology vendors to endorse our software  implement our software  provide customer support services  promote and resell products that integrate with our products and develop industry specific software products 
these alliances provide an opportunity to license our products to our alliance partners installed customer bases 
in many cases  these parties have established relationships with our existing and potential customers and can influence the decisions of these customers 
we rely upon these companies for recommendations of our products during the evaluation stage of the purchasing process  as well as for implementation and customer support services 
a number of our competitors have strong relationships with these systems integrators and complementary technology vendors who  as a result  may be more likely to recommend our competitors products and services 
in addition  some of our competitors have relationships with a greater number of these systems integrators and complementary technology vendors and  therefore  have access to a broader base of enterprise customers 
if we are unable to establish  maintain and strengthen these relationships  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the selling and marketing  implementation and support of our products 
our efforts may not be as effective as these systems integrators and complementary technology vendors  which could significantly harm our operating results 
our international operations and planned expansion expose us to business risks which could cause our operating results to suffer our operations outside north america accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
export sales from the united states accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
many of our customers have operations in numerous locations around the globe 
in order to attract  retain and service multi national customers  we have to maintain strong direct and indirect sales and support organizations in europe and asia pacific 
our ability to penetrate international markets may be impaired by resource constraints and our ability to hire qualified personnel in foreign countries 
we face a number of risks associated with conducting business internationally  which could negatively impact our operating results  including  without limitation o difficulties relating to the management  administration and staffing of a globally dispersed business  o longer sales cycles associated with educating foreign customers on the benefits of our products and services  o longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  o difficulties in providing customer support for our products in multiple time zones  o currency fluctuations and exchange rates  o limitations on repatriation of earnings of our foreign operations  o the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  o reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  o multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures  o negative tax consequences such as withholding taxes and employer payroll taxes  o language barriers  o the need to consider numerous international product characteristics  o different accounting practices  o import export duties and tariffs  quotas and controls  o complex and inflexible employment laws  o economic or political instability in some international markets  and o conflicting international business practices 
we believe that expansion of our international operations will be necessary for our future success 
therefore  a key aspect of our strategy is to continue to expand our presence in foreign markets 
we may not succeed in our efforts to enter new international markets and expand our international operations 
if we fail to do so  we may not be able to achieve growth in our revenues 
this international expansion may be more difficult or time consuming than we anticipate 
it is also costly to establish international facilities and operations and promote our products internationally 
thus  if revenues from international activities do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining foreign operations  our operating results will suffer 
future acquisitions may negatively affect our ongoing business operations and our operating results we may expand our operations or market presence by acquiring or investing in complementary businesses  products or technologies that complement our business  increase our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer opportunities for growth 
these transactions create risks such as o difficulty assimilating the operations  technology  products and personnel we acquire  o disruption of our ongoing business  o diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  o one time charges and expenses associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets  and o potential dilution to our stockholders 
our inability to address these risks could negatively impact our operating results 
moreover  any future acquisitions  even if successfully completed  may not generate any additional revenues or provide any benefit to our business 
we depend on licensed third party technology  the loss of which could result in increased costs of or delays in licensing our products we license technology from several companies on a non exclusive basis that is integrated into many of our products 
we also license certain application and integration products from third parties 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
this software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
some of the software we license from third parties would be difficult and time consuming to replace 
the loss of any of these technology licenses could result in delays in the licensing of our products until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
in addition  the effective implementation of our products may depend upon the successful operation of third party licensed products in conjunction with our products  and therefore any undetected errors in these licensed products may prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions or injure our reputation 
if systems integrators are not available or fail to perform adequately  our customers may suffer implementation delays and a lower quality of customer service  and we may incur increased expenses systems integrators often are retained by our customers to implement our products 
if experienced systems integrators are not available to implement our products  we will be required to provide these services internally  and we may not have sufficient resources to meet our customers implementation needs on a timely basis 
use of our professional services personnel to implement our products would also increase our expenses 
in addition  we cannot control the level and quality of service provided by our current and future implementation partners 
if these systems integrators do not perform to the satisfaction of our customers  our customers could become dissatisfied with our products  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we may not be able to increase revenues if we do not expand our sales and distribution channels we will need to expand our direct and indirect global sales operations in order to increase market awareness and acceptance of our software and generate increased revenues 
we market and license our products directly through our sales organization and indirectly through our global alliance partner and distributor network 
our ability to increase our global direct sales organization will depend on our ability to recruit  train and retain sales personnel with advanced sales skills and technical knowledge 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense in our industry 
in addition  it may take up to nine months for a new sales person to become fully productive 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  or if newly hired sales personnel fail to develop the necessary skills or reach productivity more slowly than anticipated  we may have difficulty licensing our products  and we may experience a shortfall in anticipated revenues 
in addition  we believe that our future success is dependent upon expansion of our indirect global distribution channel  which consists of our relationships with a variety of systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and distributors 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our current relationships or establish relationships with additional distribution partners on a timely basis  or at all 
our distribution partners may not devote adequate resources to promoting or selling our products and may not be successful 
in addition  we may also face potential conflicts between our direct sales force and third party reselling efforts 
any failure to expand our indirect global distribution channel or increase the productivity of this distribution channel could result in lower than anticipated revenues 
we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively  and if we are unable to retain key personnel  our ability to compete could be harmed our ability to implement our business strategy and our future success depends largely on the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering  sales  marketing and support personnel who have critical industry or customer experience and relationships 
none of our key personnel  other than mark f 
o connell  our president and chief executive officer  is bound by an employment agreement 
we do not have key man life insurance on any of our employees 
the loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of any of these key personnel could result in delays in product development  loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  our future performance depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified sales  engineering  marketing  services and managerial personnel  and there is intense competition for such personnel 
if we do not succeed in retaining our personnel or in attracting new employees  our business could suffer significantly 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital as needed in the future  our business may be adversely affected and the market price for our common stock could significantly decline we have been unable to fund our operations using cash generated from our business operations and have financed our operations principally through the sale of securities 
we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund the expansion of our operations  to enhance our products and services  or to acquire or invest in complementary products  services  businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on terms favorable to us  our business may be adversely affected and the market price for our common stock could significantly decline 
our products may contain defects that could harm our reputation  be costly to correct  delay revenues and expose us to litigation despite testing by us  our alliance partners and our customers  errors may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
we and our customers have from time to time discovered errors in our software products 
in the future  there may be additional errors and defects in our software 
if errors are discovered  we may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
errors and failures in our products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and damage to our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of our products 
in addition  we may need to make significant expenditures of capital resources in order to eliminate errors and failures 
since our products are used by customers for mission critical applications  errors  defects or other performance problems could also result in financial or other damages to our customers  who could assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that such provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure with respect to such claims 
a product liability claim  even if unsuccessful  would be costly and time consuming to defend and could harm our business 
our business may be adversely affected by securities class action litigation on april   a consolidated amended complaint was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the complaint  which supersedes five virtually identical complaints that had been filed from july  to september   names as defendants the company  two of our officers  and certain underwriters involved in our initial public offering of common stock ipo 
the complaint is allegedly brought on behalf of purchasers of our common stock during the period from february  to december  and asserts  among other things  that our ipo prospectus and registration statement violated federal securities laws because they contained material misrepresentations and or omissions regarding the conduct of our ipo underwriters in allocating shares in our ipo to the underwriters customers  and that the company and the two named officers engaged in fraudulent practices with respect to this underwriters conduct 
the action seeks damages  fees and costs associated with the litigation  and interest 
we understand that various plaintiffs have filed substantially similar lawsuits against over three hundred other publicly traded companies in connection with the underwriting of their initial public offerings 
we and our officers and directors believe that the allegations in the complaint are without merit and intend to contest them vigorously 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain and unpredictable  however  and there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate outcome of this pending lawsuit 
even if successfully defended  this lawsuit could result in significant expense to us and the diversion of our management and technical resources  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the price of its securities 
due to the volatility of our stock price  we may be the target of securities litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our name recognition efforts and ability to compete effectively currently  we rely on a combination of trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards  including trade secret protection to protect our intellectual property rights 
to protect our intellectual property rights in the future  we intend to rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards  including trade secret protection 
we also rely on restrictions on use  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees  affiliates  customers  alliance partners and others 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary information 
a third party could obtain our proprietary information or develop products or technology competitive with ours 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights 
we have registered some of our trademarks in the united states and abroad and have other trademark and patent applications pending or in preparation 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services to the same extent as in the united states 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm or even destroy our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively 
further  enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and may not prove successful 
we could incur substantial costs defending our intellectual property from claims of infringement the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright  patent and other intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to future litigation based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others or that our own intellectual property rights are invalid 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products overlaps 
claims of infringement could require us to reengineer or rename our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products 
licensing or royalty agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
even if successfully defended  claims of infringement could also result in significant expense to us and the diversion of our management and technical resources 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile which may lead to losses by stockholders the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past 
during fiscal  our stock price has fluctuated between a low bid price of per share and a high bid price of per share 
during fiscal  our stock price fluctuated between a low bid price of per share and a high bid price of per share 
we believe that the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future in response to a number of events and factors relating to our company  our competitors  the market for our products and services and the global economy  many of which are beyond our control  such as o variations in our quarterly operating results  o changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  o changes in market valuations of software companies  o announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  o loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant business transactions  o additions or departures of key personnel  o sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by existing shareholders  o sales of common stock or other securities by us in the future  and o news relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management 
these provisions include  without limitation o authorizing the issuance of undesignated preferred stock  o providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  o requiring super majority voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  o limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  o prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and o establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
certain provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have international offices in canada  england  france  germany  italy  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan and the netherlands 
at june  and june   approximately and  respectively  of our total assets were located at our international subsidiaries 
approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  were from our operations outside north america 
in addition  approximately  and of our expenses for fiscal  and  respectively  were from our operations outside the united states 
these subsidiaries transact business in both local and foreign currency 
therefore  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks and fluctuations in foreign currencies  along with economic and political instability in the foreign countries in which we operate  all of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we use forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk and variability in operating results due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of accounts receivable and accounts payable and intercompany accounts receivable and intercompany accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies held until such receivables are collected and payables are disbursed 
a forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
these forward contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign currency receivables or payables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date that approximate the value and expected settlement date  respectively  of the underlying transactions 
unrealized gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period  resulting from changes in the fair value of these contracts  are recognized in earnings in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying foreign denominated receivables or payables are recognized and generally offset 
gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in other income expense  net 
we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we only enter into forward contracts with highly rated financial institutions 
at june   we had two forward contracts outstanding  which are presented in the table below 
the notional exchange rate is quoted using market conventions where the currency is expressed in currency units per us dollar 
notional fair market maturity notional exchange value as of currency position date amount rate june  euro purchase   euro sell   we plan to increase our use of forward contracts and other instruments in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations from accounts receivable and accounts payable and intercompany accounts receivable and intercompany accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  and we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
also  as we continue to expand our operations outside of the united states  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could increase 
we deposit our cash in highly rated financial institutions in north america  europe and asia pacific 
we invest in diversified united states and international money market mutual funds and united states treasury and agency securities 
at june   we had million  million  million and million invested in the united states  canada  continental europe and england  respectively 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe we have minimal market risk 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk 
all of our investments have remaining maturities of three months or less 
if these short term assets were reinvested in a declining interest rate environment  we would experience an immediate negative impact on other income 
the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment 
since january   the united states federal reserve board  european central bank and bank of england have significantly decreased certain benchmark interest rates  which has led to a general decline in market interest rates 
this decline in market interest rates has resulted in a significant decrease in our interest income
