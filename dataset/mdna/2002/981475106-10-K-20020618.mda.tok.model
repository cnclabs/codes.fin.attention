table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  and with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
reportable segments we have two reportable operating businesses marine and aviation fuel services 
in our marine fuel services business  we market marine fuel and related management services to a broad base of international shipping companies and to the united states and foreign militaries 
services include credit terms  hour around the world service  fuel management services  and competitively priced fuel 
in our aviation fuel services business  we extend credit and provide around the world single supplier convenience  hour service  fuel management services  and competitively priced aviation fuel and other aviation related services to passenger  cargo and charter airlines  as well as to united states and foreign militaries 
we also offer flight plans and weather reports to our corporate customers 
performance measurement and resource allocation for the reportable operating segments are based on many factors 
two of our primary financial measures used are revenue and income from operations 
our marine fuel business accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  while our aviation fuel business accounted for the remaining 
for fiscal and  our marine fuel business accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue 
in fiscal  excluding corporate overhead  our marine fuel services and our aviation fuel services contributed and  respectively  of operating income 
for fiscal and  excluding corporate overhead  our marine fuel services contributed and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  deferred tax assets and liabilities  goodwill and identifiable intangible asset  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recorded in the period when the sale is made or as the services are performed 
we contract with unrelated third parties to provide the fuel and or deliver most services 
this causes delays in receiving the necessary information for invoicing to our customers 
accordingly  revenue may be recognized in a period subsequent to when the actual delivery of fuel or service was performed 
this policy does not result in reported results that are materially different than if the revenue were recognized in the period of actual delivery or performance 
accounts receivable and allowance for bad debts credit extension  monitoring and collection are performed by each of our business segments 
each segment has a credit committee 
the credit committees are responsible for approving credit limits above certain amounts  setting and maintaining credit standards  and ensuring the overall quality of the credit portfolio 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of our customer s credit information 
we extend credit on an unsecured basis to many of our customers 

table of contents we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowances can be either specific to a particular customer or general to all customers in each of our two business segments 
as of march  and  we had accounts and notes receivable of million and million  net of allowance for bad debts of and million  respectively 
the allowance for bad debts at march  and included a specific allowance of million for one aviation customer representing the entire accounts receivable balance for that customer 
also  as of march   we established additional specific allowances of thousand for two other customers 
our remaining allowance of million and million at march  and  respectively  are general for all other customers 
we believe the level of our allowance for bad debts is reasonable based on our experience and our analysis of the net realizable value of our trade receivables at march  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past since adverse changes in the marine and aviation industries  or changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers  could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
if credit losses exceed established allowances  our results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected 
for additional information on the credit risks inherent in our business  see risk factors in part i of this report 
goodwill  identifiable intangible assets and investment goodwill goodwill and investment goodwill represent our cost or investment in excess of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  of the acquired companies 
investment goodwill of million was included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at march  and the identifiable intangible asset for customer relations existing at the date of acquisition was recorded and is being amortized over its useful life of five years 
effective april   as permitted  we elected to early adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  and states that goodwill shall not be amortized prospectively 
accordingly  no goodwill amortization was recorded for fiscal in fiscal and  we recorded goodwill amortization of thousand  including investment goodwill amortization of thousand  and thousand  respectively 
for fiscal  we amortized thousand of our identifiable intangible asset 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill and will perform an annual impairment review thereafter 
we completed the initial step of the transitional goodwill impairment test as of april  during the second quarter of fiscal this step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
based on results of these comparisons  goodwill in each of our reporting units is not considered impaired 
income taxes our provision for income taxes was determined by taxable jurisdiction 
we file a consolidated us federal income tax return which includes all of our us companies 
our us companies file income tax returns in their respective countries of incorporation  as required 
we do not provide for us federal and state income taxes  and us withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our non us companies 
the distribution of these earnings would result in additional us federal and state income taxes to the extent they are not offset by foreign tax credits and non us withholding taxes 
it is our intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of our non us companies indefinitely and thereby postpone their remittance 
accordingly  no provision has been made for taxes that could result from the remittance of such earnings 
we provide for deferred income taxes on temporary differences arising from assets and liabilities whose bases are different for financial reporting and us federal  state and us income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that an income tax benefit will not be realized 
no valuation allowance was recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents results of operations profit from our marine fuel services business is determined primarily by the volume and commission rate of brokering business generated and by the volume and gross profit achieved on sales  as well as the overall level of operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that we are required to provision for potential bad debts 
profit from our aviation fuel services business is directly related to the volume and the gross profit achieved on sales  as well as the overall level of operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that we are required to provision for potential bad debts 
in april  february  april  and january  we acquired the operations of the bunkerfuels group of companies  norse bunker as  marine energy group of companies  and the oil shipping group of companies  respectively 
these acquisitions form part of our worldwide marine fuel marketing segment and were accounted for as purchases 
accordingly  the results of operations of these acquisitions were included with our results since their respective dates of acquisition 
in december  we entered into a joint venture agreement with signature flight support corporation through the acquisition of a equity interest in pafco 
under the equity method of accounting  we have recorded our share of the results of pafco since january  in february  we sold our oil recycling segment to earthcare company and we reported this segment as a discontinued operation as of december  in october  our aviation joint venture in ecuador ceased operations 
during the comparable fiscal versus fiscal  our profitability was favored by an increase in metric tons traded and brokered in marine  an improvement in the gross profit per gallon sold in aviation  a lower provision for bad debts for both marine and aviation  and lower corporate overhead expenses 
earnings were adversely affected by a decrease in the gross profit per metric ton traded in marine  a decline in aviation sales volume  and increases in salaries and other operating expenses 
in fiscal  our profitability benefited by an insurance settlement recovery of million related to a fiscal theft of product off the coast of nigeria  a gain on the sale of a leasehold property  and the early adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill effective april  the lower comparable corporate overhead was due to an executive severance charge in fiscal related to the termination of the employment agreement with our former chairman of the board 
also contributing to the variance was a non recurring credit in fiscal related to a partial recovery of a previously written down aviation joint venture investment 
the increase in marine volume is primarily due to our marine acquisitions in fiscal and  while our decline in aviation sales volume reflects management s decision to reduce our credit exposure and increase margins 
the decrease in aviation sales volume during fiscal is also related to lower demand resulting from the general slowdown in economic activity 
in marine  the decrease in the gross profit per metric ton traded is due to competitive pressures stemming from the weakened economic environment  and by our marine acquisitions which resulted in the addition of lower margin trading business 
the increase in salaries and operating expenses in fiscal relates to the recent marine segment acquisitions and various business initiatives 
we may experience decreases in future sales volume and margins as a result of weakness in the shipping industry  the continued deterioration in the economy  the continued conflicts in the middle east  asia and latin america  and the military actions in response to terrorist attacks of september th  as well as possible future terrorist activity 
in addition  since the sharp decline in world oil prices soon after september th  world oil prices have been very volatile in the last five months 
the volatility in world oil prices can adversely affect our customers business  and consequently our results of operations 
see risk factors  above 
fiscal compared to fiscal our revenue for fiscal was billion  a decrease of million  or  as compared to revenue of billion for fiscal our revenue decrease was primarily due to a decrease in world oil prices in fiscal  partially offset by increases in sales resulting from our fiscal and marine segment acquisitions 

table of contents our revenue during these periods was attributable to the following segments fiscal year ended march  in thousands marine fuel services aviation fuel services total our marine fuel services segment contributed million in revenue for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  over fiscal the decrease in revenue was due to an decline in the average price per metric ton sold  partially offset by a increase in the volume of metric tons sold 
the increase in marine sales volume is due  in part  to sales from our fiscal and acquisitions 
our aviation fuel services segment contributed million in revenue for fiscal this represented a decrease in revenue of million or  as compared to fiscal the decrease in revenue was due to a decrease in the volume of gallons sold and a decrease in the average price per gallon sold 
the decrease in aviation sales volume reflects management s decision to reduce its credit exposure and increase margins  which began in the third quarter of fiscal sales volume also decreased in fiscal because of a general slowdown in economic activity 
during the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal and thus far in the first quarter of fiscal  we have begun to experience increased volumes in aviation 
our gross profit of million in fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal our gross margin also increased from for fiscal to for fiscal our marine fueling segment achieved a gross margin for fiscal  as compared to a gross margin for fiscal this gross margin increase resulted from a drop in the average price per metric ton traded  which offset a lower gross profit per metric ton traded 
the narrower gross profit per metric ton traded was caused by competitive pressures  and by the fiscal and acquisitions which resulted in the addition of lower margin trading business 
by integrating the acquisitions into our existing global network  we expect to gain from synergies in purchasing and value added services  and thereby maximize the gross profit of our newly acquired companies 
our aviation fueling business achieved a gross margin for fiscal  as compared to achieved for fiscal this increase resulted from an overall increase in the gross profit per gallon sold and the decline in the average price per gallon sold 
the improvement in gross profit resulted from a revision in our pricing strategy in the third quarter of fiscal as well as the recovery of certain business taxes previously expensed and the favorable resolution of certain outstanding items with suppliers 
for fiscal  our operating expenses were million  a decrease of million or  as compared to fiscal this decrease resulted from a million reduction in the provision for bad debts  a million executive severance charge in fiscal related to the termination of the employment agreement with our former chairman of the board  and the early adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill effective april  partially offsetting these improvements were operating expenses of the newly acquired companies  staff additions  and various business initiatives implemented over the past year

the aviation fuel segment s income from operations was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to 
table of contents fiscal this improvement is due to a higher gross profit and a million lower provision for bad debts  partially offset by increased operating expenses related to staff additions and various business initiatives which were implemented over the past year 
corporate overhead costs not charged to the business segments totaled million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  as compared to fiscal the improvement in corporate overhead is due to the million executive severance charge in fiscal and lower consulting and telecommunications expenses  partially offset by staff additions and higher compensation 
during fiscal  we reported million in other income  net  compared to million for fiscal this decrease is mainly due to foreign exchange losses for fiscal as opposed to foreign exchange gains in fiscal  a thousand decrease in net interest income  and a thousand non recurring credit recorded in fiscal related to a partial recovery of a previously written down aviation joint venture investment 
largely offsetting these decreases were the equity in earnings of our pafco aviation joint venture  a gain on the sale of a leasehold property  and a million insurance settlement recovery related to a fiscal theft of product off the coast of nigeria 
for fiscal  our effective tax rate was  for an income tax provision of million  as compared to an effective tax rate of and an income tax provision of million for fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate reflects the non taxable insurance settlement recovery of million in fiscal related to a fiscal theft of product off the coast of nigeria 
net income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  an increase of million  as compared to million for fiscal diluted earnings per share on income from continuing operations was  an increase of  or  as compared to per diluted share for fiscal during fiscal  we recorded additional income taxes of thousand related to the gain on the sale of our oil recycling segment  and a thousand after tax write off against the assets we ultimately realized in connection with the discontinuance of our used oil recycling business 
accordingly  in fiscal  we incurred a net loss from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share 
no discontinued operations activities were recorded in fiscal including discontinued operations  net income for fiscal increased by million  or  as compared to fiscal diluted earnings per share increased by  or  as compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal our revenue for fiscal was billion  an increase of million or  as compared to revenue of billion for fiscal our revenue increase was primarily due to a substantial increase in world oil prices 
our revenue during these periods was attributable to the following segments fiscal year ended march  in thousands marine fuel services aviation fuel services total our marine fuel services segment contributed billion in revenue for fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the increase in revenue for our marine segment was related to and increases in the average price per metric ton sold and brokered  respectively

our aviation fuel services segment contributed million in revenue for fiscal this represented an increase in revenue of million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase in revenue results from a increase in the average price per gallon sold  partially offset by a decrease in the volume of gallons sold 
our gross profit of million for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal our gross margin decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal our marine fuel segment achieved a gross margin for fiscal  as compared to a gross margin for fiscal our marine segment increased its gross margin despite higher fuel prices  due to an increase in the average gross profit per metric ton sold and brokered  the result of better pricing 
table of contents and a reduction in low margin business activity 
our aviation fuel business achieved a gross margin for fiscal  as compared to achieved for fiscal this decrease resulted from an increase in the average price per gallon sold  partially offset by an increase in the average gross profit per gallon sold 
total operating expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of thousand  or  as compared to fiscal the increase resulted from higher compensation  professional fees  and information technology spending  and a million executive severance charge incurred in fiscal largely offsetting the increase in operating expenses was an million decrease in the provision for bad debts 
our income from operations for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal income from operations during fiscal and were attributable to the following segments fiscal year ended march  in thousands marine fuel services aviation fuel services corporate overhead total our marine fuel services segment earned million in income from operations for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase in the marine segment resulted from an improved gross profit per metric ton on traded and brokered transactions and a volume increase in metric tons sold 
partially offsetting was a volume decrease in metric tons brokered and increases in operating expenses  including the provision for bad debts 
our aviation segment s income from operations was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal this increase resulted from a decrease in the provision for bad debts and an improvement in the gross profit per gallon sold  partially offset by a decrease in gallons sold and an increase in compensation and other operating expenses 
corporate overhead costs not charged to the business segments totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase resulted from an executive severance charge  and higher compensation  professional fees  and information technology spending 
during fiscal  we reported million in other income  net  compared to other expense  net  of million  for fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a million non recurring charge in the marine segment due to the theft of product off the coast of nigeria  a thousand non recurring charge in the aviation segment related to a substantial write down of our investment in and advances to our previous aviation joint venture in ecuador  and a million special charge to the provision for bad debts in our previous aviation joint venture in ecuador related to certain customers based in ecuador 
also contributing to the variance were foreign exchange gains  increases in net interest income of million and a partial recovery of thousand related to the fiscal write down of our previous aviation joint venture in ecuador 
income taxes for fiscal reflect the impact of the executive severance and the provision for bad debts  for which we received an income tax benefit 
income taxes for fiscal reflect the impact of the provision for bad debts and non recurring losses in marine and aviation  for which we did not receive an income tax benefit 
thus  our effective income tax rate for fiscal decreased substantially as compared to fiscal net income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  as compared to a net loss of thousand for fiscal diluted income per share on income from continuing operations was for fiscal  as compared to a loss per share of in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred a net loss from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal including discontinued operations  net income for fiscal was million  an increase of million or  as compared to net income of million for fiscal diluted earnings per share of for fiscal increased  or  over the achieved during fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources in our marine and aviation fuel businesses  the primary use of working capital is to finance receivables 
we maintain aviation fuel inventories at certain locations in the united states  mostly for competitive reasons 
our marine and aviation fuel businesses historically have not required significant capital investment in fixed assets as we subcontract fueling services and maintain inventories at third party storage facilities 
we have funded our operations primarily with cash flow generated from operations 
as of march   we had million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to million at march  we also have a revolving credit facility for million with a sublimit of million for letters of credit 
our available borrowings under the credit facility are reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
as of march   we had no borrowings under the credit facility 
letters of credit of million were outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions  including restrictions on the payment of dividends in excess of specified amounts 
our failure to comply with the obligations under the credit facility  including meeting certain financial ratios  could result in an event of default 
an event of default  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility  or impair our ability to receive advances 
as of march   we were in compliance with the operating and financial requirements under the credit facility 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities totaled million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase in cash provided by continuing operating activities of million was primarily a result of higher operating income from continuing operations which increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and a lower days sales outstanding dso in our receivables 
cash provided by discontinued operations of million during fiscal was for the settlement payment from earthcare company on the remaining discontinued operating assets sold in fiscal for fiscal  cash used in our discontinued operations of million primarily pertains to the payment of income taxes on the operations and on the gain on the sale of our oil recycling operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  an increase of million as compared to fiscal we paid million in fiscal versus million in fiscal for the various marine segment acquisitions 
partially offsetting the increase in cash used in investing activities were a decrease in capital expenditures from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  cash received of thousand from the sale of leasehold property in fiscal  and cash used of million for our fiscal investment in the pafco aviation joint venture 
during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million as compared to million for fiscal the increase is due to an increase in dividends paid on common stock of million and the repayment of debt of million 
largely offsetting were cash received of million from employees exercise of stock options and a decrease in our purchases of treasury shares from million in fiscal to million in fiscal working capital at march  was million  representing an increase of million from working capital at march  our accounts and notes receivable  at march   excluding the allowance for bad debts  amounted to million  an increase of million  as compared to the balance at march  this increase is mostly related to the addition of accounts receivable from sales related to our fiscal acquisitions in the marine segment 
the allowance for bad debts at march  amounted to million as compared to million at march  during fiscal  we charged million to the provision for bad debts as compared to million for fiscal we had charge offs in excess of recoveries of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in our provision for bad debts and charge offs primarily reflects the refinement in our credit practices that resulted in an overall dso improvement to days for the fourth quarter of fiscal versus days for the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the decrease in our aviation segment reflects management s effort to reduce our credit exposure and increase margins  which began in the third quarter of fiscal prepaid expenses and other current assets increased million due to a higher deferred income tax asset and the equity in earnings of our pafco aviation joint venture 
partially offsetting was the receipt of the settlement payment from earthcare company related to the sale of the recycling operations 
capital expenditures for fiscal consisted primarily of computer equipment purchases and computer software development costs 
goodwill  identifiable intangible asset  and investment goodwill increased million  to million  due to our marine acquisitions consummated in fiscal in the aggregate  accounts payable  accrued expenses  customer deposits  and accrued salaries and wages increased million due to the additions of these current liabilities from operations related to our marine acquisitions 
short term debt and long term debt  in the aggregate  increased by million as a result of promissory notes issued and debt assumed in 
table of contents connection with our marine acquisitions in fiscal  partially offset by our principal payment of prior years promissory notes 
stockholders equity amounted to million  or in book value per share at march   compared to million  or in book value per share at march  the increase in stockholders equity was due to million in earnings and million received from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the declaration of dividends of million and million for the repurchase of our stock 
we believe that available funds from existing cash and cash equivalents  our credit facility  and cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for fiscal our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to obtain financing are based on currently available information

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to take advantage of favorable market conditions or for competitive reasons  we enter into short term cancelable fuel purchase commitments for the physical delivery of product 
we simultaneously may hedge the physical delivery of fuel through a commodity based derivative instrument  to minimize the effects of commodity price fluctuations 
we offer to our marine and aviation customers fixed fuel prices on future sales  generally involving the physical delivery of fuel  as part of our fuel management services 
typically  we simultaneously enter into a commodity based derivative instrument with a counterparty to hedge our variable fuel price on related future purchases for the physical delivery of fuel 
for non physical delivery of fuel  we simultaneously enter into commodity based derivative instruments with a counterparty 
the counterparties are major oil companies and derivative trading firms 
accordingly  we do not anticipate non performance by such counterparties 
pursuant to these transactions  we are not affected by market price fluctuations since the contracts 
table of contents have the same terms and conditions except for the fee or spread earned by us 
performance risk under these contracts is considered a credit risk 
this risk is minimized by dealing with customers meeting stricter credit criteria 
our policy is to not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of march   we had outstanding swaps contracts totaling thousand metric tons of marine fuel and outstanding swaps contracts totaling million gallons of aviation fuel  and these swaps contracts mature as follows in thousands marine fuel aviation fuel month of maturity metric tons gallons april may to june january to march april to june effective april   we adopted sfas no

we conduct the vast majority of our business transactions in us dollars 
however  in certain markets  primarily in mexico  payments to our aviation fuel supplier are denominated in local currency 
in addition  in mexico  payments from some of our customers are also denominated in local currency 
this subjects us to foreign currency exchange risk  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize the risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations through our regular operating and financing activities
