background our target market includes large and medium size enterprises  government organizations and service providers with numerous user communities  such as corporate employees and remote mobile users  as well as customers  partners  suppliers and consumers beyond the corporate firewall 
our target prospects in this market face the challenges of offering software enabled services  while reducing costs and maintaining high availability and reliability of digital assets on thousands to hundreds of thousands of computing devices  across heterogeneous environments and networks 
we are involved in markets that are variously called software management  device management  desktop and server management  asset management and configuration and change management 
gartner dataquest estimates the core markets of desktop management  software distribution  help desk  problem management  asset management and change management will grow from b in to b in  almost a cagr 
we also serve growth markets where change and configuration management provides significant value  including automated teller machines  point of sale  internet kiosks  telecom and other specialty devices 
demand for our solutions is fueled by two major information technology trends enterprise it expansion 
one of the key changes underway in the enterprise is its transformation from a firewall enclosed environment into an extended enterprise that is reaching out to a rapidly growing population of remote mobile users as well as partners and customers via the internet 
enterprises and government agencies are providing new e services requiring the provisioning of applications and content as part of new software enabled services for internal and external customers 
enterprise it management evolution 
the ongoing evolution and adoption of information technologies within the enterprise such as new operating system platforms  directory technologies  business applications and intranets  present significant management challenges 
for example  migrations to the windows xp platform includes a complete and continuous rollout of operating system and service packs  systems management and application packaging tools  directory server software  as well as new applications and upgrades from software providers 
the novadigm solution we provide unique configuration and change management solutions that automatically adapt to meet the demands of rapidly changing and increasingly complex it infrastructures 
with our automated  adaptive management solutions it organizations and service providers can offer a range of services from personalized software for individual end users to configuring software enabled services on web servers handling millions of personalized transactions 
the following highlights the distinctive capabilities of novadigm s solutions automation of the packaging  configuration analysis  discovery  targeting  deployment  updating  repair and removal of the full range of today s software and content  including shrink wrapped and custom 
table of contents built applications written in any language or composed of any type of distributed component  virus protection files  operating systems  registry keys  icons  embedded links  digital information  graphics  and full motion video across virtually any kind of network using a variety of protocols  including existing enterprise lans  wans  vans  intranets  extranets and the internet  as well as wireless networks and utilizing a variety of authentication and security techniques to the widest range of enterprise computing devices  including pcs  unix workstations  apple macintosh s and mobile devices  file  application and web servers  automated teller machines  point of sale terminals and internet kiosks 
we believe that our solutions meet the requirements of today s enterprises and service providers for solutions that automate the end to end lifecycle management process for software  content and other digital assets across large scale networks 
in addition  we believe that our solutions meet the requirements of enterprises transforming to new business models such as providing financial services to customers over the web  or migrating corporate it infrastructures to new operating platforms such as microsoft windows xp 
we believe that our customer implementations have proven our solutions to be cost effective  scalable to hundreds of thousands of users  able to reliably deploy software and content  and highly adaptable to each customer s applications  user audiences and computing platforms 
we also believe that our policy driven solutions support the dynamic and rapidly changing requirements of the customer s business 
technology our products enterprise desktop manager edm and the radia suite of products share a common e wrap technology architecture and desired state automation approach that automatically determines which software and content components are required for each individual user at the time of a configuration update 
the following are key attributes of our e wrap technology desired state automation 
our desired state approach discovers the actual state of each device and or user s software  configuration and content and compares this in real time with its desired state 
if there is a difference between the two  our differencing technology automatically determines the precise component level changes that are required and sends only those changes to the user s computer 
using this approach  we believe that components are deployed and updated significantly faster  more efficiently  and with higher levels of reliability  adaptability and scalability than conventional non desired state products 
adaptive configuration management 
our e wrap technology can automatically configure software packages and content for highly personalized user environments and install them as dictated by administrative policies or user preferences 
as program versions  user environments and preferences change  the affected user s actual state is automatically differenced and reconfigured to correspond to the desired state of operation  thus eliminating the need for manual user or administrator involvement 
policy based management 
our products use policy based access models to allow it administrators to efficiently and concisely define entitlements controlling the deployment of software and content to authorized users or subscribers 
for example  within the enterprise  an it administrator may implement a policy permitting access to certain financial databases only to a selected workgroup within an organization s finance department 
in an e commerce environment  subscribers would be automatically provided with software and content based on their entitlement in the customer database  without any additional activity required by an administrator 
subsequent changes to policies and entitlements cause software and content to be automatically installed  changed or de installed for all affected users  again without any administrator intervention 
this seamless integration between changing entitlements and automated provisioning is essential to meeting the personalized needs of users and subscribers in large scale enterprise and e business environments 

table of contents bandwidth optimization 
e wrap technology optimizes the use of network resources through comprehensive bandwidth management capabilities  which include multicasting  bandwidth throttling  configuration and component differencing  compression  and distributed caching 
our differencing processes calculate the precise changes needed to bring the software or content into its desired state  assuring a minimum of network traffic and wait time for bandwidth constrained networks 
rapid deployment and ease of use 
in addition to the shared architecture of our product suite  the flexible nature of its distributed object technology  and the ease of defining desired state  e wrap technology includes a variety of capabilities to ensure rapid deployment of complete software and content management solutions 
once installed  our solutions can be operated by a very small team of administrators to rapidly deploy and automatically manage large numbers of software and content 
we believe that our e wrap technology solutions establish a new standard for adaptive configuration and change management  and provide its customers with the most effective means for managing the next generation of e business applications and digital content  over both enterprise networks and the internet 
our unique technology completely automates the deployment and ongoing change management requirements of distributed software and content  ensures the necessary scalability to support the high and growing numbers of computing devices  and significantly reduces costs by eliminating manual installation and administration 
we believe that these advancements result in faster deployments  lower total cost of ownership tco  and higher levels of personalization  reliability  scalability  and auditability  which are key competitive factors for enterprises today and in the future 
architecture our e wrap technology provides the entire novadigm product suite with a shared set of foundation components  which are installed in varying combinations in customer and provider networks 
these components consist of management servers 
server based components containing a distributed multi domain object repository that synchronizes distributed objects application components  computer configurations  policy relationships across the network 
multiple management servers may be deployed in n tier configurations across enterprise and internet networks as desired to support large numbers of users and large volumes of software and content  to optimize limited network connections  and to allow for distributed administration 
managed clients 
lightweight components resident on managed computing devices that communicate with our management servers to identify  obtain  install  repair and delete software or content 
operating as an extension of standard pc or internet operating environments  the managed client automatically discovers current managed computer contents and synchronizes application versions with new or updated configurations residing on the management server 
administrators 
components resident on the administrator s desktop used to manage the object repository and the engine 
the administrator component contains a variety of graphical tools and utility programs used by customer administrators and technical staff to publish software and content components  specify policies and entitlements for users and control the overall operation of the management servers and managed client components 
these foundation components can be distributed across a variety of computing platforms component platforms management servers windows xp   and nt  aix  hp ux  mvs  solaris  novell  os  linux managed clients windows xp   nt     os  aix  hp ux  solaris  novell  macintosh  ncr gis  sgi irix  sco  linux communication between components is supported through a variety of protocols  including tcp ip  http  sna  ipx  and netbios 

table of contents integration another key capability of our e wrap technology is that it can be easily extended by us  our customers and partners  without programming  to manage any customer defined or industry standard software component including c  c  visual basic  java  activex  corba  component object model  and javascript or content format such as registry directory  hypertext mark up language  extensible mark up language  multi media  full motion video and animation 
the benefit of this approach is that it enables us and our customers and partners to quickly deploy emerging technologies and manage rapidly proliferating kinds of software and content across diverse and evolving platforms 
specialized management extensions and adapters offer our product integration capability with third party products without requiring special application programming interfaces or third party vendor coding 
we currently provide a variety of management extensions and adapters including network systems management frameworks

table of contents products in a timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
competition competition in the markets we serve is diverse and rapidly changing 
while a variety of vendors have offered some form of software distribution  asset management  infrastructure management or similar solutions with their offerings  our closest competitors today fall into the categories below framework sd vendors 
these competitors include ibm tivoli software and computer associates who offer software distribution tools as part of their enterprise frameworks 
we compete against the specific software distribution tools offered with their frameworks 
desktop management suite vendors 
these competitors include vendors such as microsoft and intel corporation  who offer software distribution tools as part of a desktop administration package 
software distribution vendors 
these competitors include companies such as altiris  inc  marimba  inc 
and on technology corporation in the desktop and server market segment  and  in the mobile market segment  xcellenet  inc we believe that we compete effectively with all of these vendors in our target market on the basis of our proven end to end solution and broader product line for software and content management 
additionally  we believe our other technology and business differentiators include comprehensive features functions  patented technologies including fractional differencing  desired state automation and adaptive configuration management  broader platform coverage and support for industry standards  higher product implementation success rates  extensive implementation and support services  and broader sales channels 
we differentiate our products in the market based on customer results that have proven our solutions are capable of end to end deployment and management of software and content faster  across larger and more diverse environments  with higher reliability and greater adaptability than other similar products 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively in the software management market or that our profitability or financial performance will not be adversely affected by increased competition 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  and many have significantly greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and larger customer installed bases 
moreover  there can be no assurance that either existing or new competitors will not develop products that are superior to our products or other technologies offering significant advantages over our technology  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights in december and in september  we were issued patents from the us patent office for key components of its desired state management process used in our software and content management products 
there can be no assurance that we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
moreover  there can be no assurance that protective measures taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology  and such measures may not preclude competitors from developing products with features similar to those of our products 
furthermore  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be limited or unavailable under the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions 
we also rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products 
although we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future products 
any such claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license 
table of contents agreements  provided such agreements were available on reasonable terms or at all 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any required license could have a material  adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we believe  however  that given the rapid pace of technological change in the industry  factors such as the technical expertise  knowledge and innovative skill of our management and technical personnel  our name recognition  the timeliness and quality of the support services we provide and our ability to offer frequent product enhancements and to develop  introduce and market new products are more significant in maintaining our competitive technology leadership position

overview we are a leading provider of software and configuration management solutions for enterprise and internet computing environments that enable organizations to reduce software management costs  speed time to market  expand marketing channels and open new sources of revenue 
our principal customers include the information technology it organizations of large and medium size enterprises and government organizations  service providers  outsourcers and software content providers with digital assets on thousands to hundreds of thousands of computing devices  across heterogeneous environments and networks 
we were incorporated in delaware in february through september  our primary efforts were devoted to product development 
in october  version of the enterprise desktop manager edm was released for general availability 
version was released in february  version in june  and the final version  was released in october in november  we released radia software manager  a publisher managed  internet based software and content management solution 
in november  we announced the general availability of radia version as well as the radia application manager  a subscriber managed  internet based software and content management solution 
in december  we followed with the release of radia inventory manager  a policy driven  digital asset inventory tool that automatically discovers information about hardware and software  and consolidates the results into web based reports 
we continue to develop the radia product family  adding new features  applications and platforms 
in october  radia management suite was released 
we have three primary sources of revenue 
license revenue is generated from licensing the rights to use our software products to end users and from sublicense fees from resellers of our software products 
we generate maintenance revenues from providing renewable support and software update rights to license customers 
lastly  we earn revenue from consulting and training activities performed for license customers 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition as amended by sop critical accounting policies we believe our critical accounting policies to be revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets 
revenue recognition 
as discussed above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recognize revenue in all transactions involving the licensing of software products in accordance with the provisions of sop no 
 software revenue recognition as amended by sop no 
most of our licensing transactions are on a perpetual basis and revenue is recognized upon shipment of the software if evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
shipment of the software is generally performed by the physical delivery of a cd or by electronic delivery of the licensed software 
evidence of an arrangement generally takes the form of a software license agreement signed by the customer and by us 
in the case of an existing license customer  additional orders may come in the form of an addendum to the software license agreement  a purchase order  order letter  or similar authorizing document from the customer 
we evaluate whether the software transaction has a fixed and determinable price 
a key factor in this evaluation is the payment terms in relation to our experience with the customer or with a similar class of customers 
generally  software transactions have terms of less than one year and have no unresolved acceptance criteria or similar contingency 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are recognized upon 
table of contents the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
we evaluate the probability of collection based upon the creditworthiness of the customer 
we allocate revenue on software transactions involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
our software transactions frequently involve multiple elements  most commonly bundled maintenance and services 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we analyze all of the elements and determine whether we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to maintenance  consulting and training components included in multiple element arrangements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  where the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the revenue allocated to licenses generally is recognized upon delivery of the products 
the revenue allocated to maintenance is generally recognized ratably over the term of the support  typically months  and revenue allocated to consulting and training elements generally is recognized as the services are performed 
if evidence of the fair value for all undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such evidence exists or until all elements are delivered 
we enter into reseller arrangements that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to us based on a percentage of list price 
reseller arrangements may include non refundable payments in the form of guaranteed sublicense fees 
guaranteed sublicense fees from resellers are recognized as revenue upon shipment of the master copy of all software to which the guaranteed sublicense fees relate if the reseller is creditworthy and if the terms of the agreement are such that the payment obligation is not subject to price adjustment  is non cancelable and non refundable and due within days 
these guaranteed sublicense fees are applied against sublicense fees reported by the reseller in relicensing our products to end users 
thousand  and million in guaranteed sublicense fees were recognized in  and  respectively 
as of march   a substantial majority of all such guaranteed sublicense fees recognized by us have been placed with end users or forfeited by the reseller 
allowance for doubtful account 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay 
the allowance is regularly evaluated  by customer and in the aggregate  for adequacy taking into consideration past experience  credit quality  age of the receivable balances  and current economic conditions 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance 
we provided a valuation allowance of million against our entire net deferred tax asset as of march  this valuation allowance was recorded given the losses we have incurred through march  and the uncertainties regarding our future operating profitability and taxable income  all of which require significant management judgments 
all period references in the discussion below and in the remainder of item are to fiscal periods based on our fiscal year ending march 
table of contents results of operations for the periods indicated  the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by the respective line items in our statements of operations 
years ended march  revenues licenses maintenance and services total revenues operating expenses cost of maintenance and services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended march  and revenues total revenues increased in to million 
license revenues increased to million in license revenues represented of our total revenues in compared to of our total revenues in this increase in license revenues in over the prior year was primarily the result of closing a greater number of contracts at a higher average contract size 
demand for our products increased from both new and existing customers due  we believe  to more effective marketing programs  better market awareness and creation of marketing alliances and partnerships 
maintenance and services revenues increased to million 
this increase in maintenance and services revenues in over the prior year was primarily due to the increased demand for our consulting services associated with the eds contract for the navy marine corps intranet project as well as higher license activity in in addition  maintenance services increased in over the prior year due to an expanding customer base 
during  one customer  eds  accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
operating expenses cost of maintenance and services includes the costs of providing customer support and update rights and consulting and training services to our customers 
these costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits  travel and lodging expenses  third party consulting fees and allocated overhead 
cost of maintenance and services increased by to million in the gross margin of maintenance and services was in  
table of contents slightly lower than the of the prior year 
the primary reason for the lower gross margin in as compared to the prior year is the faster growth rate of consulting and training services compared to maintenance 
consulting and training services require higher staffing levels than maintenance operations and therefore have a lower gross margin 
we expect the cost of maintenance and services to increase in in absolute dollar terms and we expect the gross margin of maintenance and services to remain approximately the same as the level 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  commissions  travel and other costs associated with sales and marketing efforts such as marketing programs  trade shows  and lead generation activities 
in addition  the expense for doubtful accounts is included in sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million 
the increase in over the previous year was primarily the result of higher marketing expenses for trade shows  public relations  user conferences and other marketing programs  as well as higher commission expense associated with the recording of higher revenue 
during  we created a new sales organization to manage and grow our alliances and partnerships  also additional sales management was brought on in to strengthen our sales efforts 
accordingly  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in compared to in absolute dollar terms though not as a percentage of total revenues 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  consultant fees and other costs associated with research and development efforts 
research and development expenses increased to million 
the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to the previous year was primarily due to the ongoing development of new products which provide additional functionality and ease of use and operate on additional platforms 
during  we released a new version of radia  version  as well as announced eleven new products 
we believe that a significant investment in research and development activities is essential to provide for our future growth 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest resources to further enhance and develop our products 
we anticipate growth in research and development expense in though we do not anticipate that research and development expense will increase in terms of a percentage of total revenues 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  software development costs are capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility  which we define as establishment of a working model 
capitalizable amounts are insignificant and  accordingly  we have expensed all software development costs as incurred 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and travel costs for corporate management  finance and administration  information systems and human resources  as well as corporate insurance programs and fees for professional services such as consulting  legal  accounting and recruiting 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the increase in as compared with was due primarily to providing approximately million associated with a settlement of an arbitration dispute with a former employee  higher legal fees associated with the arbitration dispute as well as other litigation see part i  item legal proceedings  and higher compensation costs due to expanding our corporate management and administrative staff 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in though we do not anticipate general and administration expense to increase in terms of a percentage of total revenues 
amortization of intangible was million in and consists of i a charge to earnings for the non cash amortization of the intangible asset acquired in the alliance agreement with hewlett packard and ii an acquisition of intellectual property in october in june  we entered into an alliance agreement with hewlett packard to integrate  market and sell our software and content management products with hewlett packard s hp openview management solutions for the enterprise and service providers markets 
as part of the agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to hewlett packard and a warrant for an additional  shares of our common stock 
both the shares issued and the warrant contained restrictions 
in addition to the alliance agreement  and for a fee of  hewlett packard was provided a one year  limited license to upgrade certain existing customers to

the fair value of the equity issued  less the cash received from hewlett packard  or million  was recorded as an intangible asset at june   and will be amortized over the initial term of the agreement two years 
included in the warrant is a provision that reduces the exercise price of the warrant to if hewlett packard attains certain revenue milestones 
should hewlett packard meet those milestones  the intangible asset will be adjusted and the new amount will be amortized for the remainder of the term 
we currently do not expect hewlett packard to meet these milestones 
in october  we acquired the intellectual property of another company 
we will embed this acquired technology into our radia product suite

maintenance and service revenues increased to million 
the increase in maintenance and service revenues in over the prior year was primarily due to the increased demand for our consulting and training services associated with higher licensing activity with new customers and the high rate of renewal of maintenance contracts by existing customers 
the increase in maintenance revenues in over was at a rate lower than in prior years due to the termination of our agreement with amdahl

in october  we announced our intention to repurchase up to  of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
on august   our board of directors increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase to a total of  shares 
additionally  in september  the securities and exchange commission issued temporary regulations easing restrictions on the repurchases of stock by public companies

the line of credit has a term of one year and is renewable on an annual basis 
at march   no amounts were due and outstanding under this revolving line of credit 

table of contents our cost for intellectual property acquired in october was  net of acquisition costs of  and is payable through the issuance of  shares of our common stock and payment of million over quarters 
as of march    shares of our common stock had been issued and payments totaling thousand had been made 
we will issue  shares and make a cash payment of thousand quarterly through december  the value of our shares to be issued and cash to be paid have been accrued in the accompanying balance sheet 
accordingly  million is included in accrued liabilities and million is reflected as long term liabilities 
we have allocated the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired to acquired software and are amortizing this amount over three years 
at march   we held notes receivable with a total value of million due from executive officers and shareholders 
the notes bear a fair market interest rate determined at the time the note was written 
the notes are full recourse and are secured by shares of our common stock 
the notes have a term of one year and allow for prepayment

during fiscal  issuers of the notes repaid thousand of the outstanding balance  thousand of new notes were issued and thousand in associated interest was accrued 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of march  this table should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements in thousands note payable operating leases fiscal year ending march  total the note payable represents the associated cash payments in connection with the intellectual property acquired in october  as discussed above 
although it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from operations  will be adequate to finance our operations for at least the months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent we experience growth in the future  we anticipate that our operating and investing activities may use cash 
we may decide to raise additional funds  through public or private debt or equity financing  to fund future growth or continuing operations  take advantage of expansion or acquisition opportunities  develop new products or compete effectively in the marketplace 
however  additional funds may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  when we require them  and any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity linked securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below because they could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
we have a history of operating losses and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we have reported an operating loss for every quarter since our incorporation in february except for the four consecutive quarters in each of and  and the last three quarters of we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our quarterly results are subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors and our operating results vary due to seasonality 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to 
table of contents fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including  among others  the size and timing of customer orders  the timing and market acceptance of our new products  the level and pricing of international sales  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the level of operating expenses  technological advances and competitive conditions in the industry 
revenues received from our individual customers vary significantly based on the size of the product installation 
customer orders for our products have ranged from several thousands of dollars to over million  and have averaged from approximately  to  as a result  our quarterly operating results are likely to be significantly affected by the number and size of customer orders we are able to obtain in any particular quarter 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is lengthy and unpredictable  and may range from a few months to over a year  depending upon the interest of the prospective customer in our products  the size of the order which may involve a significant commitment of capital by the customer  the decision making and acceptance procedures within the customer s organization  the complexity of implementation and other factors 
we generally ship orders as received and as a result typically have little or no backlog 
quarterly revenues and operating results therefore depend upon the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
historically  we have recognized the substantial majority of our quarterly license revenues in the last weeks or week of each quarter 
in addition  because our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses are based in large part on anticipated revenues  a substantial portion of which are not typically generated until the end of each quarter  the timing and amount of revenues associated with orders have caused  and may continue to cause  significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
our operating results are also expected to vary significantly due to seasonal trends 
historically  we have realized a greater percentage of our annual revenues in the fourth quarter  and a lower percentage in the first and second quarters 
we believe that this seasonality is in part a result of efforts of our direct sales personnel to meet annual sales quotas  and in part a result of lower international revenues in the summer months when many businesses in europe experience lower sales 
in addition  capital budgets of our customers  which tend to concentrate spending activity at calendar year end  have had  and may continue to have  a seasonal influence in our quarterly operating results 
we expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these and other factors  and that seasonality may increase if our efforts to expand our international sales are successful 
our business may suffer if we are not able to keep pace with rapid technological change and successfully introduce new products 
the market for software and configuration management is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  achieve market acceptance and respond to customer requirements that are constantly evolving 
responding to rapid technological change and the need to develop and introduce new products to meet customers expanding needs will require us to make substantial investments in research and product development 
during fiscal  among other research and development expenditures  we allocated research and development funding to the development of our e wrap technology to additional platforms in operating systems and a new version of radia 
we intend to continue to allocate funding to these development projects throughout fiscal if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  and in particular advances in client server enterprise hardware platforms  internet applications and platforms  operating systems and systems management applications  or experience any significant delays in product development or introduction  we could lose competitiveness and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that any product enhancements or new products we develop will gain market acceptance 
the failure to develop on a timely basis new products or product enhancements could cause customers to delay or refrain from purchasing our existing products and thereby adversely affect our operating results 
if future releases of new products and enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  the business  financial condition and results of our operations will be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents problems with our software could materially affect our business 
software products as complex as those offered by us may contain undetected errors or failures that  despite our significant testing  are discovered only after a product has been installed and used by customers 
such errors could cause delays in product introductions and shipments  require design modifications  result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  or loss of existing customers  any of which could adversely affect the business  financial condition and results of our operations 
intense competition in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect us 
competition in the markets we serve is diverse and rapidly changing 
while a variety of vendors have offered some form of software distribution  asset management  infrastructure management or similar solutions with their offerings  our closest competitors today fall into the categories below framework sd vendors 
these competitors include ibm tivoli software and computer associates who offer software distribution tools as part of their enterprise frameworks 
we compete against the specific software distribution tools offered with their frameworks 
desktop management suite vendors 
these competitors include vendors such as microsoft and intel corporation  who offer software distribution tools as part of a desktop administration package 
software distribution vendors 
these competitors include companies such as altiris  inc  marimba  inc 
and on technology corporation in the desktop and server market segment  and  in the mobile market segment  xcellenet  inc we may not be able to continue to compete effectively in the software management market and our profitability or financial performance could be adversely affected by increased competition 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  and many have significantly greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and larger customer installed bases 
moreover  existing or new competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or other technologies offering significant advantages over our technology  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
the market price and trading volume of our common stock have been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock has been highly volatile 
the trading price and trading volume of our common stock has been  and could in the future be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our operating and financial results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in prices to our or our competitors products and services  changes in product mix  change in our revenue and revenue growth rates for us as a whole or for individual geographic areas  products or product categories  as well as other events or factors 
statements or changes in opinions  ratings  or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business or relating to us specifically have resulted  and could in the future result in  an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the nasdaq national market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for the securities of many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business could be materially affected by risks related to our international operations 
approximately of our net revenues in were derived from our international operations 
international revenues are a significant percentage of our revenues  and we plan to continue to develop international sales  primarily through our european operations 
our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by factors associated with international operations  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  uncertainties relative to regional economic circumstances  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable 
table of contents collection  changes in regulatory requirements and product localization requirements  as well as by other factors associated with international activities 
a majority of our international revenues and costs have been denominated in foreign currencies 
we believe that an increasing portion of our international revenues and costs will be denominated in foreign currencies in the future 
to date  we have not engaged in any foreign exchange hedging transactions and we are therefore subject to foreign currency risk 
the loss of a major customer could adversely affect our operating results 
during and  one customer  eds  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues 
during  one customer  amdahl  accounted for approximately of total revenues 
because we depend on proprietary technology  there are risks of infringement that could materially and adversely affect our results 
our success will be heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which provide only limited protection 
it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in particular  we may provide our respective licensees with access to our proprietary information underlying our licensed applications 
the means we use to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology 
policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement with respect to our current or future products 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in their industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition see part i  item legal proceedings 
we could be subject to product liability claims that would adversely affect our business 
the license agreements  which we enter into with our customers  typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  the limitation of liability provisions contained in such license agreements may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
the sale and support of our products entails the risk of claims  and we may be subject to such claims in the future 
a product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the loss of our executives and key employees could adversely affect us 
our future success depends upon the contributions of our executives and key employees

table of contents our ability to effectively grow depends on our ability to improve our operational systems 
we have expanded our operations rapidly since inception and intend to continue to expand in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this rapid growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources

the success of potential future acquisitions depends on our ability to integrate and manage the additions to our business 
we may acquire other businesses in the future  which would complicate our management tasks 
we may need to integrate widely dispersed operations that have different and unfamiliar corporate cultures 
these integration efforts may not succeed or may distract management s attention from existing business operations 
our failure to successfully manage future acquisitions could adversely affect our business

we may need additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
in the future  we may need or otherwise decide to raise additional funds and we cannot be certain that we would be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
further  if we issue equity securities  our current stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
if we cannot raise funds  if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
changes the accounting for business combinations  requiring that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method and that intangible assets be recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights  or if they are separable or capable of being separated from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
specifies the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires that the useful lives of intangible assets acquired on or before june   be reassessed and the remaining amortization periods adjusted accordingly 
previously recognized intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives shall be tested for impairment 
goodwill recognized on or before june   shall be assigned to one or more reporting units and shall be tested for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which sfas no 
is initially applied in its entirety 
we have not fully assessed the potential impact of the adoption of sfas no 
 which is effective for us as of april  the reassessment of intangible assets must be completed during the first quarter of fiscal and the assignment of goodwill to reporting units  along with completion of the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment tests  must be completed during the first six months of our fiscal year total amortization of intangible assets for the year ended march  was approximately million 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supercedes sfas and certain provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations  be measured at the lower of carrying 
table of contents amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas also broadens the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity that have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
the provisions of sfas are effective beginning after april  we are currently in the process of assessing the effects of implementing the new standard 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts and contracts receivable and accounts payable 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the majority of our operations are based in the us and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
these currencies have been relatively stable to somewhat devaluing against the us dollar for the past several years 
foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on our revenues or results of operations 
currently  we have operations in the united kingdom  france and germany and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
although we currently derive no material revenues from highly inflationary economies  we are expanding our presence in international markets outside europe  including the pacific rim and latin america  whose currencies have tended to fluctuate more relative to the us dollar 
there can be no assurance that european currencies will remain stable relative to the us dollar or that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  revenues or financial condition 
to date  the impact of fluctuations in these currencies resulted in net transaction gains losses of thousand  thousand and thousand in  and  respectively 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in obligations of the us government and its agencies  investment grade state and local government obligations securities of us corporations rated a or p by standard poors or the moody s equivalents  and or money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by us commercial banks meeting certain credit rating and net worth requirements 
at march   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of demand deposits and money market funds held by large institutions in the us  and our short term investments were invested in corporate debt maturing in less than days
