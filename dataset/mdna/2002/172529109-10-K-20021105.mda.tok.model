item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
of the securities and exchange commission  requests that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by ciprico inc the company  we and our 
general management s discussion and analysis of ciprico s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of receivables and inventories 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods up to three years 
we accrue a warranty reserve within cost of sales for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
we estimate the costs to service our warranty obligations based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
revenue from the sale of extended warranty and maintenance agreements is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related agreement 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we can not guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to reduce excess and obsolete inventory so estimated market value based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months or expected life of the representative product 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
we do not adjust our lower of cost or market adjustment to inventory components upward once a reduction was determined to be necessary 
we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  however any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an adjustment of  to reduce certain legacy product inventory to market value due to excess estimated inventory levels of certain legacy products discontinued during fiscal and planned product migration of new product introductions released in fiscal or scheduled for release in early fiscal warranty our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of each balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that our estimate is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  we would increase our warranty accrual resulting in decreased gross profit 
similarly  if the opposite occurs and we experience better than expected results  we would decrease our warranty accrual 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of ciprico inc and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this report 
overview ciprico inc designs  manufactures and markets storage and system solutions for digital media applications 
our solutions combine storage  networking and computing technologies to simplify and accelerate digital media workflows 
our primary markets are broadcast and entertainment  which include applications in digital broadcast and film and video production and military and government which include applications involving the data capture  processing and dissemination of surveillance images 
in addition  we have historically sold in other markets with high performance storage requirements such as geosciences  digital prepress and medical imaging 
the following table sets forth certain items from ciprico s consolidated statement of operations  as a percentage of net sales for the years ending september net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses loss from operations net sales comparative information on sales by market and geographic location are shown in the charts below in millions 
market sales of total sales of total sales of total broadcast entertainment military government other total geographic location sales of total sales of total sales of total domestic international total sales for were approximately million  a decrease of from sales  which decreased 
from levels 
sales from customers within the united states increased during versus an increase of in from sales 
sales from international customers decreased in and in from the previous year 
we believe our sales in fiscal and were adversely impacted by the economic downturn and its effect on customer demand 
we believe the effect of the economy on demand for our products was further impacted by the september  attack on the united states 
the decline in international sales for reflects decreased volumes with post production customers  primarily from asia pacific regions following the closure of our singapore and tokyo offices during the fourth quarter of fiscal our international sales throughout fiscal and were also impacted by economic factors in europe and asia pacific regions and reduced sales through silicon graphics  inc sgi 
sales in the broadcast segment decreased in versus an increase of in versus the decline in primarily reflects reduced spending levels in this segment as a result of the general economic slowdown 
the decline was partially offset by increased sales of approximately million from two broadcast oem customers between years 
the sales increase in reflects higher sales in our domestic operations resulting from our increased focus during the past two years on expanding opportunities with broadcast oem customers 
this was offset by lower demand experienced from both european and asia pacific customers  including sgi 
sales in the military and government market increased in fiscal and during fiscal  which primarily reflects higher demand in our domestic operations from a number of system integrators for certain defense related projects 
in  we shipped approximately  of our new talon product to new and existing customers in the military segment 
sales in the military segment have historically fluctuated between years due to the timing of spending on defense related programs 
the decline in sales in the other market segments during the past three years primarily reflects reduced demand from a medical imaging integrator and sgi 
sales to sgi were million in  million in and million in this reduction with sgi also reflects a shift in our strategy during the past three years of developing products and opportunities that support more open system platforms 
our revenue growth in the future is dependent on our ability to provide new products and expand the applications of our products into targeted market segments 
the netarray family of products was released in fiscal sales from netarray products were approximately million in  million in and million in the netarray product provided us expanded market opportunities for raid applications and contributed to the growth in domestic sales in each of the primary market segments 
we expect to release our fibrestore at the end of calendar  which we believe will result in a migration of customer demand from the netarray and our legacy products 
cost of sales and gross profit gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was in  in and in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non recurring adjustment of  to reduce certain legacy product inventory to market value 
the decline in margins in and reflects increased sales of the netarray product  particularly in the broadcast segment  which carries lower margins 
in addition our gross profit margins for fiscal have been adversely impacted by flattened disk drive costs versus continued price competition  particularly on higher capacity disk drives sold 
gross profit on product sales is highly dependent on the cost of disk drives and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we believe our strong vendor relations will aid in component availability and cost reductions to meet continued competitive pricing pressures 
we expect to experience continued competitive pressures on gross profit margins throughout fiscal  which could result in a further decline in our margins 
we intend to partially offset these margin pressures through new product introductions and cost reductions 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased approximately  or in and million or in versus the increase in includes approximately  of costs related to the sanstar acquisition  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in primarily reflects increases in engineering staff and prototype expenses associated with new products  including the fibrestore and talon  as well as spending related to software development activities for dimeda  our new digital media appliance product family 
the increase in is primarily attributable to significant investments made in our software and dimeda product development activities through the addition of new personnel including the addition of the software development team in new jersey following the sanstar acquisition 
we currently do not sell software separately from our hardware 
we expect that research and development expenses will decrease slightly in absolute dollars in fiscal as we shift our focus towards software development  which is expected to reduce the level of hardware prototype expenses in our product development activities 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately million or in versus an increase of  or in compared to the reduction in reflects reduced headcount between years resulting from our restructuring efforts implemented during fiscal along with lower sales compensation related to reduced gross profit dollars between years 
the increase in primarily reflects added personnel in sales  product marketing and sales engineering in addition to higher promotional expenses associated with our efforts to expand our presence in certain vertical markets 
we expect these expenses to decrease slightly in absolute dollars during fiscal as a result of cost reductions implemented during the second half of fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were relatively unchanged between and and increased approximately  or in as compared to in the fourth quarter of  we recorded costs of approximately  related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
the increase in is due to lower expense in the prior year due to adjustments in bad debt provisions in addition to the costs associated with the implementation of new information systems 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal due to anticipated higher insurance costs 
restructuring in september  we implemented a workforce reduction of and further consolidation of our sales operations in europe 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded a charge of  during the fourth quarter of  of which approximately  is employee termination costs and  is facility closure and related costs 
these restructuring efforts are expected to reduce approximately  from our fiscal operating expenses levels 
during fiscal  we implemented two restructuring efforts 
in may we implemented a cost reduction program including the reduction of our workforce by and the closing of our singapore sales office 
in september we made further restructuring changes through the consolidation of certain sales and marketing management positions and the closing of our sales office in japan 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded charges of  during fiscal of which approximately  is employee termination costs and  is facility closure and related costs 
other income other income of  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  is primarily attributable to interest income on cash and marketable securities 
the decrease in and reflects overall lower interest rates on lower average cash and investment balances 
income tax expense for the income tax benefit of million reflects recognition of current income tax benefits related to federal income tax refunds received or expected to be received under the provisions of the job creation and worker assistance act of  enacted on march  of the million  approximately  was recorded in the fourth quarter of when the amount of loss for the year became known 
the effective income tax expense benefit was in  in and in see note to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had a total of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared to million at the end of and million at the end of cash flows from used in operating activities were  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the change between years primarily reflects the operating losses offset by overall lower working capital requirements in fiscal capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for will approximate million due to anticipated spending on product development activities 
during and we repurchased  and  shares  respectively  at a total cost of approximately  and  respectively 
the total amount authorized to be expended under the stock buyback program is million 
as of september    shares of common stock have been repurchased for million 
despite the cost reduction efforts implemented during fiscal and  we expect to incur an operating loss in fiscal due to continued investments expected in new product development 
we believe that current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund requirements for operating losses  working capital and capital expenditures  and share repurchases  as well as any potential acquisitions in fiscal we have signed a year operating lease for a new corporate headquarters which commenced in october the lease provides for base rental payments of approximately  for the first thirty six months with increases of approximately each subsequent month period 
the lease also includes provisions for early termination after and years 
additionally  we are responsible for our proportionate share of real estate taxes and operating expenses associated with operating the facility  as defined by the lease agreement 
we expect our operating expenses for fiscal to be reduced slightly based on the estimated costs of the new facility 
in the fourth quarter of we incurred approximately  of costs in connection with the relocation 
in addition  we expect to incur capital expenditures up to  associated with the new facility during fiscal new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no
