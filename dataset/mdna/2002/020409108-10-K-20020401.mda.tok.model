item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of financial statements as a result of accounting errors  the company has restated its previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and  and its previously issued financial results for the quarterly periods in those fiscal years and the quarterly periods ended june and september  previously reported net income has been reduced by approximately  or per diluted share in the year ended march  and  or per diluted share in the year ended march  the components of the restatement and its effect on previously issued financial statements are set forth below and in note to the accompanying financial statements 
the effect on quarterly financial information is set forth in note to the financial statements 
on february   the company issued a press release stating  and notified the securities and exchange commission  that it expected to restate its financial statements 
the company has adopted significant changes in its administrative procedures and internal controls relating to accounting for its self insurance programs  including requirements that third party financial information be provided to both financial accounting and operating personnel  improvements in the methodology for expensing the cost of claims incurred but not paid  and year end validation by third party experts of the company s estimated liability for unpaid claims 
on february   the board of directors appointed a special committee of two independent directors  tyree wilburn and jonathan goldberg  and directed the committee to investigate the causes of the accounting errors 
as authorized by the board  the special committee retained counsel wilmer  cutler pickering previously unaffiliated with the company to assist its inquiry  and counsel in turn engaged forensic accountants ten eyck associates  inc also unaffiliated with the company 
the investigation of the special committee is substantially complete 
the principal conclusions are that a former officer  the vice president of human resources responsible for managing the company s self insurance programs  negligently  and at times intentionally  provided inaccurate information to the company s financial accounting staff  and to its independent public accountants  that caused the company to record a receivable to which it was not entitled and to understate certain liabilities  particularly with respect to the medical  workers compensation and automobile self insurance programs 
the board has asked the special committee to make additional recommendations to improve the company s administrative processes and internal controls  make a recommendation regarding whether to pursue legal action against the former officer  and report the results of the inquiry to the securities and exchange commission 
the company anticipates that the after tax cost of conducting the investigation into this matter  consisting primarily of professional fees  will be approximately  or per diluted share 
this cost will be included in the company s results of operations for the quarter ended march  components of the restatement and their approximate effect on previously reported net income loss  are set forth in the following table amounts rounded to nearest thousand dollars march  march  increase in health self insurance expense   increase in workers compensation and automobile self insurance expense   additional revenues recorded from amending medicare and medicaid cost reports due to restatement   total reduction in pretax income due to restatement   income tax effect   total reduction in net income due to restatement   income tax effect net income loss as previously   reported net income loss as restated   basic earnings loss per share as previously reported as restated diluted earnings loss per share as previously reported as restated as shown in note to the financial statements the self insurance accounting issues described above also resulted in a reduction of net income of  or per diluted share and  or per diluted share in the quarters ended june and september  respectively 
decision to retain vn operations on september   the company announced that its board of directors voted to terminate its previously adopted plan of disposition for its visiting nurse vn operations 
this decision followed a period of extensive analysis and evaluation of numerous alternatives for the business unit 
in the board s judgment  given the significant external and internal changes that have taken place with regard to the future prospects of the vn segment  retaining the vn segment was the best option available to maximize shareholder value 
in the accompanying financial statements  the company has  in accordance with applicable accounting rules terminated the use of discontinued operations accounting treatment for the vn segment 
vn segment results are now reported as an on going part of the continuing operations of the company for all periods presented 
as a result of the decision to retain its vn segment  the company recorded  in the nine months ended december   a one time after tax gain of approximately million  or per diluted share  resulting from the reversal of the remainder of accounting reserves originally recorded at the time discontinued operations accounting treatment was adopted for this segment 
change in fiscal year end also on september   the company announced that it has changed its fiscal year end from march to december effective december  pursuant to the securities exchange act of  the accompanying financial statements included herein present audited information for the nine months ended december   and for the twelve months ended march  and to facilitate the an understanding of current operating results  management s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations includes the nine months ended december  compared to the unaudited results for the nine months ended december  critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  the company selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
receivables and revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the related patient services are provided 
receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by management to be their net realizable values 
certain classes of patients rely on a common source of funds to pay the cost of their care  such as the federal medicare program and various state medicaid programs 
medicare program revenues for the years prior to the implementation of the prospective payment system and certain medicaid program revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by government representatives 
the company believes that any differences between the net revenues recorded and final determination will not materially affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor types  historical collection trends and aging categories 
the company calculates its reserve for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage applied to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on historical experience and has been consistently applied 
insurance programs self insurance programs 
the company bears significant risk under its self insured employee health  automobile and workers compensation programs 
the company s self insured health program has an excess loss insurance policy that reimburses the company for covered expenses up to a certain amount of a specific deductible for each covered person and an annual aggregate deductible for all covered claims 
the company s current excess loss insurance policy ends april  based on information provided by its broker and third party administrator  the company expects health insurance costs to increase between to during due to the inflation of medical care costs 
under its automobile and workers compensation self insurance programs  the company bears risk up to  per incident 
the company records estimated liabilities for its health  automobile  and workers compensation self insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
the company monitors its estimated liabilities on a quarterly basis and  when necessary  may make material adjustments to them in the future 
other insurance 
the company s properties are covered by casualty insurance policies 
the company also carries directors and officers  general and professional liability insurance 
the company s deductible amount for general and professional claims was  per claim prior to july  and  thereafter 
the company believes that its present insurance coverage is adequate 
however  in the wake of the terrorist events of september   the company s outside insurance agent has advised that the annual cost of its insurance programs excluding health will increase by approximately   after tax upon renewal on april  the company also has been advised that it is possible that the amount of coverage the company is able to purchase may decline 
impairment of property  equipment and intangible assets the company evaluates its property and equipment and intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or the life of the asset may need to be changed 
the company considers internal and external factors of the individual facility or asset  including changes in the regulatory environment  changes in national health care trends  current period cash flow loss combined with a history of cash flow losses and local market developments 
if these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flow of the entity over its remaining life indicate that the asset will not be recoverable  the carrying value will be adjusted to its fair value if it is lower 
there were no impairment charges recorded during the nine months ended december   however  if the projections or assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for its assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
these statements established new accounting and reporting standards for business combinations and associated goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas  which took effect immediately  eliminated the pooling of interest method of accounting and amortization of goodwill for business combinations initiated after june  sfas  effective january   requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the company is currently in the process of determining the impact of these standards on the company s results of operations and financial position 
the initial test for impairment  pursuant to sfas  will be completed by the company by june  the accompanying income statements include goodwill amortization expense of approximately   and  in the nine months ended december  and the years ended march  and respectively 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
this statement supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions for apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and it broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas as of january   and is currently evaluating the impact sfas may have on its financial position and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes as of december   the company has net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
the net deferred tax asset is composed of approximately million of long term deferred tax assets and million of long term deferred tax liabilities 
the company has provided a valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets based upon management s estimation of realizability of those assets through future taxable income 
this valuation was based in large part on the company s history of generating operating income or losses in individual tax locales and expectations for the future 
the company s ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  competitive pressures on revenues and margins and legislation and regulation at all levels of government 
management has considered the above factors in reaching its conclusion that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will meet its expectations of future taxable income 
operating segments the company operates in two reportable business segments adult day health services adhs  and visiting nurses vn 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company s adhs segment includes the aggregation of its adc in center operations and in home personal care operations  both of which provide predominantly long term health care and custodial services that enable recipients to avoid nursing home admission 
sources of reimbursement  reimbursement rates per day and contribution margins from the company s adc and personal care operations are substantially alike 
the company s vn segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
approximately of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per client basis rather than a fee per visit or day of care 
general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level have not been allocated to the segments 
the company has operations in alabama  connecticut  florida  indiana  kentucky  maryland  massachusetts  and ohio 
financial information for the company s two operating segments is presented in note to the financial statements 
seasonality the company s adhs segment normally experiences seasonality in its operating results 
specifically  the quarters ended december and march typically generate lower operating income than the quarters ended june and september as the holiday season and winter weather tend to temporarily lower adc in center attendance  particularly in maryland and connecticut 
partially offsetting this  the company s vn segment operations located in southeast and southwest florida normally experience higher admissions during the march quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations

likewise operating income before unallocated corporate expense improved million during the period ended december  primarily as a result of the company s actions to adapt its operations to the new medicare pps reimbursement system which took effect on october  unallocated corporate overhead increased as a result of additional expenditures in information systems  additional staff support for operational audits and communication and increased compensation expense 
refer to the segment discussions below for additional information 
the increase in interest is primarily a result of higher average outstanding debt levels associated with the company s use of approximately million for the repurchase of a large block of the company s stock in march  partially offset by lower interest rates in the effective income tax rate was approximately of income before income taxes in as compared to an effective income tax rate of approximately in the december and march periods 
the higher tax rate used in the prior periods was a result of taxable losses incurred in certain state and local jurisdictions and the establishment of a valuation allowance against the realizability of the related net operating loss carryforwards 
taxable income was generated in those jurisdictions in adult day health services adhs segment nine months ended december  and unaudited and the year ended march  as restated the company s adhs segment includes the aggregation of its adc in center operations and in home personal care operations  both of which predominantly provide long term health care and custodial services that enable patients to avoid nursing home admission

as shown in the table above  the vn operations incurred losses in the december and march periods as a result of operating under the old cost based reimbursement system for portions of each period 
in the december period  the company earned a higher rate of reimbursement and incurred lower operating costs in its vn operations than were earned and incurred  respectively  in the december and march periods 
costs of services  primarily labor and related costs  were reduced due to increased staff productivity and a reduction in the amount of unprofitable insurance and managed care cases 
these reductions were accomplished in large part due to substantial investments made in information systems software employed in the operation of the segment 
the company plans to continue its efforts to refine and improve the operating efficiencies of the segment 
the company generated more admissions in the nine months ended december  versus the nine months ended december  while patient months of care declined due to a shorter average length of stay 
bad debt expense approximated of revenues in all periods shown above based on historical collection results 
since medicare pps is still relatively new  this rate may differ in the future 
a medicare rate increase of went into effect october  a medicare rate decrease is scheduled to go into effect october  the company currently estimates that if such rate cut is enacted it would have the approximate effect of reversing on october   the rate increase that went into effect on october  however  the medicare program has not yet announced what the rates would actually be 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s estimate will prove accurate

prior to the sale of the product operations  the company was able to sustain this level of operating losses due to profits in the product segment on patients from the same referral and payment sources  which more than offset the vn losses 
specifically  medicare  private insurance and managed care business was profitable in the product operations and unprofitable in the vn segment 
after the sale of the product operations in november  the company took steps to significantly reduce the amount of private insurance managed care business and to completely redesign its operating structure to lower operating costs

health care reform the health care industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document 
proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures

legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact reimbursement 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
federal and state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as the company 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures

the department of health and human services must adopt standards for the following o electronic transactions and code sets  o unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals  o security and electronic signatures  o privacy  and o enforcement 
although hipaa was intended ultimately to reduce administrative expenses and burdens faced within the health care industry  the company believes the law will initially bring about significant and  in some cases  costly changes 
the department of health and human services has released two rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to certain health care transactions and health information 
the first rule establishes uniform standards for common health care transactions  including o health care claims information  o plan eligibility  referral certification and authorization  o claims status  o plan enrollment and disenrollment  o payment and remittance advice  o plan premium payments  and o coordination of benefits 
second  the department of health and human services has released standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
these standards not only require compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of protected health information  but they also require the company to impose those rules  by contract  on any business associate to whom we disclose protected information 
the department of health and human services has proposed rules governing the security of health information  but has not yet issued these rules in final form 
the department of health and human services finalized the electronic transaction standards on august  payors are required to comply with the transaction standards by october  or october   depending on the size of the payor and whether the payor requests a one year waiver 
following compliance by its payors  the company must comply with the transaction standards  to the extent it uses electronic data interchange 
the department of health and human services issued the privacy standards on december   and  after certain delays  they became effective on april   with a compliance date of april  once the department of health and human services has issued the security regulations in final form  affected parties will have approximately two years to be fully compliant 
sanctions for failing to comply with the hipaa provisions related to health information practices include criminal and civil penalties 
management is in the process of evaluating the effect of hipaa on the company 
at this time  management anticipates that the company will be able to fully comply with those hipaa requirements that have been adopted 
however  management cannot at this time estimate the cost of compliance  nor can it estimate the cost of compliance with standards that have not yet been finalized by the department of health and human services 
although the new and proposed health information standards are likely to have a significant effect on the manner in which the company handles health data and communicates with payors  based on current knowledge  the company believes that the cost of our compliance will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments the company does not use derivative instruments 
market risk of financial instruments the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately  in annual pre tax earnings from continuing operations
