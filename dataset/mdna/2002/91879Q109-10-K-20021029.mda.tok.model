lodging ebitda is defined as revenues from lodging operations plus lodging equity investment income less lodging operating expenses 
mountain ebitda and lodging ebitda are not terms that have an established meaning under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and they might not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

fiscal was highlighted by stronger than expected season pass sales  increased ticket prices  strong retail rental sales  lodging acquisitions  conscious discounting of room rates at the company s lodging properties near the company s ski resorts to attract incremental vacationers  soft visitation for group and corporate business stemming from the slow national economy and the events of september   close management of costs while continuing to provide a high quality guest experience  and a greater than expected decline in international guests 
despite below average ski season snowfall  the weak economy and nation wide declines in leisure travel  fiscal mountain revenue was strong 
mountain revenue including equity investment income increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily driven by lift ticket revenue and other mountain revenue 
increased ticket prices and strong season pass sales led to record lift ticket revenues for the ski season 
although skier visits for the year were down on a year over year basis  the decline is consistent with the declines in the colorado and national markets  which had overall skier visit declines of and  respectively  compared to fiscal lodging revenue including equity investment income growth was generated primarily by the million of revenue gained through the november and december acquisitions of rockresorts  rancho mirage and the vail marriott 
on a same store basis  lodging revenues declined year over year due to the recession  slow rebound in the general us travel industry following september  and the above mentioned room rate discounting during the ski season 
the company s real estate segment had an increase in revenue including equity investment income for fiscal as compared to fiscal generated by the success of the company s red sky ranch and arrowhead mountain developments 
the company believes that growth in revenue and ebitda can be achieved in both the mountain and lodging segments in fiscal  from the acquisitions made in fiscal as well as from same store growth 
the company also anticipates another strong year in real estate operations in fiscal  as the high end real estate sales market continues to hold its own

a significant portion of the administrative costs are allocated to the mountain segment and thereby impacted operating expense

in response to the securities and exchange commission s sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which the company s financial status depends 
the critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies identified relate to i revenue recognition  ii reserve estimates  iii intangible assets  iv income taxes and v real estate held for sale 
revenue recognition 
mountain and lodging revenues are derived from a wide variety of sources  including sales of lift tickets  ski snowboard school tuition  dining  retail stores  equipment rental  hotel operations  property management services  travel reservation services  private club dues and fees  real estate brokerage  conventions  golf course greens fees  licensing and sponsoring activities and other recreational activities  and are recognized as products are delivered or services are performed 
revenues from real estate sales are not recognized until title has been transferred  and revenue is deferred if the related receivable is subject to subordination until such time that all costs have been recovered 
until the initial down payment and subsequent collection of principal and interest are by contract substantial  cash received from the buyer is reported as a deposit on the contract 
revenues from club initiation fees are initially deferred and recognized over the expected life of the club facilities 
deferred revenue 
in addition to deferring certain revenues related to the real estate segment  the company records deferred revenue related to the sale of season ski passes  certain daily lift ticket products and private club initiation fees 
season pass revenue is recognized each time a season pass is used to access a ski resort based on a rate established using the total estimated visits of a season pass holder for the ski season 
during the ski season the estimated visits are compared to the actual visits and adjustments are made if necessary 
initiation fees are recognized over the expected life of the club facilities 
reserve estimates 
the company uses estimates to record reserves for certain liabilities  including medical claims and workers compensation for which the company is self insured  legal liabilities and liabilities for the completion of real estate sold by the company  among other items 
the company estimates the total potential costs related to these liabilities that will be incurred  and records that amount as a liability in its financial statements 
these estimates are reviewed and appropriately adjusted as the facts and circumstances related to the liabilities change 
intangible assets 
the company frequently obtains intangible assets  primarily through business combinations 
the assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires the use of specialist  such as an appraiser 
the assumptions used in the appraisal process are forward looking  and thus are subject to significant interpretation 
because individual intangible assets i may be expensed immediately upon acquisition  ii amortized over their estimated useful life  or iii not amortized  the assigned values could have a material effect on current and future period results of operations 
further  intangibles are subject to certain judgments when evaluating impairment pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  discussed more below 
income taxes 
the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process requires the company to estimate the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent recovery is not likely  must establish a valuation allowance 
as of july   the company had a net current deferred tax asset of million  which represented approximately of total assets 
the net deferred tax asset contains a valuation allowance representing the portion that management does not believe will be recovered from future taxable income 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be gene rated in the future to realize the benefit of the company s net deferred tax assets 
the company s assumptions of future profitable operations are supported by the company s strong operating performance over the last several years and the absence of factors that would indicate this trend would be unlikely to continue 
real estate held for sale 
the company capitalizes as land held for sale the original acquisition cost  direct construction and development costs  property taxes  interest incurred on costs related to land under development  and other related costs engineering  surveying  landscaping  etc 
until the property reaches its intended use 
the cost of sales for individual parcels of real estate or condominium units within a project is determined using the relative sales value method 
selling expenses are charged against income in the period incurred 
estimates to complete for units that have been sold are accrued at the date of sale based on management s best estimate of the remaining costs to be incurred 
new accounting pronouncements the company early adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of august  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  instead being subject to impairment tests at least annually

for the years ended july  and would have increased net income by million and million  respectively and increased earnings per share by in each year 
the first step of the two step impairment approach to testing goodwill involves a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment 
under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 the company completed the first step of its goodwill impairment testing by the end of its second fiscal quarter and the transitional impairment testing of its other intangible assets by the end of its first fiscal quarter of the company utilized discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of its reporting units 
as allowed under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 the company completed the second step in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  the company recorded a goodwill impairment loss associated with the village at breckenridge reporting unit of million  net of income taxes  in the first quarter of fiscal  which has been recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment is the result of the failure of the related reporting unit to meet the earnings expectations set by the company at the time the reporting unit was acquired

seasonality and quarterly results the company s mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenues and profits for the company s mountain and most of its lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses in the summer months 
conversely  gtlc s and certain managed properties peak operating seasons occur during the summer months while the winter season generally results in operating losses due to closure of all revenue generating operations 
however  revenues and profits generated by gtlc s summer operations and management fees from those managed properties are not sufficient to fully offset the company s off season losses from its mountain and lodging operations 
during the fiscal year  of total combined mountain and lodging revenues were earned during the second and third fiscal quarters 
quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of snowfall and the integration of acquisitions
