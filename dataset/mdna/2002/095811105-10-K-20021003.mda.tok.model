item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item business additional factors that may affect our business or future results  item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview blue rhino was founded in march we believe we have become the leading national provider of propane grill cylinder exchange and a leading provider of complementary propane and non propane products to consumers through many of the world s greatest retailers 
our branded propane grill cylinder exchange service is offered at more than  retail locations in states and puerto rico  including leading home improvement centers  mass merchants  hardware  grocery and convenience stores 
our retail partners include home depot  lowe s  wal mart  sears  kmart  kroger  food lion  winn dixie  superamerica  circle k and exxonmobil 
propane grill cylinder exchange provides consumers with a safe and convenient alternative to traditional propane tank refilling 
our cylinder exchange segment partners with retailers and distributors  which are currently independent  to provide consumers with a nationally branded alternative to traditional grill cylinder refill 
we dedicate our efforts and capital to brand development  value added marketing  customer service  cylinders  displays  account growth  distributor network development and management information systems 
our distributors invest in the vehicles and other operational infrastructure necessary to operate cylinder exchange businesses and we have agreed in principle on financial terms on which we would acquire nine of our key distributors 
we believe that our distributor network affords us the opportunity to service approximately of the cylinder exchange markets in the united states 
we currently offer three types of grill cylinder transactions i like for like cylinder exchanges  ii cylinder exchanges with valve upgrades offering additional safety features  and iii filled cylinder sales 
cylinder transactions accounted for of our net revenues in fiscal our products segment revenue grew significantly in fiscal to million from million in fiscal primarily due to a substantial increase in the number of grills sold and an increase in the number of patio heaters sold 
our products division is separately managed by uniflame s management team  which has extensive experience in the design and import of consumer products sold through mass retailers 
uniflame s revenues are derived from products that use propane cylinders as their fuel source  principally patio heaters and grills  and non propane products such as charcoal grills  fireplace accessories and garden products 
the majority of uniflame s sales occur in the fall and winter months  which is counterseasonal to the strongest months for our cylinder exchange segment 
quickship  inc  a retail shipping services company that we acquired in october  is included within the products segment as it is not currently significant on a stand alone basis note 
our revenues are influenced by a number of factors  including seasonality  consumer awareness  weather conditions  new propane appliance sales  promotional activities  advertising and those factors described above under business additional factors that may affect our business or future results 
we have strategically expanded our business to better diversify our revenue stream  balance our seasonality and offer and promote more products that use our core grill cylinder exchange service like barbecue grills and patio heaters 
our cost of sales for cylinder exchange is comprised of a contractually determined fixed base amount  along with a variable component based on the price of propane  which we pay to our distributors for each cylinder transaction 
our cost of sales for products is comprised of the wholesale cost of products sold 
development of the infrastructure necessary to support a nationwide branded products and service company has resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of july  this has resulted in net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes that are available to offset future taxable income  if any  in varying amounts from through  subject to certain limitations as prescribed by section of the internal revenue code 
based on our history of operating losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance to the full extent of our net deferred tax assets 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles of the united states of america gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  and revenue and expense amounts reported 
we believe our uses of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for further detail  see summary of significant accounting policies in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize i cylinder exchange revenues upon delivery of the cylinders to retailers by our distributors  ii products revenues upon shipment to retailers  and iii shipping services revenues at the time consumers ship packages at the in store retail depot 
we estimate returns and allowances against the revenues and record the estimated returns and allowances in the same period in which the revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical analysis  customer agreements and or currently known factors that arise in the normal course of business 
if the allowances we calculate do not accurately reflect returns associated with current revenue  actual revenues could be higher or lower than the level recognized 
effective february   we adopted the emerging issues task force s issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives  which addresses the recognition  measurement and income statement classification for certain sales incentives  including rebates  coupons and free products or services 
as provided in eitf no 
 certain cooperative advertising costs historically included by the company in selling  general and administrative expenses are now classified as reductions of net revenues 
prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the segment level based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
quantitative estimates are developed from accounts receivable agings based on expected losses 
qualitative estimates are based on evaluations of specific customer accounts in light of current economic conditions 
balances due from customers in bankruptcy are considered uncollectible 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgments and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
if the allowances we calculate do not accurately reflect losses associated with current receivables  actual losses could be higher or lower than the level recognized 
depreciation of propane cylinders  cylinder displays and proprietary valves 
we own cylinders and cylinder displays that we lease to our distributors under operating lease agreements notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cylinders are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of years 
our distributors are contractually obligated to refurbish cylinders into like new condition and reimburse us for any inventory shortages related to cylinders in the form of cash or like new cylinders 
this refurbishment cost is expensed as part of our cost of goods sold 
our displays are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of years and our proprietary valves are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of years 
we believe these estimates are reflective of the future usefulness of these assets to our operations 
in the event that future facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of cylinders  cylinder displays or proprietary valves may not be recoverable  estimated future undiscounted cash flows will be compared to the carrying value of the particular asset and  if less  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
intangible assets and goodwill impairment 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in the impact of new accounting pronouncements section of this report  we have significant intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves judgments and the use of estimates 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests and  in certain circumstances  more frequent impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
impairment tests are designed to review the recoverability of the carrying values of the intangible assets and require the use of judgments and assumptions 
the fair value of the intangible assets would be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
we cannot be sure that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a change in asset valuations and a charge to earnings 
derivative instruments 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we use derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations and wholesale propane price volatility 
in connection with these activities  we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which requires that all financial derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair values are based on listed market prices  when such prices are available 
to the extent that listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations  price quotations for similar instruments traded in different markets  and pricing models that consider current market conditions and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities 
changes in the interest rate and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting our results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship of certain items from our statements of operations to net revenues 
due to many factors  including the national fire protection association nfpa guidelines that require that all propane cylinders refilled after april  be fitted with an overfill prevention device  the diversification of our product offerings and our rapid sales growth  any trends reflected by the following table may not be indicative of future results 
net revenues operating costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating costs and expenses income from operations interest and other expenses income interest expense loss on investee nonrecurring items other  net income loss before income taxes and extraordinary loss income taxes income loss before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss  net net income loss preferred dividends net income loss available to common stockholders comparison of years ended july  and net revenues 
net revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal net revenues for fiscal consisted of million from cylinder transactions and million from product sales 
cylinder exchange revenues increased due primarily to an approximately increase in the number of cylinder transactions to million units in fiscal year from million units during fiscal  reflecting the positive trend toward consumer acceptance of cylinder exchange versus refill and the impact of the new nfpa guidelines requiring that all propane cylinders refilled after april  be fitted with an overfill prevention device opd 
approximately one third of the increase in cylinder exchange revenues was due to price increases to retailers  enabled by a higher mix of upgrade transactions  and approximately two thirds was due to an increase in the number of total cylinder transactions 
product revenues increased due principally to an increase in the number of grills sold and to a lesser degree an increase in the number of patio heaters sold 
we currently anticipate double digit revenue growth for both our cylinder exchange and products and other segments for fiscal year and we currently expect the new nfpa guidelines to continue to contribute to our cylinder exchange revenue growth through at least the end of fiscal gross margin 
our overall gross margin decreased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal gross margin percentage increased basis points in cylinder exchange to from in fiscal due primarily to price increases to retailers partially offset by a restructured payment plan to distributors to reflect their cost of installing opd valves 
we have implemented propane hedges and modified our distributor payment structure in a manner that we currently believe will continue to limit the exposure of our cylinder exchange gross margin to volatility in propane prices 
the products and other segment gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to a shift in sales mix to products that carry a lower margin 
for fiscal  we currently expect cylinder exchange margins to continue to be at least and product sales gross margins to continue to be between and 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal and  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues was due primarily to the fact that a significant portion of such expenses are fixed and increased at a slower rate than did net revenues 
sg a expenses in the cylinder exchange segment increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to increased personnel costs to support growth  additional costs associated with distributor operations and increased professional fees  partially offset by a decrease in marketing costs 
sg a expenses in the products and other segment increased to million from million in the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased personnel costs to support growth at uniflame and additional costs related to quickship  which had operating costs for the entire fiscal year compared to nine months in fiscal we currently expect selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal to continue to decrease as a percentage of net revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in amortization expense to  for fiscal from million for fiscal as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization due to the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense resulting from an increase in the number of cylinders held under operating lease agreements and from our acquisition  effective september   of machinery and equipment from r technical center north carolina  llc  the company s joint venture r tech 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to increased interest rates from our million of subordinated debt that we obtained on june  loss on investee 
loss on investee decreased to  for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to increased revenue and improved gross margins 
this charge represents our share of the loss related to our ownership interest in r tech 
we currently expect r tech to break even for fiscal and anticipate r tech s revenues and operating income to be highest in our third and fourth fiscal quarters  which include the majority of the grilling season  and lowest in our first and second fiscal quarters 
other  net 
other  net increased to approximately  for fiscal from approximately  for fiscal other income consists primarily of interest income from advances made to r tech and distributors 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes  which reflects current state income tax expense  decreased to  in fiscal from  for fiscal comparison of years ended july  and net revenues 
net revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal net revenues for fiscal consisted of million from cylinder transactions and million from product sales 
the increase in revenues was due primarily to a four fold increase in product sales reflecting an additional eight months of sales by uniflame in fiscal  as uniflame was acquired in april cylinder revenues increased primarily due to an approximately increase in same store sales  the maturity and increased consumer awareness of cylinder exchange locations selling less than one year and an increase in the prices charged to retailers 
the number of cylinder transactions increased to approximately million units during fiscal from approximately million units during fiscal gross margin 
our overall gross margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the increase in product segment sales as a percentage of net revenues 
product sales carry a lower gross margin than do cylinder transactions 
gross margin was also negatively affected in fiscal by increased payments to distributors that we made voluntarily from march through february to help offset an increase in wholesale propane prices 
on march   we changed the method in which we pay our distributors and implemented a propane hedging strategy 
these measures  combined with price increases to retailers  began to favorably impact cylinder exchange gross margins during the third quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  gross margins on cylinder transactions returned to historical levels in excess of 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to overhead costs resulting from the uniflame and quickship acquisitions being included in operations in fiscal and to increased marketing and administrative costs to support the growth in the cylinder exchange business 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was due primarily to the fact that a significant portion of such expenses are fixed and increased at a slower rate than did net revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal depreciation expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to the increase in the number of installed cylinder displays and the increase in the number of cylinders held under operating lease agreements 
the increase in cylinders and cylinder displays was necessary to support the growth in our installed base of retail locations 
amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal amortization increased principally due to the amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the additional borrowings outstanding under our credit facility combined with an increase in interest rates on the credit facility and interest expense on subordinated debt and related warrants 
the additional borrowings were used primarily to fund operations  to purchase cylinders and cylinder displays leased to our distributors and to fund business acquisitions and our investment in and advances to r tech  the operator of the automated propane bottling and cylinder refurbishing plant 
other  net 
other  net increased to income of approximately  for fiscal from a loss of approximately  for fiscal the increase was primarily a result of additional interest income from advances to r tech and distributors 
loss on investee 
loss on investee increased to million for fiscal from  for fiscal this charge represents our share of the loss related to our ownership interest in r tech  which began operations in may r tech is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in revenues and net income loss 
nonrecurring items 
there was a nonrecurring loss of approximately  in fiscal from costs incurred in connection with refinancing our bank credit facility 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes  which reflects current state income tax expense  increased to  in fiscal from  for fiscal extraordinary loss 
the extraordinary loss of  in fiscal consisted of the unamortized debt discount and other debt issuance costs that were recognized due to the early retirement of convertible notes in july liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds have been the incurrence of debt  the issuance of stock and cash flow from operations 
the primary sources of cash for fiscal were cash provided by operations and  to a lesser extent  cash provided by the issuance of stock 
cash provided by operations was used to pay down existing debt in fiscal  resulting in a million decrease in working capital from fiscal to the primary sources of cash for fiscal and were cash provided by the issuance of stock and the proceeds from debt and  to a lesser extent  cash provided by operations 
net cash generated by operating activities was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operations for fiscal over fiscal and was primarily due to the increase in net income and  to a lesser extent  the decrease in working capital needs due to improved management of accounts receivable and accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the primary components of cash used in investing activities in all periods included purchases of cylinders leased to our distributors  investments in property  plant and equipment and advances to r tech 
for fiscal  the primary components of cash used in investing activities included acquisitions and our net investment in  and advances to  r tech 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal while net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal cash used in financing activities for fiscal included net payments on our credit facility and payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock in a private placement 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal included million in subordinated debt and net proceeds of million from a preferred stock private placement partially offset by net payments on our credit facility 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal included net proceeds on our credit facility  million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock and million in proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt

uniflame corporation leases its facility from h m enterprises  llc  a company affiliated with mac mcquilkin  the president of uniflame 
the lease terminates on march  uniflame s rent expense for the years ended july   and was  and  respectively 
on april   we entered into a joint venture agreement to operate and manage the automated propane bottling and cylinder refurbishing plant in north carolina then owned by r tech  which began operations in may we received a ownership interest in the joint venture in exchange for our net contribution of approximately million 
the joint venture is being accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
effective september   we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction with r tech 
we purchased all of the land  buildings and equipment associated with the propane bottling and cylinder refurbishing operation for million 
the purchase price was used by r tech to repay our outstanding advances 
contemporaneously with the sale  r tech leased back the land  buildings and equipment from us under the terms of a three year operating lease agreement 
during fiscal years and  we provided net advances of million and million  respectively  to r tech 
at july   we had advances outstanding of approximately  to r tech and payables to r tech of million 
on september   we completed a private placement of  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock to two institutional investors under common management and three individuals  including billy prim and andrew filipowski  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
messrs 
prim and filipowski invested  and  for  and  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  respectively 
in connection with this issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock we paid william blair co 
a placement fee of  in cash and issued a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the series a convertible preferred stock accrued a cumulative dividend on the th day of december  march  june  and september of each year based on an annual rate of through september   from september  through september   and thereafter 
effective september   the annual dividend rate increased to because a registration statement covering the shares of common stock into which the series a convertible preferred stock was convertible was not yet effective 
the rate continued until the registration statement became effective on april  as of july  and  we had accrued dividends on the outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock of million and  respectively 
during march  april and may  the holder of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock voluntarily converted such shares into  shares of common stock 
effective september   as permitted by our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  we converted the remaining  outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock into  shares of common stock 
prior to the respective conversions  the shares of series a convertible preferred stock accrued a cumulative dividend that we satisfied  as permitted by the terms of the series a convertible preferred stock  by issuing an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock upon conversion 
on october   we completed the acquisition of quickship  inc  a retail shipping service company and our wholly owned subsidiary 
quickship  which currently offers its service at over retail locations in states  provides consumers with a convenient  full service  in store postal and parcel shipping depot and provides retailers with an additional revenue source 
the aggregate purchase price  including certain acquisition costs  was approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash and deferred payments   in a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share  million in liabilities assumed and million paid in the form of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock valued at per share 
we currently project quickship to be dilutive to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda by approximately  in fiscal and to be further dilutive to earnings as a result of expected depreciation and amortization expense 
in july  we amended and extended our existing bank credit facility as amended  the credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a million revolving line of credit for general corporate purposes  inclusive of payments made under letters of credit issued for the benefit of the company  and has a maturity date of august  the credit facility stipulates that the amount of the revolving line of credit will decrease to million on january  and to million on may  the credit facility includes a 
fee on the average daily unused amount for each fiscal quarter 
according to the terms of the credit facility  unless we have satisfied the entire outstanding indebtedness by the corresponding date  we are required to pay the bank a  fee on december   a  fee on march   a  fee on june   and a  fee on september  and each successive quarter thereafter 
the credit facility requires us to meet certain covenants  including minimum net worth and cash flow requirements  is collateralized by a lien on substantially all of our assets and permits early extinguishment of our million in subordinated debt 
the credit facility bears interest at the thirty day london interbank offered rate libor plus per annum and  at july   the interest rate was 
at july   the balance on the credit facility was million  and we were in compliance with all covenants 
in conjunction with the amendment and extension of the credit facility  we entered into a syndication agreement with bank of america intended to replace the credit facility with an expanded three year syndicated facility of million  which we currently expect to close in our fiscal second quarter ending january  we are a party to an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million as a partial hedge of our variable interest rate debt 
the purpose of the swap is to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
under the swap agreement  which expires in july  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a rate equivalent to the thirty day libor  adjusted quarterly 
on june   we completed a million private placement of subordinated debt to an institutional investor 
the agreement requires us to meet certain cash flow and other covenants and contains restrictions on capital expenditures and the payment of cash dividends 
at july   we were in compliance with all covenants 
the debenture bears interest at the annual rate of  payable quarterly 
the principal balance matures on august  in conjunction with the subordinated debt  we issued a warrant to the investor to purchase  shares of common stock  with an exercise price of per share subject to adjustment for organic changes in our common stock and for certain future issuances below the then existing exercise price 
the warrant can be exercised at the holder s discretion in whole or in part any time until the later of june  or five years after payment of all amounts due under the debenture 
on april   we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock for million in a private placement through suntrust robinson humphrey capital markets  as placement agent  to selected institutional and individual investors at a price of per share 
the net proceeds from the financing were used to pay down the credit facility 
we do not have any material capital commitments outstanding 
we currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding acquisitions  will be approximately million  and will relate primarily to cylinders  cylinder displays and computer technology 
our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future will change depending on many factors including  but not limited to  the rate of our expansion  our operating results and any other adjustments in our operating plan needed in response to competition  acquisition opportunities or unexpected events 
we believe that our existing borrowing capacity under the credit facility or the proposed replacement syndicated facility  together with cash provided by operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements through fiscal however  if we are unable to close the proposed replacement syndicated facility or if we experience an unexpected decrease in demand for our cylinder exchange service or our products  we may need additional funds to meet our capital requirements 
in that event  or if we perceive conditions to be favorable  we may seek additional debt or equity financing 
we cannot be sure that any additional equity or debt financing will be available on favorable terms or on terms that are not dilutive to our stockholders 
seasonality we have experienced and currently expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating income 
our revenues and operating income have been highest in the spring and summer  which includes the majority of the grilling season  and lowest in the fall and winter 
our cylinder exchange segment  which generally enjoys higher margins than our products and other segment  experiences higher revenues and operating income in the spring and summer 
conversely  our products and other segment experiences higher revenues and operating income in the fall and winter 
sustained periods of poor weather  particularly in the spring and summer  can negatively impact our revenues 
accordingly  the results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our revenues  cost of sales or our results of operations 
we cannot be sure that our business will not be materially affected by inflation in the future 
price of propane during the fiscal year ended july   there were dramatic increases in fuel costs and propane reached unusually high levels 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing through the fourth quarter of fiscal  propane prices returned to a range more consistent with historical levels 
on march   we initiated a propane price hedging strategy that has reduced  and we believe will continue to reduce  our gross margin risk resulting from fluctuations in the price of propane 
our strategy is designed to reduce exposure to the fuel cost component of a significant portion of our total cylinder exchange volume 
if propane costs rise for an extended period and our hedging strategy is unsuccessful  our gross margins and results of operations could be negatively affected due to additional costs that may not be fully recovered through an increase in our price to retailers 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any transactions  obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year application of the nonamortization provisions of the statements resulted in an increase in net income of approximately million in fiscal at july   we had unamortized intangibles of million that were subject to the transition provisions of the statements 
we did not recognize any impairment of goodwill upon adoption of sfas we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and  in certain circumstances  more frequently 
we cannot be sure that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
effective february   we adopted the emerging issues task force s issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives  which addresses the recognition  measurement and income statement classification for certain sales incentives  including rebates  coupons and free products or services 
as provided in eitf no 
 certain cooperative advertising costs that we historically included in selling  general and administrative expenses are now classified as reductions of net revenues 
prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as required by sfas no 
 we will adopt this new accounting standard for fiscal year we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement eliminates an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions and establishes that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of extraordinary 
we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
we will adopt this standard by the required december deadline 
we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility 
the credit facility bears interest based on libor and is collateralized by cylinders held under operating leases with our independent distributors 
the operating leases currently yield of the cylinder value monthly approximately annually and continue until either party terminates upon days written notice to the other party 
upon any significant increase in libor  we would attempt to renegotiate the operating leases with our independent distributors with the intent of mitigating our interest rate exposure on the credit facility 
however  we cannot be sure that we would be successful in such renegotiations or that we would be able to mitigate any or all of the interest rate risk 
to quantify our exposure to interest rate risk  a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense for the year ended july  and by approximately  and  respectively 
actual changes in interest rates may differ materially from the hypothetical assumptions used in computing this exposure 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our credit facility 
these derivative financial instruments  which are generally swap agreements  are not entered into for trading purposes 
a swap agreement is a contract to exchange a floating rate for a fixed rate without the exchange of the underlying notional amount 
in fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million as a hedge of our variable interest rate debt represented by the credit facility 
under the swap agreement  which expires in july  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a rate equivalent to the thirty day libor  adjusted quarterly 
in july  the interest rate on the credit facility was changed to a rate based on the thirty day libor  adjusted monthly 
at july   the interest rate swap was an effective cash flow hedge 
we are exposed to commodity price risk related to changes in the price of propane 
if propane prices rise for an extended period  our gross margins and results of operations could be negatively affected due to additional costs that may not be fully recovered through an increase in our price to our customers 
assuming that propane prices are not hedged and any increase cannot be recovered through an increase in our price  a 
increase in the price per gallon of propane would reduce the gross margin in our cylinder exchange segment by approximately 
or basis points 
actual changes in margins may differ materially from the hypothetical assumptions used in computing this exposure 
we have restructured our payment obligations to distributors and entered into a series of monthly option contracts that are designed to reduce exposure to the propane cost component of a significant portion of our total cylinder exchange volume 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  highly liquid investments consisting of money market instruments  bank certificates of deposit and overnight investments in commercial paper 
all of our transactions are conducted and accounts are denominated in us dollars and as such we do not currently have exposure to foreign currency risk
