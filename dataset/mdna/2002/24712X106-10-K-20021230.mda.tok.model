item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and adjustments  including those related to inventory  income taxes  revenue recognition and restructuring initiatives 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory the company reduces the stated value of its inventory for obsolescence or impairment in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional reductions in stated value may be required 
conversely  if actual future demand or market conditions are more favorable than those projected by management  reserves in excess of those estimated to be required in the future may be released 
income taxes in determining the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets  the company must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  to realize the benefit of these assets 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company fully reserved its net deferred tax assets totaling  recognizing that the company has incurred losses in three of the last four fiscal years and there is no assurance that future years will be profitable 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may record a reduction in the valuation allowance  resulting in an income tax benefit in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the valuation allowance quarterly 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when systems are shipped or services are rendered 
for spare parts  supplies and consumable items stored at customer sites  revenue is recognized when the inventory is used by the customer 
amounts billed to customers under maintenance contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized in income over the term of the maintenance agreement 
customer billings in advance of system shipment are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized upon shipment of the system 
revenue on the company s ps micr systems product line  manufactured by oc and private labeled by the company  is recorded on a gross basis 
freight revenue is recorded on a gross basis and recognized upon shipment 
the related freight costs are recorded as a cost of sales 
restructuring initiatives in april  the company effected a workforce reduction  eliminating approximately positions in the canadian subsidiary 
see note e of the consolidated financial statements 
as of september   the accrued liability for benefits payable in the future was  it is estimated that this balance will be sufficient to cover the remaining obligation under the workforce reduction plan 
in addition  subsequent to fiscal yearend  the company announced plans to consolidate its north american manufacturing and engineering operations at its canadian subsidiary 
see note k of the consolidated financial statements 
currently  these operations are divided between the facilities in the united states and canada 
the company s worldwide headquarters and marketing function will continue to be based in the united states 
the selling and customer service functions will remain unchanged in the united states  as well as in the subsidiaries in the united kingdom and france 
the company expects to incur approximately million in restructuring expenses over the course of the consolidation  which is scheduled to be completed by the end of calendar these restructuring expenses are wholly comprised of employee severance costs unrelated to the acquisition of the canadian subsidiary and  therefore  will be properly charged to operating expense in fiscal at the end of each quarter  management evaluates its estimates of costs to complete the restructuring initiatives 
differences  if any  between previous and revised cost estimates many result in a charge or credit to the company s results of operations 

table of contents results of operations the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal include the post acquisition results of the business acquired by the company on december  see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table sets forth the company s statements of operations as a percentage of net sales and should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this report 
year ended september  sales printing equipment maintenance  spares and supplies net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative research and development loss income from system sales and service interest expense interest income realized exchange gain loss unrealized exchange gain loss loss income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss income the company s revenues are from sales of i document production systems and related equipment  and ii maintenance contracts  spare parts  supplies and consumable items 
for the year ended september  fiscal  sales of document production equipment decreased over the year ended september  fiscal  compared with an increase of in fiscal over the year ended september  fiscal 
the decrease in fiscal compared with fiscal and the increase in fiscal compared with fiscal were primarily due to significantly higher imaggia sales in fiscal than in both fiscal and the company sold imaggia systems in fiscal  compared with in fiscal  and in fiscal the company attributes lower document production systems sales in fiscal compared with to uncertain economic conditions  which led customers to postpone capital equipment purchases 
with the acquisition of the canadian subsidiary in december  the company expanded its product lines to include the cr series and the rs series of roll fed print systems 
in june  the company reached an agreement with lexisnexis matthew bender for the establishment of the first major reference site for the delphax high speed cr series publishing system 
this installation  which currently includes two crp roll fed digital publishing systems capable of producing pages per minute  is significant in that it represents the company s initial step into the publishing market 

table of contents for some time  the company has held a dominant position in many of the international markets in which its checktronic equipment is sold 
demand for the checktronic system product line has softened in these international markets and revenues from this product line are now largely dependent on sales of system upgrades and refurbished checktronics  rather than new checktronics  to emerging markets such as latin america  asia and africa 
the present uncertain economic environment in many of the countries within these emerging markets has limited the company s current opportunities to sell high end capital equipment into those regions 
combined sales of all other product lines  including the checktronic  were flat in fiscal  compared with fiscal and fiscal revenues from maintenance contracts  spare parts  supplies and consumable items increased in fiscal over fiscal  compared with a increase in fiscal over fiscal the significant increase in fiscal  compared with  was due primarily to incremental revenues from the fiscal acquisition of the canadian subsidiary  which contributed million of the million total increase in revenues from maintenance contracts  spare parts  supplies and consumable items 
the other million increase in fiscal over fiscal and the million increase in fiscal over fiscal were primarily due to the significant increases in the installed base of imaggia systems year to year 
the company expects revenues from maintenance contracts  spare parts  supplies and consumable items to increase in fiscal consistent with expected additions to the installed base  and to include the effect of owning the canadian subsidiary for the full fiscal the company s gross margin percentage in fiscal was  compared with and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in gross margin percentage for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to the increase in revenues from maintenance contracts  spares parts  supplies and consumable items generated by the canadian acquisition 
the decrease in gross margin percentage for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to the shift in the product mix from the checktronic system product line to the imaggia system product line  coupled with lower margins on the increased level of service revenues 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a non recurring supplier price adjustment  which for the quarter added approximately points to gross margin 
the company anticipates that its gross margin percentage in fiscal will be somewhat higher than in fiscal due to programs in place to improve margins on revenues from maintenance contracts  spare parts  supplies and consumable items  which are expected to comprise a larger portion of total revenues in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal  compared with fiscal  and were million higher in fiscal than in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses were for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal increased expense levels in fiscal compared with fiscal were due to the acquisition of the canadian subsidiary and an increase in employees  principally in customer service  to support the larger installed base 
similarly  for fiscal compared with fiscal  higher expense levels  though a smaller percentage of net sales  were due to the increase in employees and associated expenses required to support the increase in total revenues 
for fiscal  approximately million of the total increase was due to expansion of the field force supporting the higher installed base of the imaggia system 
the company anticipates that its selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal may continue to increase to support the projected growth in total revenues  but at a rate less than the projected total revenue rate of growth 
research and development expenses increased significantly  to million in fiscal  from million in  and increased as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of the canadian subsidiary in fiscal research and development expenses in fiscal were only slightly lower  compared with fiscal  and decreased year to year as a percentage of net sales 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in fiscal interest expense in fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal  due to the company borrowing to finance the acquisition of the canadian subsidiary and  to a lesser extent  to fund increases in inventory in fiscal net interest expense was  in fiscal  compared with net interest income of  in fiscal the significant shift to a net interest expense position in fiscal was due to current fiscal year borrowing against the bank credit facility to fund operating activities in fiscal  which was not necessary in fiscal the company incurs realized and unrealized transactional foreign exchange gains and losses on currency conversion transactions that are reflected on the company s statements of operations 
realized and unrealized transactional exchange gains and losses reflect actual and anticipated  respectively  gains or losses recognized as the result of transactions between entities with different functional currencies 
the net transactional exchange gain for fiscal year was  the net transactional exchange losses for fiscal years and were  and  respectively 
the company experiences translational foreign currency gains and losses  which are reflected on the company s statements of shareholder s equity  with gains due to the weakening  and losses due to the strengthening  of the us dollar against the currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries and the resulting effect of currency translation on the valuation of the intercompany accounts and certain assets of the subsidiaries  which are denominated in us dollars 
the company anticipates that it will continue to have transactional and translational foreign exchange gains or losses from foreign operations in the future  although strategies to reduce the size of the gains or losses will be reviewed and implemented whenever economical and practical 

table of contents the company recorded an income tax expense of million on a loss before income taxes of million 
the income tax expense for fiscal reflects the estimated annual effective tax rate of and an increase in the valuation allowance to fully reserve the net deferred tax assets 
the company fully reserved its net deferred tax assets totaling  recognizing that the company has incurred losses in three of the last four fiscal years and there is no assurance that future years will be profitable 
the company recorded an income tax expense of in fiscal  compared with an income tax benefit of in fiscal the income tax expense for fiscal compared with fiscal changed as a percentage primarily because the company generated pre tax earnings in fiscal and incurred pre tax losses in fiscal net loss for fiscal was per share  compared with net income of per share for fiscal and net loss of per share for fiscal the net loss for fiscal  compared with net income for fiscal  was due to significantly lower equipment sales and significantly higher expense levels primarily due to the acquisition of the canadian subsidiary  only partially offset by the significantly higher revenues from maintenance contracts  spare parts  supplies and consumable items  also primarily due to the canadian acquisition 
the fiscal net loss was exacerbated by the fiscal income tax expense due to the company recording a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
the company was profitable in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due to the increase in document production systems revenues and lower foreign exchange losses  offset by the effect of reduced gross margins  increased selling  general and administrative expenses and fiscal interest expense versus fiscal interest income 
in fiscal  the company determined that the market served by its australian subsidiary could be served more profitably by alternative means  including independent distributors and sales agents  developed a formal exit plan to cease operations of the subsidiary as of september  and recorded a one time charge to  by closing the subsidiary  the company anticipated eliminating annual operating expenses of approximately  beginning in fiscal  with no further loss of revenues from pacific rim customers as a result of this change 
operations ceased as of december  on december   the company announced plans to consolidate its north american manufacturing and engineering operations at its canadian subsidiary 
currently  these operations are divided between the facilities in the united states and canada 
the company s worldwide headquarters and marketing function will continue to be based in the united states 
the selling and customer service functions will remain unchanged in the united states  as well as in the subsidiaries in the united kingdom and france 
the company expects to incur approximately million in restructuring expenses over the course of the consolidation  which is scheduled to be completed by the end of calendar these restructuring expenses are wholly comprised of employee severance costs unrelated to the acquisition of the canadian subsidiary and  therefore  will be properly charged to operating expense in fiscal this action is expected to eliminate annual operating expenses of million while improving the company s ability to provide customer service and fulfill current and future orders 
the cost savings could have an impact on operating results as early as the company s fiscal third quarter ending june  market risk the company has foreign subsidiaries in canada  the united kingdom and france 
the company does business in more than countries and generates approximately of its revenues from outside north america 
the company s ability to sell its products in these foreign markets may be affected by changes in economic  political or market conditions in the foreign markets in which it does business 
the company s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries was million and million at september  and  respectively  translated into us dollars at the closing exchange rates 
the potential loss based on end of period balances and prevailing exchange rates resulting from a hypothetical strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies was not material in the fiscal year ended september  the functional currency of the canadian subsidiary is the us dollar 

table of contents from time to time  the company has entered into foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against specific foreign currency receivables 
in fiscal and  the company did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts and does not currently anticipate entering into any such contracts 
interest rate risk substantially all of the company s debt and the associated interest expense are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in incremental interest expense in fiscal and fiscal of approximately  and  respectively 
factors affecting results of operations the company s revenues are subject to fluctuations  which may be material 
the company s net sales and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter because i the company s sales cycle is relatively long  ii the size of orders may vary significantly  iii the availability of financing for customers in some countries is variable  iv customers may postpone or cancel orders  and v economic  political and market conditions in some markets change with minimal notice and affect the timing and size of orders 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s operating costs are relatively fixed  variations in the timing of revenue recognition will result in significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period 
on december   the company acquired substantially all of the north american business assets of delphax systems  which is located in suburban toronto  ontario and is engaged in the development  manufacture and distribution of print engines  print management software and a range of digital printing systems incorporating proprietary ebi technology 
it is the supplier of the print engines used in a number of the company s products 
for fiscal  the acquisition contributed approximately million in incremental revenues 
while the company expects the acquisition to provide increased revenues and incremental operating income in the future  there is no assurance that actual results will be as anticipated 
in addition  the acquisition expanded the company s product lines to include the cr series and rs series of roll fed print systems 
in june  the company reached an agreement with lexisnexis matthew bender for the establishment of the first major reference site for the delphax high speed cr series publishing system 
to date  a limited number of cr series systems and only one rs series system have been sold and there can be no assurance that such systems will be sold in the future 
in january  the company entered into a three year equipment and service contract with a significant customer 
equipment deliveries under the contract began in the second quarter of fiscal and concluded in the third quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company executed a new equipment and service contract with this customer 
equipment deliveries under the most recent contract concluded in the second quarter of fiscal revenues from this customer have been significant  representing  and of total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that revenues from this customer will also be significant in fiscal  but to a lesser extent than in fiscal the company s ps micr systems product line is marketed under an agreement with oc printing systems gmbh for the right to private label  sell and service the ps micr product and other high performance sheet fed micr and non micr printing systems manufactured by oc 
the company agreed to purchase a minimum number of ps micr units from oc to maintain the exclusive right to sell the ps micr product 
the company purchased less than the minimum  and as a result  the company incurred a penalty and forfeited certain rights of exclusivity 
the company plans to continue offering the ps micr systems for sale  but there is no assurance that significant sales will be made 
as discussed below under the heading liquidity and capital resources  the company is dependent on its bank credit facility to fund its operations 
that facility currently matures on december  the company s ability to maintain working capital depends on its compliance with the amended credit facility and on being able to extend or replace that facility when it matures 
the company believes it has the ability to secure alternative forms of financing to meet its working capital requirements 
however  the pricing of these alternative forms of financing may not be as favorable as the current credit facility

the company s inventory levels increased to million at september   from million at september  inventory acquired from acquisition of the canadian subsidiary comprised approximately million of the increase 
accounts receivable increased to million at september   from million at september   with approximately million of the increase due to the canadian acquisition  offset by collection of receivables and lower fiscal equipment sales 
cash and short term investments amounted to million at september   compared with  at september  the increase in cash and short term investments was primarily due to the timing of borrowing and repaying amounts under the company s credit facility 
deferred revenue was  at september   compared with million at september  this decrease was principally due to completion of deliveries under the equipment portion of the contract with the significant customer that is described above and the recognition of the related deferred revenue 
as of september   deferred revenue was comprised primarily of unearned maintenance contract revenues 
the company has undertaken no significant investing activities 
no significant capital investment has been undertaken or is planned  and at september   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures

to finance the acquisition of the canadian subsidiary on december   the company entered into a bank credit agreement  secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
the credit agreement provides two types of loans  term and revolving  including letters of credit 
the term loan portion of the credit facility was advanced as a single borrowing on december   in the amount of million  million of which remained outstanding as of september  no amount repaid or prepaid on any term loan may be borrowed again

the company believes  but cannot assure  that it will be able to fully meet the terms of the amended credit agreement 
the company s ability to fund its future working capital requirements beyond december  is dependent upon its ability to extend or renegotiate financing at the end of that current term of the facility 
the company believes it has the ability to secure alternative forms of financing to meet its working capital requirements 
however  the pricing of these alternative forms of financing may not be as favorable as the current credit facility
