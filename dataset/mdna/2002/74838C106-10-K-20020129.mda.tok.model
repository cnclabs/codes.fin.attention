results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal of those totals  domestic net sales increased to  from  and quiksilver europe s net sales increased to  from  domestic net sales in the men s category  which includes quiksilver young men s  boys  toddlers  wintersports  quiksilveredition  and hawk clothing  increased to  for fiscal from  the year before 
domestic women s net sales  including roxy  roxy girl  teenie wahine  raisins  leilani and radio fiji  increased to  from  for those same periods 
wintersports hardgoods are sold under the lib technologies  gnu  supernatural manufacturing and bent metal brands and totaled  in fiscal compared to  in the previous year 
sales in the domestic men s category increased generally across all divisions  more than offsetting a slight decline in the young men s division that occurred in the last months of the company s fiscal year 
the women s increase came from both the roxy and raisins divisions 
the company believes that its product design and marketing efforts are resulting in increased consumer demand for the company s products 
quiksilver europe s net sales were approximately of the consolidated total in fiscal revenue growth was the largest in france  the united kingdom and spain 
in us dollars  net sales in the men s category increased to  for fiscal from  in the previous year 
women s net sales increased to  from  for those same periods 
to understand quiksilver europe s fiscal growth  it s important to look at sales in french francs or euros  which is the currency that quiksilver europe operates in 
competitive performance and market share gains are best measured in the operating currency 
for consolidated financial statement reporting  french franc or euro results must be translated into us dollar amounts at average exchange rates 
but this can distort performance when exchange rates change from year to year 
in french francs or euros  net sales grew in fiscal this is higher than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth more french francs or euros in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit the consolidated gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to from in the previous year 
the domestic gross profit margin decreased to from  while quiksilver europe s gross profit margin decreased slightly to from 
the domestic gross profit margin decreased primarily as a result of a  writedown in the carrying value of the company s inventory 
this writedown was required primarily as a result of the aftermath of september   when the market for consumer products  including casual lifestyle apparel  experienced a dramatic falloff in demand and resulted in a substantial amount of customer order cancellations 
this phenomenon created an industry wide glut of excess product available to the traditional off price channel thereby driving the price of certain seasonal product below cost 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a increased in fiscal to  from  in the previous year 
domestic sg a increased to  from  and quiksilver europe s sg a increased to  from  in those same periods 
higher personnel costs and other costs related to increased sales volume were the primary reasons for these increases 
as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to in fiscal from in fiscal sg a increased as a percentage of sales primarily due to the incremental operating costs of new company owned retail stores and to the operating costs of quiksilver international  which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal royalty income and expense in july  the company acquired quiksilver international  the owner of the quiksilver trademarks in all countries except the us and mexico 
historically  the company paid royalties to quiksilver international on sales in europe  canada  asia and various countries in central and south america 
as a result of this acquisition  however  royalty expense on sales of quiksilver products has been eliminated 
in terms of royalty income  the company has historically received royalties from its watch  sunglass  mexican and outlet store licensees 
again  as a result of the quiksilver international acquisition  the company now also receives royalties from various quiksilver licensees around the world 
these licensees do business in many countries and territories around the world  with headquarters in australia  japan  turkey  south africa  brazil  indonesia  south korea  argentina  chile and mauritius 
as a result  royalty income totaled  in fiscal  reflecting ownership of quiksilver international for the full fiscal year 
in fiscal  royalty income of  was almost entirely offset by royalty expense of interest expense and income taxes interest expense in fiscal increased to  from  in the previous year 
of that increase  approximately  was related to debt resulting from the quiksilver international acquisition 
the rest of the increase came primarily from additional borrowings to provide working capital to support the company s growth and to continued investments in retail stores 
the company s income tax rate for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal this reduction resulted primarily because a higher percentage of the company s profits were generated in countries with lower tax rates 
net income net income in fiscal totaled  or per share on a diluted basis 
in the previous year  net income was  or per share on a diluted basis 
basic earnings per share amounted to for fiscal compared to for fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal of those totals  domestic net sales increased to  from  and quiksilver europe s net sales increased to  from  domestic net sales in the men s category increased to  for fiscal from  the year before 
domestic women s net sales increased to  from  for those same periods 
wintersports hardgoods sales totaled  in fiscal  up from the previous year s amount of  all divisions in the domestic men s and women s categories contributed to the increase 
the company continued to benefit from increased consumer demand for its products 
the company believes that this increased demand came primarily from the company s product design and marketing efforts 
quiksilver europe s net sales also increased across all divisions and accounted for approximately of the consolidated total 
revenue growth was the largest in france  spain and the united kingdom 
in us dollars  net sales in the men s category increased to  for fiscal from  in the previous year 
women s net sales increased to  from  for those same periods 
in french francs  net sales grew in fiscal this is much higher than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth more french francs in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit the consolidated gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to from in the previous year 
the domestic gross profit margin decreased to from  while quiksilver europe s gross profit margin decreased to from 
the domestic off price market had excess product from other major brands at the end of fiscal  creating a buyer s market 
this condition  along with a higher level of prior season wintersports apparel sales in the third quarter  resulted in the lower domestic gross margin 
foreign currency exchange rates were the primary reason for the gross margin decline in europe 
quiksilver europe buys a large part of its product in us dollars  and when the us dollar significantly strengthened in the latter part of fiscal  product costs in french francs increased 
because the company was both unwilling and unable to completely pass these higher costs along to consumers  gross margins decreased 
hedging strategies did not completely offset the effect of the stronger us dollar in this period of rapid movement in exchange rates between the us dollar and the french franc  or euro 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a increased in fiscal to  from  in the previous year 
domestic sg a increased to  from  and quiksilver europe s sg a increased to  from  in those same periods 
higher personnel costs and other costs related to increased sales volume were the primary reasons for these increases 
as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal royalty income and expense royalty income exceeded royalty expense in fiscal by  the opposite was true in the previous year when royalty expense exceeded royalty income by  this improvement resulted from the quiksilver international acquisition 
the benefit of this improved royalty stream is offset  in part  by added sg a to operate quiksilver international s licensing business and the interest costs associated with the acquisition 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense in fiscal increased overall to  from  in the previous year 
debt related to the quiksilver international acquisition added approximately  of interest expense in fiscal the rest of the increase came primarily from additional borrowings to provide working capital to support the company s growth  and to continued investments in retail stores and computer equipment 
the company s income tax rate for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal lower income tax rates in europe were the primary reasons for this benefit 
in particular  the statutory tax rate in france was decreased during fiscal  and quiksilver europe generated more profits in countries with lower income tax rates 
net income net income in fiscal increased to  or per share on a diluted basis 
in the previous year  net income was  or per share on a diluted basis 
basic earnings per share was for fiscal compared to for fiscal financial position  capital resources and liquidity the company finances its working capital needs and capital investments with operating cash flows and its bank revolving lines of credit 
these lines of credit are made available by multiple banks in the us and in europe 
term loans are also used to supplement these lines of credit and are typically used to finance long term assets 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  at october  versus  at october  working capital amounted to  at october   compared to  an increase of 
the company s strategy is to keep cash balances low thereby keeping its lines of credit balances low while maintaining adequate liquidity in its credit facilities 
the company believes that its current cash flows and credit facilities are adequate to cover the company s cash needs for the foreseeable future 
the company further believes that increases in its credit facilities can be obtained as needed to fund future growth 
operating cash flows the company generated  from operations during fiscal compared to cash used in operations of  in fiscal the amount of net income plus noncash expenses was comparable in fiscal and fiscal and although cash invested in inventories exceeded the prior year by  net of accounts payable decrease  the increase in trade accounts receivable was  less in fiscal these factors resulted in a  improvement in operating cash flows 
operations used cash in fiscal primarily due to the increase in cash invested in inventories during that year in comparison to fiscal overall  cash used in operating activities totaled  in fiscal versus  of cash provided by operations in fiscal capital expenditures the company has avoided high levels of capital expenditures for its manufacturing functions by using independent contractors for sewing and other processes such as washing  dyeing and embroidery 
the cutting process is performed in house domestically to enhance control and efficiency  while screenprinting is performed in house both domestically and in europe 
fiscal capital expenditures were  which was comparable to the  spent two years prior and  higher than the  spent in fiscal in fiscal  the company increased its investment in company owned retail stores and also expanded its facilities in europe 
investments in computer equipment  in store shops and fixtures also continued in fiscal capital spending in fiscal included the addition of the company s domestic headquarters 
new company owned retail stores and  to a lesser extent  in store shops are again part of the company s plans in fiscal computer hardware and software will also be added to continuously improve systems 
capital spending for these and other projects in fiscal is expected to range between  and acquisitions the company made several acquisitions in fiscal hawk designs  inc was acquired in march freestyle  sa gotcha europe  which is the licensee of gotcha international in europe  was acquired by quiksilver europe in may quiksilver international was acquired in july  and fidra  inc was acquired in august the hawk designs  inc purchase added the tony hawk trademark to the company s portfolio of brands as it relates to apparel and related accessories 
the company also operates hawk stores  which sell hawk clothing  related clothing and accessories  and skate hardgoods 
quiksilver europe s acquisition of gotcha europe resulted in a new license agreement that continues through fidra was a startup business in fiscal that the company acquired from its originator  john ashworth 
initial shipments began in the third quarter of fiscal prior to the quiksilver international acquisition  the quiksilver trademarks were owned by two separate companies 
the company that is  quiksilver  inc owned the trademarks in the united states and mexico 
quiksilver international pty ltd  an australian company that is  quiksilver international  owned the trademarks everywhere else throughout the world 
historically  the company paid royalties to quiksilver international on all quiksilver sales outside the united states and mexico 
the company acquired quiksilver international effective july  from that point forward  the worldwide trademark rights have been owned by the company  and the royalty expense has been eliminated 
the initial acquisition payment was  which includes cash payments to the previous shareholders of  and transaction costs  net of imputed interest  of  two additional payments will also be made that are denominated in australian dollars  one at the end of fiscal and one at the end of fiscal the amount of these two additional payments is based on the computed earnings of quiksilver international through june   subject to specified minimums 
the minimum deferred purchase price payments totaled  on a then present value basis  and was recorded at july  as a component of the purchase price 
the deferred purchase price payment due at the end of fiscal was increased by  with a corresponding increase to trademarks  as a result of quiksilver international s operations for the months ended june  the initial payment was financed using the company s domestic line of credit 
the obligation to make the two remaining payments is included in the company s balance sheet as a component of debt 
noncash interest expense is recorded monthly to reflect the calculated financing costs associated with these remaining obligations 
the remaining obligation as of october  was  including the interest component 
debt structure the company s debt structure includes short term lines of credit and long term loans 
european banks are primarily used to finance the european business  and a syndication of us banks provides financing for the domestic business 
the domestic credit facility includes a term loan and a revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit commitment was changed in october to increase the amount by  to  the line of credit expires on june   and it bears interest based on the agent bank s reference rate or libor 
the weighted average interest rate at october  was 
the term loan is repayable in equal quarterly installments through october and amounted to  at october  the term loan bears interest contractually based on libor 
however  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate at per year 
this swap agreement is effective through october and is an effective hedge of the related interest rate exposure 
the line of credit and the term loan are secured and are subject to generally the same restrictive covenants 
the most significant covenants relate to maintaining certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the payment of dividends is restricted  among other things  and the company s assets  other than trademarks and other intellectual property  generally have been pledged as collateral 
at october   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
the company believes that the line of credit will be renewed with substantially similar terms 
the company also has another term loan with a single bank that amounted to  on october  and is repayable in installments of  per month with a final balloon payment due on october  the company anticipates that these monthly payments and final balloon payment will be paid from borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility 
this term loan was established in april and is secured by the leasehold improvements at the company s headquarters in huntington beach  california 
the interest rate structure and restrictive covenants are substantially the same as those under the syndicated credit facility 
however  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate at per year 
this swap agreement is effective through april and is an effective hedge of the related interest rate exposure 
as of october   the company had  of borrowings outstanding under the domestic line of credit and  outstanding under the domestic term loans 
in europe  the company has arrangements with several banks that provide approximately  for cash borrowings and approximately  for letters of credit 
at october   related interest rates ranged from to 
these lines of credit expire on various dates through april  and the company believes that the banks will continue to make these facilities available with substantially similar terms 
the amount outstanding on these lines of credit at october  was  at an average interest rate of 
quiksilver europe also has  of long term debt  most of which is collateralized by land and buildings 
this debt bears interest at rates ranging generally from to 
principal and interest payments are required either monthly  quarterly or annually  and the loans are due at various dates through the company s financing activities generated  of cash in fiscal  compared to  in the previous year and  the year before that 
these borrowings were used to fund the business acquisitions  capital expenditures and the inventory investments discussed above 
stock split the company s stock was split three for two in april trade accounts receivable and inventories the company s trade accounts receivable were  at october  versus  the previous year  an increase of 
of those totals  domestic receivables were basically unchanged at  compared to  and quiksilver europe s receivables increased to  from  the overall increase in receivables is generally consistent with the sales increase in the fourth quarter 
however  quiksilver europe s average days sales outstanding based on the october amounts increased somewhat offsetting the domestic improvement 
this increase occurred primarily because additional licensed boardriders clubs were opened in europe that have longer than average terms 
consolidated inventories increased to  at october  from  the year before 
the domestic component increased to  from  and the european piece increased to  from  the company s average inventory turnover was times at the end of fiscal based on a rolling average computation 
this is consistent with the rate at the end of the previous year 
however  domestic finished goods inventory levels are above optimum levels as planned sales were not achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company believes that domestic inventory levels will remain high through the first half of fiscal european inventories were increased in preparation for the upcoming spring summer season 
significant accounting estimates it is not uncommon for some of the company s customers to have financial difficulties from time to time 
this is normal given the wide variety of the company s account base  which includes small surf shops  medium sized retail chains  and some large department store chains 
in some cases  customers have ended up in bankruptcy 
however  the company s losses from these situations have been consistent with its estimates 
to allow for such losses  the company establishes reserves for doubtful accounts to reduce the value of its receivables 
management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts at october  is adequate to cover anticipated losses 
throughout the year  the company monitors developments regarding its major customers 
however  if customers experience unforeseen  material financial difficulties  this could have an adverse impact on the company s profits 
inflation inflation has been modest during the years covered by this report 
accordingly  inflation has had an insignificant impact on the company s sales and profits 
new accounting pronouncements the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on november  sfas no 
affected the company s financial statements beginning with the first quarter of fiscal by requiring that the company recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the use of the derivative 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a transition adjustment of  net of tax effects of  that was recorded as a cumulative effect type adjustment in other comprehensive income to recognize the fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
this standard eliminates the pooling method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  in addition  sfas no 
addresses the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill acquired in a business combination 
this portion of sfas no 
is effective for business combinations completed after june  the company does not expect sfas no 
to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  which revises the accounting for purchased goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but will be tested for impairment annually and also in the event of an impairment indicator 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted sfas no 
as of november  and has begun to test goodwill for impairment under the new rules  applying a fair value based test 
the company expects that adoption of sfas no 
will increase annual operating income through a reduction of amortization expense by approximately million or 
per share diluted  on an annual basis 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes previous guidance on financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  future impairment reviews may result in charges against earnings to write down the value of long lived assets 
forward looking statements certain words in this report like believes  anticipates  expects  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify  in certain cases  forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the predicted results

the company is not obligated to update these forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to a variety of risks 
two of these risks are foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates that affect interest expense 
see also note to the company s financial statements 
foreign currency and derivatives the company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales  royalty income  and product purchases of its international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from domestic transactions that are not denominated in us dollars  and to fluctuations in interest rates related to its variable rate debt 
furthermore  the company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in the company s consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of the company s international subsidiaries 
as part of its overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the company uses various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans 
in addition  interest rate swaps are used to manage the company s exposure to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
for all qualifying cash flow hedges  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income 
other derivatives  which do not qualify for hedge accounting but are used by management to mitigate exposure to currency risks  are marked to market value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
as of october   the company was hedging forecasted transactions expected to occur in the following twelve months 
assuming exchange rates at october  remain constant   of gains related to hedges of these transactions are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months 
also included in accumulated other comprehensive income at october  is a charge related to cash flow hedges of the company s long term debt that is denominated in australian dollars  totaling  which will be amortized into earnings through fiscal as the debt matures 
on the date the company enters into a derivative contract  management designates the derivative as a hedge of the identified exposure 
the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge transactions 
in this documentation  the company identifies the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and indicates how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
the company formally measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with its risk management policy 
the company would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively i if it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item  ii when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated  or exercised  iii if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur  iv because a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or v if management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
during the fiscal year ended october   the company reclassified into earnings a net loss of  resulting from the expiration  sale  termination  or exercise of derivative contracts 
additionally  a gain of  was recognized during the fiscal year ended october  for changes in the value of derivatives that were marked to market value 
the company enters into forward exchange and other derivative contracts with major banks and is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by these banks 
the company anticipates  however  that these banks will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
accordingly  the company does not obtain collateral or other security to support the contracts 
translation of results of international subsidiaries as discussed above  the company is exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of the company s international subsidiaries 
the local currency statements of income of the company s european and australian subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates effect the company s reported profits and distort comparisons from year to year 
the company uses various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans to hedge the profit and loss effects of such exposure  but the accounting rules do not allow the company to hedge the actual translation of sales and expenses 
by way of example  when the us dollar strengthens compared to the french franc or euro  there is a negative effect on quiksilver europe s reported results 
it takes more profits in french francs to generate the same amount of profits in stronger us dollars 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the us dollar weakens there is a positive effect 
in fiscal  the us dollar strengthened compared to the french franc 
so  sales of quiksilver europe increased about in french francs compared to the year before  but only increased about in us dollars 
the euro with the exception of the united kingdom  the primary countries where quiksilver europe operates adopted the euro as legal currency effective january  at that time exchange rates between the french franc and the euro were fixed 
euro denominated currency began circulating as of january  quiksilver europe began processing transactions in euros effective november  interest rates most of the company s lines of credit and long term debt bear interest based on libor 
interest rates  therefore  can move up or down depending on market conditions 
as discussed above  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to such fluctuations 
the approximate amount of remaining variable rate debt was  at october   and the average interest rate at that time was 
if interest rates were to increase by  the company s net income would be reduced by approximately  based on these fiscal levels
