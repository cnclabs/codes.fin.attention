the professional resources organization was a leading measurement assessment firm specializing in measuring the impact and return on investment of training and consulting programs 
results of operations segment review following the sale of premier during fiscal  we now have two reporting segments the consumer strategic business unit csbu and the organizational strategic business unit osbu 
the operating results of premier and our other products and services designed for teachers and students were previously reported in the education business unit  which was dissolved during fiscal our remaining student and teacher programs and products are now classified with the organizational strategic business unit results of operations 
consumer strategic business unit this business unit is focused on sales to individual customers and includes the operating results of our domestic retail stores  international stores  catalog and e commerce operations  and other related channels including wholesale sales and manufacturing operations 
although csbu sales primarily consist of products such as planners  binders  and handheld electronic planning devices  virtually any component of our leadership and productivity solutions can be purchased through csbu channels 
organizational strategic business unit the osbu is primarily responsible for the development  marketing  sale  and delivery of productivity  leadership  sales performance  and communication training solutions directly to organizational clients  including other companies  the government and educational institutions 
the osbu includes the financial results of the organizational solutions group osg and our international operations  except for retail stores 
the organizational solutions group is responsible for the domestic sale and delivery of productivity  leadership  sales performance  and communication training solutions to corporations and includes sales of training seminars to teachers and students  which were previously reported with the operating results of premier

the following table sets forth selected segment sales and consolidated operational data from continuing operations for the periods indicated

year ended august  consumer strategic business unit retail stores    catalog and ecommerce    other csbu    organizational strategic business unit osg    international    total sales    cost of sales    gross margin    selling  general  and administrative    stock option purchase and relocation costs  provision for losses on management stock loan program   impairment of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary  loss on impaired assets   restructuring cost reversals  depreciation    amortization    income loss from operations    fiscal compared with fiscal sales our overall operating performance was adversely affected by significant sales declines during fiscal the company believes that difficult economic conditions in the united states  which were worsened by the terrorist attacks that occurred on september   led to significantly reduced travel schedules for training in addition to tightened budgets for productivity tool and supply expenditures  as our corporate clients sought to decrease operating expenses 
in addition  sales of handheld electronic planning devices  which were especially popular during fiscal and fiscal  declined sharply in fiscal due to significant reduction in demand for these devices 
as a result of these and other factors  we experienced significant sales declines compared to the prior year for both training and productivity tools in our various channels 
in an effort to improve both product and training solution sales in future periods  the company has developed and is developing new training solutions specifically focused around our productivity seminars  and has developed and is developing new personal and organizational software products for our various channels 
additionally  the company recently introduced tablet pcs and related planning software  which can be purchased through many of our channels 
although the initial response to these products and seminars has been favorable  there can be no assurance that these new products will be widely accepted by our clients 
product sales  which consist primarily of planners  binders  and handheld electronic planning devices declined by million  or percent  from the prior year 
the overall decrease in product sales was significant to our retail store  catalog e commerce  and other consumer business unit channels 
retail store sales were adversely affected by declining average sales dollars per transaction combined with a decrease in consumer traffic and overall smaller number of transactions 
of the million decline in retail store sales  approximately million related to declines in the sales of handheld electronic planning devices and related accessories 
of this decline  approximately million occurred during our first two quarters of fiscal planner and binder sales through our retail stores also decreased by a total of percent compared to the prior year 
these product sales declines included a percent decline during the first two fiscal quarters compared to a eight percent decline during the last two quarters of fiscal as a result of these sales trends  comparable store stores that have been open for over a year retail sales decreased by percent compared to fiscal comparable store sales experienced a percent decrease during the first two quarters versus a percent decrease during our last two quarters of fiscal the sales performance from new stores partially offset the decline in comparable store sales  resulting in a percent overall decrease in retail store sales during fiscal as of august   we were operating domestic retail stores compared to stores at august  catalog e commerce sales declined primarily due to reduced call volume in the company s catalog call center operations  particularly during the first two quarters of fiscal  and to average order size  due primarily to declines in handheld electronic planning device sales 
training solution and training product related sales decreased by million  or percent  compared to the prior year  which was reflected in both domestic and foreign training sales during fiscal the company offers a variety of training solutions  training related product  and consulting services focused on productivity  leadership  sales performance  and communications 
with the impact of a weak domestic economy  which generally influences corporate  governmental  and educational spending  training sales during fiscal decreased due to reduced spending for both company facilitator led and on site training programs 
public program sales and training solution sales to teachers and students in the education industry also decreased compared to fiscal sales levels 
these decreases were partially offset by sales performance seminars  which increased compared to the prior year 
international product and training sales decreased slightly compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased sales in mexico  canada  continental europe  and australia 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales from brazil and the united kingdom 
sales in japan and royalty revenues from licensee operations were essentially flat compared to the prior year 
during fiscal  the continental european direct office was converted to a licensee operation  which resulted in reduced sales  but increased margins 
the company also attributes a portion of the decrease in international sales to similar economic factors that had an adverse affect on domestic product and training sales during fiscal gross margin gross margin consists of sales less cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes materials used in the production of planners and related products  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  direct costs of conducting seminars  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross margin may be affected by  among other things  prices of materials  labor rates  product sales mix  changes in product discount levels  production efficiency  and freight costs 
the company s overall gross margin during fiscal decreased to percent of sales  compared to percent in the prior year 
the decline in overall gross margin was primarily due to factors that adversely affected our gross margin during the first and second quarters of fiscal during our seasonally strong sales months in early fiscal  manufacturers of handheld electronic planning devices discounted many devices and accessories to promote sales 
these discounts affected the sale price of many of our handheld electronic devices  resulting in narrower margins 
we also experienced a shortage of certain popular planner products due to the bankruptcy of one of our key printing suppliers 
this resulted in lost sales and backorders of high margin products 
when these backordered products were eventually shipped to customers  we used more expensive overnight delivery methods  which costs could not be passed on to our customers 
the company has also experienced a shift in our product mix toward lower margin binders and planners during fiscal as a result of these and other related factors  our gross margin on product sales declined to percent compared to percent during fiscal training solution costs  as a percentage of sales  increased due to a shift in the product mix of training solutions sold in addition to lower attendance at corporate on site and public seminar events held during the year 
the cancellation and postponement of numerous seminars due to travel restrictions and declining travel subsequent to the terrorist attacks of september   significantly affected the gross margin of seminar sales during the first and second quarters of fiscal certain components of public seminar events are fixed  such as direct marketing expenses  site fees  equipment rentals  and presenter costs 
with a decline in the average number of participants per public training seminar  the fixed costs for the training seminar resulted in lower gross margins for the events 
in addition  some costs incurred for canceled seminars were not refundable 
we also developed a custom line of training products for a specific customer that had significantly lower margins than the majority of our other training kits  products  and accessories  thus negatively impacting our training gross margin 
these factors combined to reduce the training and service gross margin to percent  compared to percent in fiscal as part of our efforts to improve operating results  we are actively seeking to reduce product and seminar costs in order to improve overall gross margins 
operating expenses selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses of continuing operations decreased million  but due to decreased sales  increased as a percent of sales to percent  compared to percent of sales in the prior year 
the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to specific initiatives implemented to reduce operating expenses and exit non core activities in order to focus and align corporate strategy and improve overall profitability 
these cost reduction initiatives resulted in significantly decreased associate  advertising  travel  and computer and office supply expenses  especially during our third and fourth fiscal quarters  compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these cost reduction initiatives were severance costs  additional retail store operation costs relating to new stores opened during the year  and outsourcing implementation costs 
in connection with our decision to exit non core and unprofitable activities  we have reduced our employee base during fiscal as a result of these headcount reduction efforts  the company incurred and expensed million of severance and related costs during fiscal during fiscal  we entered into long term outsourcing agreements with electronic data systems eds to provide warehousing  distribution  information systems  and call center operations 
in addition to base charges for services provided  we have incurred and expensed transition costs necessary to operate under terms of the agreements 
these charges are not expected to recur and we expect to realize overall savings in these outsourced activities 
during fiscal  the company has implemented and continues to pursue various cost reduction initiatives and believes that our efforts will continue to reduce recurring sg a costs in fiscal and in future periods 
depreciation expense in continuing operations increased by million compared to the prior year  primarily due to the acquisition of computer software and hardware  and the addition of leasehold improvements in new and remodeled retail stores 
as the company continues to reduce capital expenditures  and recently purchased computer hardware and software becomes fully depreciated in the next few years  we expect depreciation charges to decline in future periods 
amortization expense attributable to continuing operations decreased by million  primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
 which prohibits goodwill amortization and requires a fair value approach  with periodic assessments for impairment  to value goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
 we wrote off all recorded goodwill associated with our consumer business unit  organizations business unit  and corporate services group  plus a portion of the covey trade name intangible asset  which has an indefinite life  from our balance sheet as of september  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact of adopting sfas no 
provision for losses on management stock loans the company is now the creditor for a loan program that provided certain management personnel with the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
as a result of changes to our line of credit agreement obtained in fiscal  the company is the creditor on these loans  which are full recourse to the participants and are recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
in connection with these loans  we utilize a systematic methodology to determine the level of reserves that are appropriate for potential losses resulting from the management common stock loan program 
a key factor considered by our methodology is the current market value of the common stock held by the participants  although the company is precluded by certain rules and regulations from holding the participants stock as collateral for the loans 
other factors considered by our methodology include the liquid net worth and earnings capacity of the participants  the inherent difficulties and risks of pursuing collection actions against key employees  the probability of sufficient participant repayment capability based upon the proximity to the due date of the loans  and other business  economic  and participant factors which may have an impact on the company s ability to collect the loans 
based upon our methodology  we recorded charges to operations totaling million during fiscal to increase the loan loss reserve 
at august  and  we had aggregate loan loss reserves totaling million and million  respectively  which reduce notes and interest receivable from related parties in our consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  we discontinued recording interest receivable and corresponding interest income on the loans during the quarter ended may  however  the loan participants remain liable for interest accrued over the full term of their loans  which is due when the loans mature in march the inability of some or all participants to repay their loans would have a significant adverse effect upon the financial position and future cash flows of the company 
at august   the participants loans plus accrued interest exceeded the value of the common stock held by the participants by approximately million 
should the value of the common stock continue to be insufficient to cover the balance of the loans outstanding during the loan term  the company s loan loss reserve methodology provides a basis to be fully reserved prior to the march loan maturity date 
the establishment of reserves for potential loan losses requires significant estimates and judgment by the company s management and these estimates and projections are subject to change as a result of various economic factors  most of which are not within the control of the company 
based on the methodology in place as well as other factors  charges or benefits may be reflected in our operating results in order to increase or decrease the reserve for management stock loan losses in future periods 
impairment of investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary effective september   we entered into a joint venture agreement with american marketing systems to form franklin covey coaching  llc fcc 
each partner owned percent of the joint venture and participated equally in its management 
we accounted for our investment in fcc using the equity method of accounting and reported our share of the joint venture s net income as equity in earnings of an unconsolidated subsidiary 
our share of the joint venture s earnings totaled million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal the improvement was primarily due to increased sales of ams coaching programs and reduced amortization expense at fcc 
the joint venture agreement required the company s coaching programs to achieve specified earnings thresholds beginning in fiscal the joint venture agreement did not contain an earnings threshold requirement in fiscal or the existing joint venture agreement could be terminated at the option of ams 
as a result of unfavorable coaching program performance for our programs during fiscal  ams exercised its option to terminate the existing joint venture agreement as of august  based upon our coaching program performance throughout fiscal  and expected termination of our interest in fcc  we recognized million of impairment charges to our investment in fcc during the first two quarters of fiscal the impairment charges were based upon currently available information related to negotiations with ams throughout fiscal under the provisions of a new partnership agreement that eventually terminates our interest in fcc  we received a million payment at the end of fiscal  may receive payments totaling million during fiscal  and may receive an additional million in payments from ams and fcc 
the new partnership agreement payments are comprised of the following three components ownership change payment on august   ams paid the company million for our class a ownership shares in fcc and issued new class b shares to the company 
the class b ownership shares prohibit the company from active participation in the management of fcc  but provide us the opportunity to receive and record a portion of fcc s earnings during fiscal as described below 
fcc net income recognition during fiscal  we will continue to recognize a portion of fcc s net income through cash distributions made to the company up to a maximum of million 
as we receive these payments during fiscal  we will first reduce our remaining investment in fcc to zero and recognize the excess amount as a credit to operating expenses  rather than as equity in the earnings of an unconsolidated subsidiary 
based upon current operating trends at fcc  we anticipate receiving the entire million of cash distribution payments during fiscal contingent program payment the third component of the new partnership agreement is contingent upon the earnings of our coaching programs during fiscal and september if our coaching programs achieve earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda greater than million during the month period ended september   then a final payment will be made in october for the entire contingent program payment 
the contingent payment may not exceed million  however  the contingent payment may be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis if our coaching programs fail to produce million of ebitda during the measurement period 
we will record the contingent program payment receivable as a component of other current assets to the extent it is earned during the measurement period by our coaching program financial results 
following receipt of the new partnership agreement payments  we will have no further profit participation in the earnings of fcc 
our remaining investment in franklin covey coaching  llc totaled million at august loss on impaired assets we regularly review our long lived assets for circumstances or events that indicate an asset may not be recoverable 
our losses on impaired assets consisted of the following for the periods indicated in thousands fiscal year ended august  covey trade name  not receivable from sale of subsidiary  capitalized software development costs   computer software  retail store assets  other during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reassessed the carrying value of the covey trade name  an indefinite lived intangible asset  under the provisions of sfas no 
due to declining sales and estimated future sales associated with the covey trade name  we recorded a million impairment charge to this asset 
the value of the covey trade name will continue to be evaluated in future periods and may require further impairment charges 
the note receivable from the sale of a subsidiary became impaired when the purchaser declared bankruptcy during the second quarter of fiscal the note receivable was guaranteed by the parent company of the purchaser  however  the parent company also became insolvent during fiscal and the possibility of recovery on the note receivable appears remote 
based upon unfavorable sales trends and projected sales information  we recorded total impairment charges of million for capitalized development costs related to software products that produced less than expected sales volume 
during fiscal and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of impairment charges for capitalized software development costs that were affected by similarly unfavorable sales trends and estimated sales projections 
we also recorded a million impairment charge related to a customer database management software application  which was developed and installed by an external company  and became obsolete when we selected a new database software provider 
as a result of projected negative cash flows at certain of our retail stores  we recorded impairment charges totaling million to reduce the carrying value of the long lived assets  which primarily consisted of furniture  fixtures  and leasehold improvements  of these stores to their estimated net realizable value at august  interest income and expense interest income and expense was primarily influenced by cash received from the sale of premier  which occurred on december   and the reduction of recorded interest income from management stock loan program participants 
the company used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of premier to repay and terminate our existing term note and line of credit agreement 
in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  we stopped recording interest income from participants of the management loan program 
the management stock loan program participants are still liable for the interest expense on their loans  which are due in march primarily as a result of these items  the company s interest income was essentially flat compared to the prior year and interest expense decreased by million compared to fiscal income taxes the company s effective income tax benefit rate applicable to our loss on continuing operations was significantly reduced by the valuation allowances that were recorded against our deferred income tax assets during fiscal  due to uncertainties surrounding the recovery of income tax assets against taxable income in future periods 
the company does not anticipate recognizing income tax benefits on its books from future losses  due to uncertainties associated with the utilization of the operating loss carry forwards in future periods 
loss on discontinued operations during fiscal  we sold the operations of premier agendas and discontinued our on line planning service offered at franklinplanner 
com 
under the applicable accounting rules  these operations were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
the operating results of premier and franklinplanner 
com were recorded as discontinued operations  net of tax  and consisted of the following for fiscal years through in thousands fiscal year ended august  income loss from premier operations  net of tax    loss from franklin planner 
com operations  net of tax    income loss from discontinued operations    the fiscal loss from the operations of premier covers only the period from september  through december   the closing date of the sale  a period during which premier does not recognize significant sales 
the operations of franklinplanner 
com were discontinued during the fourth quarter of fiscal gain on sale of discontinued operations effective december   we sold the operations of premier  a wholly owned subsidiary 
premier provided productivity and leadership solutions to the educational industry  including student and teacher planners 
the sale price was million in cash plus the retention of premier s working capital  which was received in the form of a million promissory note from the purchaser 
prior to the sale closing we received cash distributions from premier s working capital that totaled approximately million 
the promissory note was paid in june additionally  we will receive million of cash from premier related to income tax payments 
the company agreed not to sell student planners containing the company s habits and what matters most content directly to schools and school districts in the k through market subsequent to the closing of the sale 
we recognized a pretax gain of million million after applicable taxes on the sale of premier  which was recorded as a gain on the sale of discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal cumulative effect of accounting change effective september   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and require such assets to be tested for impairment and to be written down to fair value  if necessary 
in order to assess the value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as of september   we engaged an independent valuation firm 
the valuation process assigned the company s assets and liabilities to our operating business units and then provided a fair market value of those assets using a discounted cash flow model that also considered factors such as market capitalization and appraised values of certain assets 
based upon the results of the valuation  we expensed all of the goodwill assigned to the organizations business unit  consumer business unit  and corporate support services  plus a portion of the covey trade name intangible asset  which has an indefinite life 
the write off totaled million after applicable tax benefits 
goodwill and intangible assets assigned to the education business unit  which consisted primarily of premier  were not written down because the carrying value of that business unit s assets exceeded their book value at the measurement date 
remaining intangible assets were primarily generated from the merger with covey leadership center and were assigned to the osbu 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends increased over the prior year due to the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock during the first and second quarters of fiscal as payment for accrued preferred dividends 
the company had the option to pay accrued dividends with cash or additional shares of preferred stock until july  subsequent to that date  preferred stock dividends must be paid quarterly in cash 
accordingly  the company expects to pay all future preferred stock dividends with cash 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales product sales from continuing operations declined by million  or percent  compared to fiscal the decline in product sales primarily affected the operational results of the consumer strategic business unit  which includes retail stores  catalog and ecommerce operations  and other related channels 
retail store sales decreased primarily due to reduced consumer traffic during fiscal  combined with strong sales of handheld electronic planning devices and related accessories in fiscal the company attributes the decline in consumer traffic to deteriorating general economic conditions in the united states that began in late  cannibalization of existing store sales by newly opened stores  and slowing demand for various handheld electronic planning devices and accessories 
these factors combined to produce a percent decrease in comparable store sales  which was partially offset by the addition of new stores during fiscal the company was operating stores at august  catalog ecommerce sales declined primarily due to decreased call volume in the company s catalog operations 
however  sales through the company s web site at www 
franklincovey 
com continued to increase compared to the prior year and partially offset decreased catalog sales 
other csbu sales declined primarily due to declining wholesale sales and the sale of the commercial division of publishers press 
training and service sales from continuing operations decreased by million  or percent  compared to fiscal our training seminars and consulting services are delivered through the organizational solutions group in the united states 
osg sales decreased due to reduced on site corporate leadership and productivity seminars  corresponding reduced sales of associated training products  public program sales  and the formation of franklin covey coaching  llc to deliver coaching services 
public seminar sales declined due to an overall reduction in the number of participants attending our public programs 
the company attributes the decline in corporate and public seminar sales to economic conditions that appear to have adversely affected corporate training spending during fiscal as a result of the formation of the franklin covey coaching  llc joint venture  we no longer recognize the sales of the personal coaching division  but only recognize our share of net income from the joint venture 
international sales were essentially flat compared to fiscal  with increased sales from mexico and europe partially offset by sales decreases in australia  canada  new zealand  and at various licensee operations 
gross margin during fiscal  our overall gross margin in continuing operations improved to percent  compared to percent in fiscal our gross margin improved primarily due to reduced inventory costs resulting from improved procedures  the sale of the commercial division of publishers press  increased sales of training and services as a percent of total sales  and price increases on certain planner products and seminars 
partially offsetting these factors was the formation of franklin covey coaching  llc  which reduced our overall gross margin due to financial reporting requirements that exclude the favorable gross margins of the personal coaching business from our financial statements 
fiscal operating results did not include sales and corresponding costs from the commercial printing division of publishers press  which was sold effective february  commercial printing sales had significantly lower margins than the majority of our other products and services 
as a result of improved inventory procedures  the sale of the commercial printing operations of publishers press  and price increases on certain planner products  our gross margin on product sales improved to percent of sales compared to percent of sales in fiscal during fiscal  sales of training and consulting services  which have gross margins significantly higher than the majority of our products  increased as a percent of total sales 
in addition  we implemented numerous cost savings initiatives to offset the overall decline in training and service sales 
these factors combined to improve the training and services gross margin to percent of sales compared to percent of sales in fiscal operating expenses our selling  general  and administrative expenses in continuing operations decreased by million  net of stock option purchase and relocation costs  compared to fiscal however  due to reduced sales volume  sg a expenses increased as a percent of sales to percent  compared to percent in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to the formation of franklin covey coaching  llc  reduced catalog and related promotion costs  reduced associate costs  decreased international operating expenses  and cost reduction efforts in various areas of the company 
due to the formation of the fcc joint venture  we no longer include the operating expenses of our personal coaching division  which totaled million during fiscal  in our consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  we reduced certain catalog and promotional expenses to improve the overall profitability of our catalog ecommerce operations in light of declining sales  especially from our catalog operation 
due to declining sales volumes experienced during fiscal  we also implemented cost saving initiatives in various operating areas of the company 
partially offsetting these reductions were increased operating expenses resulting from the company s additional retail stores that were opened during fiscal depreciation expense from continuing operations increased by million compared to fiscal  primarily due to the addition of leasehold improvements and fixtures in new stores  the purchase of computer hardware and software  and the purchase of manufacturing equipment 
amortization charges decreased million  primarily due to the contribution of personal coaching intangible assets to the franklin covey coaching  llc  joint venture 
the amortization of these contributed intangibles was recorded in the operating results of franklin covey coaching  llc 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiary effective september   the company entered into a joint venture agreement with ams to form franklin covey coaching  llc 
each partner owned percent of the joint venture and participated equally in its management 
we accounted for our investment in franklin covey coaching  llc using the equity method of accounting and reported our share of the joint venture s net income as equity in earnings of an unconsolidated subsidiary 
our share of the joint venture s earnings totaled million during fiscal interest income and expense in general  interest income and expense was affected by our unfavorable operating performance during fiscal  which resulted in higher debt balances and lower cash balances when compared to fiscal in addition  interest expense increased due to larger debt balances resulting from the company s line of credit agreement signed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the new line of credit agreement included the management stock loan participants debt  which was previously guaranteed by the company 
as a result  we paid interest on amounts borrowed to acquire the loans 
interest is not due from the participants of the management stock loan program until the loans mature in march the company recognized million of additional interest income  which was recorded as a receivable from the loan participants during fiscal income taxes our effective income tax rate in fiscal was adversely affected by non deductible goodwill amortization  the effects of foreign losses  and the magnified effects of other non deductible items resulting from decreased taxable income 
amortization of goodwill primarily resulting from the merger with covey leadership center and other acquisitions was not deductible for income tax purposes and had an adverse effect on our effective tax rates in fiscal and preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends increased in fiscal over the prior year due to the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock as payment for accrued dividends 
quarterly results the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated financial data for the most recent eight quarters 
the quarterly consolidated financial data reflects  in the opinion of management  all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations for such periods and was revised to include the operational results of premier and franklinplanner 
com as discontinued operations 
additionally  the following quarterly information for fiscal was revised to reflect the cumulative effect of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
 which was retroactively recorded in our first quarter of fiscal as required by sfas no 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of continuing trends

the company s quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of customers who renew their franklin planners on a calendar year basis 
osg sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and vacation periods 
after the sale of premier in fiscal  the seasonal nature of our operations will reflect higher sales and significantly higher operating margins during the first and second quarters  with declines in sales and income generally occurring during the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year 
quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the sale of business units  the introduction of new products or training seminars  the addition of new institutional customers  the introduction of new products  the timing of large institutional orders  and the opening or closing of retail stores 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of capital have been net cash provided by operating activities  long term borrowings  line of credit financing  asset sales  and the issuance of preferred and common stock 
working capital requirements have also been financed through short term borrowing  line of credit financing  and asset sales 
during fiscal  we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of premier to retire the majority of our outstanding debt and terminate our line of credit agreement 
we have not sought to obtain a new line of credit financing agreement subsequent to this transaction 
with significantly reduced debt balances and million of cash at august   we believe that our liquidity position is strong 
however  the maintenance of adequate liquidity in future periods will be subject to the company s future investing and financing activities  and is dependent upon the company s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations and control capital expenditures 
cash flows from operating activities primarily due to a significant decline in sales and resulting operating losses during fiscal  we used million of net cash to fund operating activities during fiscal we had significant adjustments to net loss to arrive at cash flows from operating activities in fiscal  including million from the gain on sale of premier  a million charge from the adoption of sfas no 
 million of depreciation and amortization charges  and million from increases to the provision for potential losses on our management stock loan program 
consistent with prior years  the primary source of cash from operating activities was the collection of accounts receivable from premier sales  which occur primarily during our fourth fiscal quarter 
the majority of premier s accounts receivable at august  were collected prior to the sale of premier in december the primary use of operating cash was the payment of premier s accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which are seasonally high at august due to the sale of premier in fiscal  these cash flow trends in operating activities should change in future periods to reflect new seasonal sales patterns 
due to unfavorable cash flow trends from operating activities over prior years  the company has implemented numerous initiatives to improve cash flows from operating activities  including programs designed to increase sales  reduce operating costs  and decrease inventories during fiscal and in future periods 
although the success of these initiatives is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are not within our control  the company believes that we will be successful in improving our cash flows from operating activities during future periods 
cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures primarily as a result of the sale of premier  we recorded million of cash provided by investing activities during year ended august  during fiscal  we received cash proceeds totaling million from the sale of premier and received million of cash distributions from our investment in franklin covey coaching  llc 
these investing activity cash inflows were partially offset by million of capital expenditures that occurred during fiscal our fiscal capital expenditures were used to purchase computer software  computer hardware  leasehold improvements in new and remodeled retail stores  and other machinery and equipment 
during fiscal  we actively sought to reduce capital spending and focus our expenditures on critical equipment and projects and expect to continue to do so in future periods 
cash flows from financing activities cash used for financing activities in fiscal was primarily affected by our payment of substantially all of our debt balances and the termination of our line of credit facilities 
we used net cash totaling million for financing activities  of which million was used to repay debt 
we also used million of cash to settle an interest rate swap instrument and paid million of cash for preferred dividends during fiscal net cash used for financing activities during fiscal totaled million 
contractual obligations the company has not structured any special purpose entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments consist primarily of payments to electronic data systems eds for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing and distribution  and call center operations  rent expense for retail store and sales office space  cash payments for series a preferred stock dividends  and mortgage payments on certain buildings and property 
our expected payments on these obligations over the next five years are as follows in thousands maturity fiscal yea r description thereafter total minimum required payments to eds for outsourcing services     minimum lease payments     series a preferred stock dividend payments     debt principal payments total expected payments for contractual obligations     other items the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided certain management personnel with the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
as a result of changes to our line of credit agreement obtained in fiscal  the company is now the creditor on these loans  which are full recourse to the participants and are recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
for further information regarding our management stock loan program  refer to the analysis in the comparison of fiscal operating results compared to fiscal the inability of some or all of the participants to repay their loans would have a significant adverse effect upon the financial position and future cash flows of the company 
going forward  the company will continue to incur costs necessary for the operation and potential growth of the business 
we anticipate using cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities on the condition that we can return to positive cash flows from operations  and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
management anticipates that its existing capital resources should be sufficient to enable the company to maintain its current level of operations for the upcoming fiscal however  the ability of the company to maintain adequate capital for our operations is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales levels  our ability to contain costs  levels of capital expenditures  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as economic conditions and the introduction of competitive new technology and products 
the company will also continue to monitor its liquidity and may pursue additional financing alternatives  if required  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  the valuation of long lived assets  valuation of its investment in franklin covey coaching llc  the calculation of the reserve on our management stock loan program  and the establishment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in the economy and other situations that are not in the control of the company  which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
management believes that accounting for the following areas may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity allowance for doubtful accounts in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to our customers based on financial and other criteria 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts based upon estimated losses that result from the inability of customers to make required payments 
management assesses the adequacy of its allowances through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends  and the impact of current economic conditions 
sales returns and allowances costs associated with the potential return of both products and services are recorded as a reduction of sales and are recorded as an allowance for sales and returns 
these costs are based upon known returns  and trends related to the timing of returns 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we record reductions to our inventories that are equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventories 
our inventories are comprised primarily of dated calendar products and other non dated products such as binders  handheld electronic devices  stationery  and other accessories 
in order to value our dated calendar products  the company has developed a methodology that is based upon historical sales trends of dated items 
non dated inventory items are evaluated based upon historical sales trends  technological obsolescence  new product introductions  and other factors that influence estimated realizable value 
our management regularly assesses the valuation of inventories by reviewing the costing of inventory  the significance of slow moving inventory  and the impact of current economic conditions 
valuation of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including intangible assets and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life  for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of such assets  we perform an analysis of the expected discounted or undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets  as appropriate  over the remaining amortization period 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the anticipated future cash flows from the asset  the company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the deficit 
actual cash flows may differ materially from estimated future cash flows used for the evaluation of long lived assets 
valuation of investment in franklin covey coaching llc effective september   we entered into a joint venture agreement with american marketing systems ams to form franklin covey coaching  llc fcc 
each partner owned percent of the joint venture and participated equally in its management 
the joint venture agreement required our coaching programs to achieve specified earnings thresholds beginning in fiscal the joint venture agreement did not contain an earnings threshold requirement in fiscal or the joint venture agreement could be terminated at the option of ams 
as a result of worse than expected performance from our programs during fiscal  ams terminated the existing joint venture agreement as of august  as a result of this decision  we recognized impairment charges to our investment in fcc totaling million during fiscal these impairment charges were based upon the expected termination of our interest in fcc and corresponding expected cash payments and expected return of certain tangible assets 
prior to the end of fiscal a new partnership agreement was obtained that could pay the company up to million over the life of the agreement 
for further information regarding the new partnership agreement  refer to the equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiary in the comparison of fiscal results with fiscal loan loss reserve on management stock loan program the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided certain management personnel with the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
these loans are full recourse to the participants and are recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in order to assess the net realizable value of these loans  the company utilizes a systematic methodology for determining the level of loan loss reserves that are appropriate for the management common stock loan program 
a key factor considered by the company s methodology is the current market value of common stock held by the participants 
other factors considered by the methodology include the liquid net worth and earnings capacity of the participants  the inherent difficulties and risks of pursuing collection actions against key employees  the probability of sufficient participant repayment capability based upon the proximity to the due date of the loans  and other business  economic  and participant factors which may have an impact on the company s ability to collect the loans 
based upon this methodology  the company recorded charges to operations totaling million during fiscal to increase the loan loss reserve 
as of august   the company had an aggregate loan loss reserve totaling million  which reduces notes and interest receivable from related parties in our consolidated balance sheets 
for further information regarding the management stock loans and the corresponding reserve for loan losses  refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation allowances on deferred tax assets based upon the weight of available evidence  and the nature and duration of various deferred tax assets  we determined that it is more likely than not that the related benefits from deferred tax deductions and foreign tax carryforwards will not be realized 
accordingly  we recorded the appropriate valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets during fiscal new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb released sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments the principal financial instrument risks to which the company is exposed are fluctuations in foreign currency rates and interest rates 
the company utilizes certain derivative instruments to enhance its ability to manage risk 
derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
foreign exchange sensitivity due to the nature of the company s global operations  we are involved in transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which creates exposure to currency exchange rate risk 
the company regularly utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of certain intercompany and other transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these forward contracts are generally settled and renewed on a quarterly basis and do not meet specific hedge accounting requirements 
corresponding gains and losses have been recorded as a component of current operations  which offset gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
as a result of our use of foreign currency exchange contracts  we recorded net losses totaling million during fiscal  net gains of million during fiscal  and net losses totaling million during fiscal all of our foreign currency exchange contracts were settled prior to august  however  the company intends to continue utilizing foreign currency exchange contracts in future periods to offset potential foreign currency exchange risks 
interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to fluctuations in us interest rates primarily as a result of the cash that we hold and our borrowing activities 
following payment and termination of our line of credit facility during fiscal  our remaining debt balances consisted primarily of fixed rate long term mortgages on our buildings and property
