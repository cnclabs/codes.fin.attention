webex interactive platform the webex interactive platform is an information switching and service provisioning software platform that is designed to provide high reliability  accommodate variable levels of traffic and activity and offer comprehensive functionality 
the webex interactive platform enables the rapid development  by webex or third party developers  of interactive services that can be easily integrated into any website or web application using a set of standards based application programming interfaces  or apis 
these interactive services can be deployed over multiple servers and locations  enabling each group of servers to quickly accommodate a large number of meetings 
the core functionality of the webex interactive platform is provided by the following service managers meeting manager provides reliable  real time data switching to all participants  and includes full data sharing functionality for documents  presentations  applications and web content  as well as live video

the webex interactive network includes high capacity internet connections for high speed connectivity and redundancy  webex proprietary switches in data centers located across the us  europe and asia  in our own facilities and at third party co location facilities  our network operations centers  located in california and colorado  where we monitor the webex interactive network hours a day  seven days a week  the ability to dynamically add capacity at any facility  enabling each webex switching cluster to scale to meet changes in user demand  network management software to minimize technical issues  and sophisticated diagnostic software for troubleshooting and rapid problem resolution 
customers and distribution partners we sell our services directly to our customers and indirectly through our distribution partners 
we offer our services on a monthly subscription basis to our customers and through a revenue share  discounted or pay per use basis to our distribution partners 
our customers purchase and use our services themselves while our distribution partners integrate and resell our services with their offerings 
some of our distribution partners also use our services themselves 
as of december   we had subscription agreements with over  customers 
in  we derived more than of our revenue from direct sales to customers 
as of december   we had agreements in place with approximately distribution partners  including portals  software and service vendors and communications service providers 
in we generated less than of our revenue from these relationships 
software and service vendors have agreements to resell our services to end users by marketing  and in some cases integrating  our services into their product or service offerings 
communications service providers typically resell our services in conjunction with their teleconferencing services 
our distribution agreements typically have terms of one to three years and are automatically renewed for additional one year terms unless either party terminates the agreement with days prior written notice 
in most of these agreements  the distribution partner purchases subscription services from webex and resells such services to end user customers 
under these agreements  the amount of revenue we receive depends on the level of commitment and volume of business generated under the agreement 
under our distribution agreements  either webex or the distribution partner bills the end user customers 
when webex bills the end user  a percentage of the proceeds generated from the distribution partner s sale of webex services are paid to the distribution partner and the remainder is retained by webex 
when the distribution partner bills the end user  webex sells the services on a discounted basis to the distribution partner  which in turn marks up the price  and sells the services to the end user 
technology licenses we have licensed technology from certain technology and service providers in areas complementary to our services  such as teleconferencing  font technology and communications infrastructure providers 
we believe these technology licenses allow us to integrate current and emerging technology into our service offerings 
our technology licenses include bitstream font technology  tibco software information distribution and voyant teleconferencing 
research and development the emerging market for interactive communications services for websites is characterized by rapid technological change  new product introductions and enhancements  evolving customer requirements and rapidly changing industry standards 
we devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing and enhancing our network services and application platform  extending our global network  and conducting quality assurance testing 
as of december   we had employees engaged in research and development activities 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to devote significant resources to research and development for the foreseeable future 
a significant amount of our development and testing activity is conducted by two companies in china  which are owned by the spouse of one of our executive officers  mr 
min zhu 
we have contracts with these companies under which they perform development projects  assign ownership of the work performed to us  and invoice us for services rendered based on a monthly fee per employee working on webex projects 
mr 
zhu has represented and the company believes that neither mr 
zhu nor his wife receive any compensation or income from these companies in the form of salaries  bonuses  dividends  profits or otherwise 
sales and marketing our sales efforts target a broad range of businesses primarily through direct sales channels and to a lesser extent through indirect sales channels 
direct sales are generated through our internal sales force  while indirect sales are generated through revenue sharing agreements with our distribution partners 
our internal sales force uses our own webex services to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of our direct sales channel 
our marketing programs include customer needs assessment and market analysis  service and platform marketing  brand awareness  advertising  public relations  lead generation  and educating organizations in our target markets 
competition the market for interactive communication services is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies and technologies in regards to specific elements of our services 
for example  we compete with providers of traditional communications technologies such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing as well as applications software and tools companies  such as centra software  raindance communications  lotus sametime  microsoft netmeeting and placeware 
some of our current or potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously harm our ability to sell services on terms favorable to us 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include service functionality  quality and performance  ease of use  reliability  scalability and security of services  establishing a significant base of customers and distribution partners  ability to introduce new services to the market in a timely manner  customer service and support  attracting third party developers  and pricing 
although we believe our services compete favorably with respect to each of these factors  the market for our services is new and rapidly evolving 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with greater resources 
intellectual property the status of united states patent protection in the internet industry is not well defined and will evolve as the us patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
we currently have three issued patents in the areas of creating network connections for conferencing  document annotation and optimizing data transfer and patent applications pending in the united states 
we may seek additional patents in the future 
we do not know if our patent applications or any future patent application will result in any patents being issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if at all  or whether any patents we have or may receive will be challenged or invalidated 
it is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states  and our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours 
we will continue to assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent and other intellectual property protections for those aspects of our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages 
the pending and any future applications may not result in the issuance of valid patents 
our success depends in part upon our rights in proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret  trademark and contractual protection to establish and protect our proprietary rights  and we enter into confidentiality agreements with those of our employees and consultants involved in the development of our services 
we routinely require our employees  customers and potential business distribution partners to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements before we will disclose any confidential aspects of our services  technology or business plans 
in addition  we require employees to agree to assign to us any proprietary information  inventions or other intellectual property they generate or come to possess while employed by us 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services or technology 
these precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  other parties may assert infringement claims against us 
although we have not received notice of any alleged infringement of third party patents  our services may infringe issued patents that relate to our services 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  we may be unaware of filed applications which relate to our services 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business  including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
this litigation could also require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including in research and development  in sales and marketing in set up  support and training  and in general and administrative 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe our relations with our employees are good 
item properties we currently lease approximately  square feet in three buildings in san jose  california  which are used for sales  engineering  support  network operations  and general corporate functions  including our corporate headquarters

com 
since february  our activities have been focused on continuing to enhance and market our webex interactive platform and our webex meeting center service  developing and deploying new services  expanding our sales and marketing organizations  and deploying our global webex interactive network 
we currently provide the following four services webex meeting center  webex business exchange  webex oncall and webex onstage 
during and  we sold a limited number of perpetual software licenses for software delivered to customers 
under statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  we recognize revenue from perpetual software license agreements upon shipment of the software when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
in february  with the introduction of webex meeting center  we began providing our customers and distribution partners access to our hosted services under subscription and other service arrangements and discontinued selling software licenses to end users 
under these arrangements  end users access our services hosted on our servers via a website or web browser 
under the consensus published by the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board for issue no 
 application of aicpa sop to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  hosted services revenue is recognized ratably over the service period  which varies from to months  and includes software use subscription fees  user set up fees  and hosting fees in limited cases of customer dedicated hosted software 
initial fees received in connection with these arrangements are recognized ratably over the initial term of the contract  which is generally three months 
during the initial term  webex provides training services  web page design and set up services 
in addition to the subscription services revenue  we derive revenue from pay per use services and telephony charges which are recognized as the related services are provided 
persuasive evidence for all of our arrangements is represented by a signed contract 
collectibility of guaranteed minimum revenue commitments by resellers cannot be reasonably assured  thus revenue from guaranteed minimum commitments is deferred until services are sold by the reseller to an end user customer or until the guaranteed minimum commitment is both earned by webex and paid by the reseller 
collectibility of all other arrangements is reasonably assured at the date of the sale 
an estimate of the sales reserve for losses on receivables due to customer cancellations or terminations is recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of the sale 
the sales reserve is estimated based on an analysis of the historical rate of cancellations or terminations 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the rate of future cancellations or terminations being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of actual cancellations or terminations is greater than the historic rate  then the sales reserve may not be sufficient to provide for actual losses 
we sell our services directly to our customers and indirectly through our distribution partners 
we offer our services on a monthly subscription basis directly to our customers and on a revenue sharing  discounted or pay per use basis through our distribution partners 
in cases where webex collects from the end user  revenue is recognized at the gross amount received from end users with payments made to distribution partners recorded as a commission expense 
in cases where the distribution partner collects from the end user  revenue is recognized at the net amount earned from the distribution partner 
cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses for delivering our services to websites and supporting our customers and distribution partners 
these expenses include the cost of user set up  hosting the service and technical support and training  including internet communication access and telephony costs  personnel  licensed software and equipment costs and depreciation 
training costs  which are expensed as incurred  are recovered in the initial set up fee charged to customers 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions and other expenses related to the sale of our services to customers and establishing partner relationships  as well as marketing campaigns to generate sales leads and to build awareness of the webex brand 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel  equipment  consulting and other expenses associated with designing  developing and testing our services and the software underlying our services 
in addition to our us based engineering group  we have contracts with affiliated companies in china under which contract engineers to these companies provide a variety of quality assurance and software development activities 
we compensate these third parties based on the direct cost of their services and not on development milestones 
general and administrative expense includes personnel and associated expenses relating to general management  finance  legal  human resources and expenses for bad debt 
office space expense is allocated by department 
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to general and administrative expense as bad debt expense 
losses on accounts receivable due to financial distress or failure of the customer are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance is estimated based on an analysis of the historical rate of credit losses 
the accuracy of this estimate is dependent on the future rate of credit losses being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of future credit losses is greater than the historic rate  then the allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to provide for actual credit losses 
equity based compensation expense consists of amortization of deferred equity based compensation resulting from the grant of stock options at exercise prices less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date for employees and the fair value of stock options and warrants granted to non employees 
as of december  and december   we had recorded cumulative deferred equity based compensation costs of approximately million and million  respectively  in connection with the grant of stock options and warrants to employees and non employees 
based on outstanding options granted to non employees and employees as of december   we expect to incur equity based compensation expense of at least million in and million in in connection with the calculation of equity based compensation expense  members of the company s board of directors are treated the same as employees of the company 
as of december  and december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and million  respectively 
these losses have been funded primarily through the private and public issuances of equity securities 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase as we continue to expand our business 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenue 
years ended december  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative equity based compensation total operating expenses operating loss other income  net net loss revenue 
revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in  representing an increase of from to and an increase of from to this increase was primarily due to growth in our subscribing customer base which more than doubled from the end of to the end of cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in as a percent of revenue  cost of revenue increased from in to in and decreased to in the increased cost of revenue was primarily due to increases in the cost for delivering our services to more customers  additional technical staff to support our growing installed base of customers  and expanding and improving our worldwide network 
we anticipate that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars in relative to as we increase staff and equipment required to support anticipated increases in our customer base 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the increase from to was primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel in connection with the building of our sales force  higher sales commissions associated with increased sales volume  and marketing activities to generate leads and build brand awareness 
in  our sales and marketing spending decreased in absolute dollars compared to due to decreases in marketing spending on advertising focused on our building brand awareness 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in our sales force and higher sales commissions as our sales volume increased 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars in relative to  as we increase our sales force and marketing activities to generate leads and build brand awareness 
research and development 
research and development expense increased from million in to million in and to million in the increases were primarily related to personnel related expenses resulting from an increase in headcount and incremental payments to companies in china providing engineering services for webex on a contract basis 
included in research and development expense are million  million  and million  in  and  respectively  for the cost of engineering services provided by these companies in china 
we anticipate that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in relative to as we continue to expand our service offerings and service functionalities and through the addition of new personnel working on research and development 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  legal and general management  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and accounting  and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in and to million in the increases were primarily due to professional fees  bad debt expense  personnel and payroll related expenses 
bad debt expense increased from million in to million in and to million in we anticipate that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in relative to as we hire additional administrative personnel 
equity based compensation 
our equity based compensation expense represents the amortization of deferred equity based compensation over the vesting period of options granted to employees and expenses related to issuance of common stock warrants and options to non employees 
deferred equity based compensation represents the difference between the exercise price of the stock options granted to employees and the fair value of common stock at the time of those grants 
equity based compensation expense increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in equity based compensation expense related to the unvested portion of non employee options will be impacted by future changes in our stock price and will fluctuate accordingly 
in connection with the calculation of equity based compensation expense  members of the company s board of directors are treated the same as employees of the company 
other income  net 
other income  net is comprised of investment income net of interest and other expenses 
other income  net increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the increase in from was primarily due to higher cash balances in compared to  as a result of interest income earned on cash received from our series c and d preferred stock issuance and our initial public offering of common stock 
the decrease in from was primarily due to an impairment write down of million of our million investment in a distribution partner  tonbu  inc  and lower interest rates available for cash balances 
the impairment charge resulted from a determination that an other than temporary decline in its value had occurred after the evaluation of several factors  including recent capital raising activities undertaken by tonbu  inc income taxes 
because we incurred net operating losses in  and  we paid no federal  state and foreign income taxes in those periods nor have we recognized any tax benefits for the related tax operating loss carryforwards 
we have concluded it is more likely than not that such benefits will not be utilized 
as of december   we had approximately million and million of net operating loss carryforwards for both federal and state purposes  respectively  available to offset income in future years 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years from to and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in the year as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes 
the foreign net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely 
net loss 
as a result of the foregoing  net loss  excluding equity based compensation expense  was million  million and million  and net loss  including such expense  was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations primarily from the private sales of preferred equity securities 
upon completion of our initial public offering of common stock  a total of  shares were sold to the public  which resulted in proceeds to webex  after offering expenses of million 
in  we sold an additional  shares of common stock in a private placement  which resulted in net proceeds to webex of million 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents were million  an increase of million compared with cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in cash used in operating activities was primarily used to fund net operating losses and increases in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash used by investing activities related primarily to capital expenditures for equipment  hardware and software used in our data operations center from which we operate our internet communication platform  and a loan to our chief executive officer in which was partially repaid in net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the sale of our series c and d preferred stock in and  the initial public offering in and the private placement of common stock and bank borrowings in we also receive funds from time to time from the exercise of options or similar rights to purchase shares of our common stock 
we currently have no other material external sources of liquidity 
on march  webex entered into a loan agreement with a bank that allows webex to borrow up to  or of eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the agreement 
under this agreement  webex could initially borrow up to  under a revolving credit line bearing interest at above the prime rate maturing april   and up to  on term advances bearing interest at above the prime rate maturing september  under the terms of the agreement  the interest rates will be reduced by after a profitability date  defined in the agreement as the date webex achieves a quarterly profit before deduction of equity based compensation charges 
effective september   the agreement was amended to convert the entire  of borrowing capacity to the revolving credit line 
as of december   available borrowings under the agreement totaled  amounts borrowed under the revolving credit line may be repaid and reborrowed at any time prior to the maturity date 
the loan agreement is collateralized by all tangible and intangible assets of webex and is subject to compliance with covenants  including a minimum liquidity ratio  minimum cash balance  minimum tangible net worth  maximum quarterly operating losses adjusted for equity based compensation charges  and minimum quarterly revenue 
as of december   the interest rate was and the company was in compliance with these covenants 
as of december   our outstanding purchase commitments  including usage of telecommunication lines and data services  equipment and software purchases and construction of leasehold improvements at new leased facilities  totaled million 
we lease office facilities under various operating leases that expire through total future minimum lease payments  net of sublease rental income  under these leases amount to approximately million 
we expect that existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we generated positive cash flow from operations of million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of we anticipate that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in  and that existing cash reserves will therefore be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements during this period 
if revenue in is less than anticipated  we may take steps to reduce our discretionary expenses  such as marketing  reduce planned capital expenditures or limit the growth of sales personnel 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned technology and product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
sfas is required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december   with certain early adoption permitted 
we will adopt sfas for our first quarter of  and the adoption will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
we will adopt sfas for our first quarter of  and the adoption will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas is required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december   with early application permitted 
we will adopt sfas for our first quarter of  and the adoption will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
factors that may affect results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if an adverse outcome of any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we incurred net losses in   and while we realized net earnings  before equity based compensation  in the fourth quarter of  there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve these results in the future  and we may experience net losses in future quarters 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  our net losses were approximately of revenue for the year ended december  while we realized net earnings in the fourth quarter of  before equity based compensation  we may experience net losses in future quarters 
if we incur net losses in the future  we may not be able to maintain or increase the number of our employees  our investment in expanding our network services and application platform or our sales  marketing and research and development programs in accordance with our present plans  each of which is critical to our long term success 
because our quarterly results vary and are difficult to predict  we may fail to meet quarterly financial expectations  which may cause our stock price to decline 
we commenced operations in february and our business originally consisted of consulting services 
in early  we licensed an interactive communications product to a small number of customers 
we began offering webex meeting center in february  our first real time  interactive multimedia communications service  and began selling this service to customers and distribution partners 
because of our limited operating history providing services and other factors  our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict 
in addition  because of the emerging nature of the market for interactive communications services for websites  our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
a number of other factors could cause fluctuations in our operating results 
factors outside our control include our distribution partners degree of success in distributing our services to end users  the announcement  introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced services or products by our competitors  changes in pricing policies of our competitors  and the growth rate of the market for interactive communications services for websites 
factors within our control include our ability to develop  enhance and maintain our network services and application platform in a timely manner  the mix of services we offer  our ability to attract and retain customers  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business and network infrastructure  the announcement  introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced services or products by us  and changes in our pricing policies 
if any of these factors impact our business in a particular period  our operating results may be below market expectations  in which case the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
also  factors such as the growth rate of the market for our services  our ability to maintain and enhance our network services and platform and our competitors success could impact our longer term financial performance by reducing demand for our services 
we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase and if our revenue does not correspondingly increase  our business and operating results will suffer 
we expect to continue to spend substantial financial and other resources on developing and introducing new services  and expanding our sales and marketing organization and network infrastructure 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectations of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect  we may be unable to reduce proportionately our operating expenses for that quarter  in which case our operating results for that quarter would be adversely affected 
our customers do not have long term obligations to purchase our services  therefore our revenue and operating results could decline if our customers do not continue to use our services 
our customers do not have long term obligations to purchase services from us 
most of our subscription agreements have an initial term of three months 
although automatically renewed unless terminated  our contracts can be terminated on thirty days notice at the end of the initial term or any renewal term 
over of our customers have agreements with initial terms of three to months 
in the calendar year  over of the contracts entered into were renewed beyond their initial term 
we may terminate customers who have failed to pay for our services 
in the last six months of  we terminated approximately customers who had failed to pay for our services on a timely basis 
we anticipate that termination of non paying customers will continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  some customers may voluntarily discontinue use of our services for a variety of reasons including the failure of the customer s employees to learn about and use our services  the failure of the services to meet the customer s expectations or requirements  financial difficulties experienced by the customer  and the customer s decision to use services or products offered by a competitor 
we may not obtain a sufficient number of additional customers to compensate for any customers that we may lose 
the loss of existing customers or our failure to obtain additional customers would harm our business and operating results 
our business and operating results may suffer if we fail to establish distribution relationships or if our distribution partners do not successfully market and sell our services 
to date  we have generated more than of our revenue from direct sales to customers 
as of december   we had distribution agreements in place with approximately distribution partners 
for the year ended december   we generated less than of our revenue from our distribution partners  which revenue consisted of initial set up fees  commitment payments  and service fees 
the majority of the payments received from our distribution partners have been initially recorded as deferred revenue because we defer revenue related to initial set up fees received at the beginning of the relationship and record revenue from subscription services over the course of the service period as the distribution partner resells our services 
we also do not recognize commitment fees as revenue until the commitment fee is fully earned at the end of the commitment period and paid 
we cannot anticipate the amount of revenue we will derive from these relationships in the future 
we must continue to establish and extend these distribution partnerships 
establishing these distribution relationships can take as long as several months or more 
it typically takes several months before our distribution arrangements generate significant revenue 
our distribution partners are not prohibited from offering and reselling the products and services of our competitors and may choose to devote insufficient resources to marketing and supporting our services or to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products and services of other companies 
if we fail to establish new distribution relationships in a timely manner or if our distribution partners do not successfully distribute our services  our ability to achieve market acceptance of our interactive communications services for websites will suffer and our business and operating results will be harmed 
we expect to depend on sales of our webex meeting center service for the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our webex meeting center service integrates data  audio and video to allow end users to participate in meetings online 
our webex meeting center service accounted for more than of our revenue for the year ended december  we anticipate that revenue from our webex meeting center service will continue to constitute the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
any decline in the demand for our webex meeting center service  or its failure to achieve broad market acceptance  would seriously harm our business 
if our services fail to function when used by large numbers of participants  we may lose customers and our business and reputation may be harmed 
our strategy requires that our services be able to accommodate large numbers of meetings at any one time 
our network monitoring measures the capacity of our services by bandwidth use  and during the year  our average peak usage has been running at less than of our capacity 
however  if we fail to increase our capacity consistent with our growth in usage  it could impact system performance 
in addition  we may encounter performance problems when making upgrades and modifications to our network 
if our services do not perform adequately  we may lose customers and be unable to attract new customers and our operating results could suffer 
our sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our quarterly operating results 
we sometimes have a long sales cycle because of the need to educate potential customers regarding the benefits of interactive communications services for websites 
our sales cycle varies depending on the size and type of customer contemplating a purchase 
potential customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision makers within their organization and may evaluate competing products and services prior to deciding to use our services 
our sales cycle  which can range from several weeks to several months or more  makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which use of our services may begin 
the existence of significant equity based compensation will negatively impact earnings 
as of december  we had approximately million in deferred equity based compensation 
this expense will generally be amortized over a two year period and will result in a decrease in earnings or an increase in losses 
we expect the amount of equity based compensation expense to decrease over time as a result of the vesting of options granted prior to our initial public offering 
however  the amount of future equity based compensation expense related to the unvested portion of option grants to non employees will fluctuate with the stock price and accordingly the amount of future equity based compensation expense is difficult to predict 
in and  we granted stock options at exercise prices significantly lower than the deemed fair value  which has contributed to our equity based compensation expense 
if our branding and marketing efforts are not successful  our business may be harmed 
we believe that continued marketing and brand recognition efforts will be critical to achieve widespread acceptance of our interactive communications services 
our marketing and advertising campaigns or branding efforts may not be successful or consumers may not find our marketing efforts compelling 
if our marketing efforts are not successful  our business and operating results will be harmed 
we rely on related companies in china which exposes us to risks of economic instability in china and risks related to political tension between china and the united states 
we currently rely on two related companies located in china  webex haifei and webex hong zhou  to conduct quality assurance testing and software development activities 
these companies are owned by the spouse of min zhu  one of our executive officers 
mr 
zhu has represented and the company believes that neither mr 
zhu nor his wife receive any compensation or income from these companies in the form of salaries  bonuses  dividends  profits or otherwise 
we have contracts with these companies under which they perform development projects  assign ownership of the work performed to us  and invoice us for services rendered based on a monthly fee per employee working on webex projects 
most of the personnel who conduct these activities are contract engineers to these companies 
although our transactions with these companies are approved by our disinterested directors  because these companies are owned by the spouse of one of our executive officers  there may be a perception that the terms of those arrangements are influenced by that relationship 
our reliance on independent contractors located in china for quality assurance and software development activities exposes us to a variety of economic and political risks including but not limited to  trade restrictions  tariffs and travel restrictions 
the loss of these arrangements may cause our costs to increase 
in addition  current political and economic tensions between the united states and china could harm our ability to conduct operations in china  which could increase our operating costs and harm our business and operations 
we could incur unexpected costs resulting from claims relating to use of our services 
many of the business interactions supported by our services are critical to our customers businesses 
any failure in a customer s business interaction or other communications activity caused or allegedly caused by our services could result in a claim for damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure  and cause us to incur unexpected costs 
our customers and end users may use our services to share confidential and sensitive information and if our system security is breached  our reputation could be harmed and we may lose customers 
our customers and end users may use our services to share confidential and sensitive information  the security of which is critical to their business 
third parties may attempt to breach our security or that of our customers 
we may be liable to our customers for any breach in security and any breach could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers 
in addition  computers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to resolve problems caused by any breach 
the software underlying our services is complex and our business and reputation could suffer if our services fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems with our underlying software 
complex software  such as the software underlying our services  often contains undetected errors 
we may be forced to delay commercial release of our services until problems are corrected and  in some cases  may need to implement enhancements to correct errors that we do not detect until after deployment of our services 
if we do detect an error in our software before we introduce new versions of our services  we might have to limit our services for an extended period of time while we address the problem 
in addition  problems with the software underlying our services could result in damage to our reputation  damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  loss of or delay in revenue  delays in or loss of market acceptance of our services  and unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 
if our services do not work with the many hardware and software platforms used by our customers and end users  our business may be harmed 
we currently serve customers and end users who use a wide variety of constantly changing hardware and software applications and networking platforms 
if our services are unable to support these platforms  they may fail to gain broad market acceptance  which would cause our operating results to suffer 
our success depends on our ability to deliver our services to multiple platforms and existing  or legacy  systems and to modify our services and underlying technology as new versions of applications are introduced 
in addition  the success of our services depends on our ability to anticipate and support new standards  especially web standards 
we license third party technologies  and if we cannot continue to license these or alternate technologies in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms  our business could suffer 
we intend to continue to license technologies from third parties  including applications used in our research and development activities and technology which is integrated into our services 
for example  we license real time database replication software and font rendering technology 
these third party technologies and any that we may utilize in the future may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  we may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our services 
this in turn could harm our business and operating results 
our recent growth has placed a strain on our infrastructure and resources and if we fail to manage our future growth to meet customer and distribution partner requirements  our business could suffer 
we have experienced a period of rapid expansion in our personnel  facilities  and infrastructure that has placed a significant strain on our resources 
for example  our personnel increased from employees at december  to at december   and we expect continued increases in our personnel in our expansion has placed  and we expect that it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
any failure by us to effectively manage our growth could disrupt our operations or delay execution of our business plan and could consequently harm our business 
if we lose the services of subrah s 
iyar  our chief executive officer  or min zhu  our president and chief technical officer  our business may be harmed 
our success will depend on our senior executives 
in particular  the loss of the services of our chief executive officer and co founder  subrah s 
iyar  or our president  chief technical officer and co founder  min zhu  would harm our business 
we do not have long term employment agreements with or life insurance policies on any of our senior management 
if we are unable to attract  integrate and retain qualified personnel  our business could suffer 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled engineering  technical  managerial  sales and marketing and customer support personnel 
we hired approximately people in the year ending december   and we expect to continue to increase our personnel in in the past  we have had difficulty hiring qualified personnel as quickly as we have desired 
in particular  we have had difficulty hiring a sufficient number of qualified technical  development and support personnel 
although economic conditions in made hiring of personnel easier  we do not know what future labor market conditions will be 
if we encounter difficulty hiring  integrating and retaining a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future  the quality of our services may be adversely affected 
if we fail to retain and recruit necessary sales  marketing or other personnel  our ability to develop new services and to provide a high level of customer service  and consequently our business  could suffer 
in addition  if we hire employees from our competitors  these competitors may claim that we have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against any of these claims  regardless of their merits 
interruptions in either our internal or outsourced computer and communications systems could reduce our ability to provide our services and could harm our business and reputation 
the success of our interactive communications services for websites depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our internal and outsourced computer and communications hardware and software systems 
any system failure that causes an interruption in our interactive communications services or a decrease in their performance could harm our relationships with our customers and distribution partners 
in this regard  some of our communications hardware and software are hosted at third party co location facilities 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  telecommunications failures  physical or remote break ins  sabotage  computer viruses and intentional acts of vandalism 
in addition  third party co location facilities may discontinue their operations due to poor business performance 
because a substantial part of our central computer and communications hardware and network operations are located in the san francisco bay area  an earthquake or other natural disaster could impair the performance of our entire network 
in the event of damage to or interruption of our internal or outsourced systems  if we are unable to implement our disaster recovery plans or our efforts to restore our services to normal levels in a timely manner are not successful  our business would be adversely affected 
in addition  business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 
we might have liability for content or information transmitted through our communications services 
we face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials transmitted through our web based communications services 
any imposition of liability could harm our reputation and our business and operating results  or could result in the imposition of criminal penalties 
our success depends upon the patent protection of our software and technology 
our success and ability to compete depend to a significant degree upon the protection of our underlying software and our proprietary technology through patents 
we regard the protection of patentable inventions as important to our future opportunities 
we currently have three issued patents in the areas of peer to peer connections to facilitate conferencing  document annotation and optimizing data transfer and patent applications pending in the united states and we may seek additional patents in the future 
these patent applications cover different aspects of the technology used to deliver our services and are important to our ability to compete 
however  it is possible that any patents acquired by or issued to us may not be broad enough to protect us  any issued patent could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties  which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in those patents  current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our services or design around any of our patents  our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which we do business 
we also rely upon trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our technology  which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
we also rely on a combination of laws  such as copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses  to establish and protect our technology 
our trademarks include activetouch  webex word and design  webex bifurcated ball design  webex power button design  webex 
com  bringing the meeting to you  mediatone  meeting center  webex meeting center  webex sound mark  meeting enable your web site  we ve got to start meeting like this  powering real time business meetings  and one button  infinite power are our trademarks 
we also refer to trademarks of other corporations and organizations in this document 
also  our software is automatically protected by copyright law 
these forms of intellectual property protection are critically important to our ability to establish and maintain our competitive position 
however  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights  laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter others from developing similar technologies  effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries  other companies may claim common law trademark rights based upon state or foreign laws that precede the federal registration of our marks  and policing unauthorized use of our services and trademarks is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it  which would significantly harm our business 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of the copyrights  trademarks and patents of third parties 
although we have not received notice of any alleged patent infringement  our services may infringe issued patents that may relate to our services 
in addition  because the contents of patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  we may be unaware of filed patent applications relating to our services 
from time to time we receive notices alleging that we have infringed trademarks or related rights of third parties 
in such cases  we typically investigate and respond to the allegations 
while we are not aware of any such allegations that we believe represent a material risk to the company  it is possible that the company could become involved in intellectual property litigation in the future 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
this litigation could also require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  in the event of a successful claim of infringement 
our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders  cause us to incur significant expenses or harm our operating results 
we may acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies or services 
we invested million in tonbu  inc  a privately held distribution partner  in january we wrote down  of this investment in the three months ending september  the future value of this investment is uncertain and could result in further write downs of all or part of the investment 
as of december   we had no other specific agreements or commitments with respect to any acquisitions or investments 
integrating any newly acquired businesses  technologies or services may be expensive and time consuming 
to finance any acquisitions  it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and  in the case of equity financings  may result in dilution to our stockholders 
we may be unable to complete any acquisitions or investments on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
even if completed  we may be unable to operate any acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement our growth strategy successfully 
if we are unable to integrate any newly acquired entities or technologies effectively  our operating results could suffer 
future acquisitions by us could also result in large and immediate write downs  or incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  any of which could harm our operating results 
we must compete successfully in the interactive communications services market 
the market for interactive communications services is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and is significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies in regards to specific elements of our interactive communications services 
for example  we compete with providers of traditional communications technologies such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  applications software and tools companies  and web conferencing services  such as centra software  genesys  raindance  lotus sametime  microsoft netmeeting and placeware 
we also face potential competition from a variety of enterprise software vendors  such as microsoft and oracle  any of which could choose to extend their products and services to include interactive communications 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do 
our current and future competitors maybe able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established  and may in the future establish  cooperative relationships with third parties and with each other to increase the availability of their products and services to the marketplace 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services  either of which could harm our business and operating results 
our future success depends on the broad market adoption and acceptance of interactive communications services for websites 
the market for interactive communications services for websites is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
market demand for communications services over the web is uncertain 
if the market for interactive communications services does not grow  our business and operating results will be harmed 
factors that might influence market acceptance of our services include the following  all of which are beyond our control willingness of businesses and end users to use interactive communications services for websites  the growth of the web and commercial on line services  the willingness of our distribution partners to integrate interactive communications services for websites in their service offerings  and the ongoing level of security and reliability for conducting business over the web 
our success depends on the continued growth of web usage and the continued growth in reliability and capacity of the internet 
because customers access our network through the web  our revenue growth depends on the continued development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this continued development of the web would include maintenance of a reliable network with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  as well as timely development of complementary products and services  including high speed modems  for providing reliable internet access and services 
because global commerce on the web and the on line exchange of information is new and evolving  we cannot predict whether the web will continue to be a viable commercial marketplace over the long term 
the success of our business will rely on the continued improvement of the web as a convenient means of customer interaction and commerce  as well as an efficient medium for the delivery and distribution of information by businesses to their employees 
if increases in web usage or the continued growth in reliability and capacity of the internet fail to materialize  our ability to deliver our services may be adversely affected and our operating results could suffer 
many of our customers and distribution partners are high technology companies or in the internet industry which may face financial problems in a slowing or down economy 
economic growth has slowed significantly  and some analysts believe the united states economy is experiencing and will continue to experience a recession 
in addition  the recent terrorists attacks in the united states may further add to the decline in the united states economy 
in particular  some of the companies that buy or resell or that are likely to buy or resell our services are high technology companies or are in the internet industry which may face financial problems related to economic conditions or other factors 
if economic conditions deteriorate as a result of economic  political or social turmoil  or if there are further terrorist attacks in the united states or elsewhere  our customers may not be able to pay for our services and our distribution partners may cease operations  which may harm our operating results 
we may experience power blackouts and higher electricity prices as a result of energy shortages or electrical system failures  which could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in  california experienced increased energy prices  energy shortages  and blackouts 
we rely on the major northern california public utility  pacific gas electric company  or pg e  to supply electric power to our headquarters in northern california 
pg e has filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy act 
if power outages or energy price increases occur in the future in california or other locations where we maintain operations  such events could disrupt our operations  prevent us from providing our services  harm our reputation  and result in a loss of revenue and increase in our expenses  all of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile  and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price you paid 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
for example  between january  and december   our stock price has traded as high as on november   and as low as on march  our stock price could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including variations in our actual or anticipated operating results  sales of substantial amounts of our stock  announcements about us or about our competitors  including technological innovation or new products or services  litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  conditions in the internet industry  governmental regulation and legislation  and changes in securities analysts estimates of our performance  or our failure to meet analysts expectations 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for internet technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations recently 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market prices of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could affect our financial performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we have recently begun selling our services outside the united states 
these services are generally priced in the local currency 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
when the amount of revenue obtained from sources outside the united states becomes significant  we may engage in hedging activities or other actions to decrease fluctuations in operating results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or market risk sensitive instruments 
instead  we invest in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of less than three months at date of purchase 
accordingly  we do not expect any material loss from these investments and believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material
