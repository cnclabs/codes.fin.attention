item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a major regional closeout retailer 
the company sells quality  value oriented consumer products at a broad range of price points offered at a substantial discount to the original retail or wholesale price 
the company s merchandise primarily consists of new  frequently brand name  products that are available to the company for a variety of reasons  including overstock positions of a manufacturer  wholesaler or retailer  the discontinuance of merchandise due to a change in style  color  shape or repackaging  a decrease in demand for a product through traditional channels  or the termination of business by a manufacturer  wholesaler or retailer 
the company was founded in as a wholesaler of closeout merchandise 
in fiscal  the company purchased the established odd job retail business  consisting of retail stores and a warehouse and distribution facility 
the company s business strategy has expanded from a primary focus on wholesale operations to an emphasis on the growth of its retail operations 
at the end of fiscal  the company operated closeout retail stores  including in new york eight of which are in manhattan  in new jersey  in ohio  in pennsylvania  in michigan  in connecticut  and each in delaware and kentucky 
in fiscal  the company opened no new stores to allow management to focus its efforts on improving the return on its existing retail locations 
in fiscal  the company s board of directors approved the termination of vcm  ltd  the joint venture owned with value city department stores  inc  and the sale of the wholesale division 
as a result of the vcm termination  the company received approximately million for its ownership and million in management fees for fiscal the proceeds received prior to february  were used by the company at that time to paydown its debt under the revolving credit facility 
subsequent to fiscal year end  the company paid off all term loans 
on february   the company effected the sale of its wholesale division and received cash proceeds at that time of approximately million 
although the proceeds were not recorded at the company s february  year end  they were subsequently used to payoff the remaining debt on the company s revolving credit facility 
as a result of the divestiture of the wholesale division  the company has now repositioned itself solely as a closeout retailer 
the company has consolidated management  buying and administrative functions to its south plainfield nj  corporate office 
during the fourth quarter  this strategic repositioning resulted in a million charge  net of tax 
this charge  reported as discontinued operations  represents sale related costs  including severance  legal and professional expenses 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies include the following valuation of inventory  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of goodwill valuation of inventory 
the company uses the retail method of accounting 
inventories are not recorded in excess of market value 
management tracks the inventory for changes in circumstances  such as changes in customer merchandise preference  which could cause the company s inventory to be exposed to obsolescence or slow moving merchandise 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the company s financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
if the company assesses the recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
the company considers projections of future taxable income  reversals of deferred tax liabilities and amounts available for carryback in arriving at a valuation allowance 
valuation of goodwill 
the company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining useful life of any goodwill may warrant revision or that the remaining balance might not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company uses an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows generated by the underlying assets to determine if a write down is required 
if a write down is required  the company adjusts the book value of the underlying goodwill to fair value 
the related charges are recorded as an asset impairment in the consolidated statements of operations

will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets

 sfas no 
significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale

are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows
