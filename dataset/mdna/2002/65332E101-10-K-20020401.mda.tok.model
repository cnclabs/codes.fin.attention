item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  the company enacted a restructuring plan to exit the technology consulting business and human capital consulting business and to focus on the strength of its economic consulting business 
the technology consulting business was completely exited in the second half of  primarily through the termination of consultants upon the completion of existing contracts and  to a lesser extent  the assignment of contracts and the workforce associated with those contracts to a third party 
the human capital consulting business was sold to a third party on january  upon the disposition of the human capital consulting business  the company consists of lexecon  one of the world s preeminent economics consulting firms 
the company generates net revenues by providing economic consulting services primarily under time and materials including charges for use of its computer system  and to a much lesser extent  fixed price or capped fee billing arrangements 
under time and materials billing arrangements  revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues on fixed price and capped fee contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting and are adjusted monthly for the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates 
we determine the percentage of completion of our contracts by comparing costs incurred to date to total estimated costs 
contract costs include direct labor and expenses related to performance of the contract 
we believe that the majority of our work will continue to be performed under time and materials billing arrangements 
net revenues exclude reimbursable expenses charged to clients  however  due to recently issued accounting guidance  reimbursable expenses will be included in net revenues effective january  we typically bill on a monthly basis to monitor client satisfaction and manage our outstanding accounts receivable balances 
our net revenues are substantially derived from clients located in the united states 
gross profit is derived from net revenues less the cost of revenues  which includes salaries  bonuses and benefits paid to consultants 
our financial performance is primarily based upon billing margin billable daily rate less the consultant s daily cost and personnel utilization rates billable days divided by paid days 
we monitor our engagements to manage billing and utilization rates 
we derive a substantial majority of our net revenues from engagements billed on a time and materials basis 
generally  clients are billed for expenses incurred by us on the clients behalf 
in addition  we closely monitor and attempt to control expenses that are not passed through to our clients 
incentive compensation expenses paid to consultants have a large variable component relating to net revenues and profit and  therefore  vary based upon our ability to achieve our operating objectives 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and benefits of certain senior management and other administrative personnel and training  marketing and promotional costs 
these expenses are associated with our development of new business and with our management  finance  recruiting  marketing and administrative activities 
incentive compensation expenses for certain senior management also have a significant variable component relating to net revenues and profit and  therefore  vary based upon our ability to achieve our operating objectives 
our tax provisions historically vary from the federal statutory rate of predominately due to valuation allowance adjustments  nondeductible goodwill amortization  state and local taxes and nondeductible meal expenses 
sale of human capital consulting business effective january   the company sold substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of its human capital consulting business to a privately held benefits  compensation and human resources consulting firm  for a total of million in cash excluding million subject to a working capital adjustment and the potential for up to an additional million based on future operating results over the next two years

the amended senior credit facility contains covenants related to the maintenance of financial ratios  operating restrictions  restrictions on the payment of dividends and disposition of assets 
the revised covenants were based on the company s operating plan for and the following summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity 
contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years senior credit facility debentures due to affiliates long term debt and capital leases operating leases total contractual obligations other commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands total amounts committed less than year years years after years standby letter of credit 
the senior credit facility payments due less than year includes million of debt payments made in connection with the proceeds from the sale of sibson and million of debt amortization in in accordance with the terms of the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility  debentures due to affiliates  long term debt and capital leases  and operating leases are explained in detail in notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
new accounting standards refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the company s consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial position 

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to restructuring charges  the realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  deferred tax assets  debt covenants  and intangible assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies  based on significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements restructuring charges 
the company has recorded significant restructuring charges over the past year and as of december   has million of restructuring reserves recorded on the balance sheet 
substantially most of these reserves relate to the cost of exiting certain leased facilities 
the reserves have been estimated based on the remaining term of the leases and assumptions as to the company s ability to sublease the space at current market rates or enact a buyout of the company s obligation 
should the company be successful in exiting the lease obligations prior to their scheduled expiration date or if subleasing assumptions change due to economic conditions in the real estate market  the restructuring reserves could vary significantly 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of circumstances regarding a specific customer s ability or intention to not meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to the company to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on a three year historical experience 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have approximately million of deferred tax assets related principally to domestic loss carryforwards that expire in  for which a valuation allowance has been recorded 
the realization of these assets is based upon estimates of future taxable income 
due to the company s three year cumulative loss position  the company is unable to recognize such assets as of december  under generally accepted accounting principles 
the valuation allowance will be reviewed periodically to determine its appropriateness 
debt covenants 
the company s debt agreements require the company to maintain certain financial ratios as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the covenants are measured quarterly and have been set at varying rates  the most restrictive at approximately below the company s projected operating results 
if the results of operations significantly decline below projected results and we are unable to obtain a waiver from the company s senior lenders  the company s debt would be in default and callable by the senior lenders 
it is the company s belief that the results of operations will achieve projections for the year ending december  and thereafter and the likelihood of our defaulting on our debt covenants is unlikely  absent any material negative event affecting the us economy as a whole 
we also believe our lenders would provide us waivers if necessary 
however  our expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with our debt covenants cannot be assured and our lenders actions are not controllable by us 
if our projections of future operating results are not achieved and our debt is placed in default  we would experience a material adverse impact on our reported financial position and results of operations 

table of contents intangible assets 
we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our senior credit facility 
we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the interest rate yield curve would not have a material adverse effect on interest sensitive financial instruments at december  foreign currency risk currently  the majority of the company s sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while the company is conducting some transactions in foreign currencies  no significant foreign exchange gains or losses are anticipated 
the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date
