table of contents we review long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that impairment indicators were present and therefore evaluated the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the evaluation was based on a cash flow forecast for five years ending june   and discounted at the rate of  which represented our estimated weighted average cost of capital 
as a result of the evaluation  we concluded that the book value of long lived assets exceeded fair value by million and accordingly  this amount was charged to operations as impairment of long lived assets in the fourth quarter of egain was founded in september from inception to september  egain s operating activities related primarily to planning and developing its proprietary technological solutions  recruiting personnel  raising capital and purchasing operating assets

in addition  egain has incurred significant losses since its inception and had an accumulated deficit of million as of june  egain has not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of its business and limited operating history  egain believes that period to period comparisons of its revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  long lived assets and restructuring 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from three sources  hosting fees  license fees and services 
services include software maintenance and support  training and system implementation consulting 
maintenance and support consists of technical support and software upgrades and enhancements 
significant management judgments and estimates are made and used to determine the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
we apply the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
we recognize license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  no significant obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we use the residual method under which revenue is allocated to the undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of such undelivered elements 
the residual amount of revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue 
such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services 
we recognize hosting services revenue ratably over the period of the agreement as services are provided 
hosting agreements are typically for a period of one year and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement 
we use a signed software license and services agreement and order form as evidence of an arrangement for sales of software  hosting  maintenance and support 
we use a signed engagement letter to evidence an arrangement for system implementation consulting and training 
software is delivered to customers electronically or on a cd rom 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
our standard payment terms are generally less than days 
in instances where payments are subject to extended payment terms  revenue is deferred until payments become due 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the revenue and recognize it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
if an acceptance period is required  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
when licenses are sold together with consulting and implementation services  license fees are recognized upon shipment  provided that the above criteria have been met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the consulting and implementation services  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
for arrangements that do not meet the above criteria  both the product license revenues and services revenues are recognized in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
when reliable estimates are available for the costs and efforts necessary to complete the implementation services  we account for the arrangements under the percentage of completion method pursuant to sop when such estimates are not available  the completed contract method is utilized 

table of contents the majority of our consulting and implementation services qualify for separate accounting 
we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the services and maintenance to account for the arrangement using the residual method  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
our consulting and implementation service contracts are bid either on a fixed fee basis or on a time and materials basis 
for a fixed fee contract  we recognize revenue upon completion of specific contractual milestones or using the percentage of completion method 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenue as services are performed 
maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is typically one year 
training revenue is recognized when training is provided 
revenue from sales to resellers are recognized either upon delivery to the reseller or on a sell through basis  depending on the facts and circumstances of the transaction  such as our understanding of the reseller s use of our software  the reseller s financial status and our past experience with the particular reseller 
accordingly the decision whether to recognize revenue to resellers either upon delivery or on a sell through basis requires significant management judgement 
this judgement can materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 
valuation of long lived assets we periodically review long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to these assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
significant assumptions and estimates include the projected cash flows based upon estimated revenue and expense growth rates and the discount rate applied to expected cash flows 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
restructuring we have taken restructuring charges related to excess facilities and have established reserves at the low end of the range of estimable cost as required by accounting standards against outstanding commitments for leased properties that we have abandoned 
these reserves are based upon our estimate of triggering events  such as the time required to sublease the property and the amount of sublease income that might be generated from the date of abandonment and the expiration of the lease 
these estimates are reviewed based on changes in these triggering events 
adjustments to the restructuring charge will be made in future periods  if necessary  should different conditions prevail from those anticipated in our original estimate 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential uncollectible trade receivables 
we review our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues 
we exercise judgment when determining the adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt trends  general economic conditions in the us and internationally  and changes in customer financial conditions 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences may result in additional reserves for trade receivables  which would be reflected by charges in general and administrative expenses for any period presented

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since inception egain experienced substantial expenditures as it grew operations and personnel 
although over the last fiscal year egain has repeatedly taken actions to reduce its expense rates  it expects to incur additional operating losses  at least through the second quarter of fiscal if not longer 
egain s working capital requirements in the foreseeable future will depend on a variety of factors and assumptions  in particular that revenue growth rates remain stable and that customers continue to pay on a timely basis  and is subject to numerous risks 
if egain does not significantly reduce its net cash outflow in the near term  as compared to fiscal  egain will require additional credit facilities  additional equity and or debt financings and or will need to pursue strategic alternatives in fiscal year egain is currently focused on reducing its expenses and pursuing such alternatives in the near term  and or will need to pursue strategic alternatives

table of contents factors that may affect future results egain expects continuing losses and may never achieve profitability  which in turn may harm its future operating performance and may cause the market price of egain common stock to decline egain incurred a net loss of million for the year ended june  as of june   egain had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
egain does not know when or if it will become profitable 
if egain does not become profitable within the timeframe expected by financial analysts or investors  the market price of egain common stock may decline 
even if egain does achieve profitability  it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in the future 
egain s revenue and operating expenses may fluctuate as egain builds its business  and this increase may harm its operating results and financial condition egain has spent heavily on technology and infrastructure development 
egain expects to continue to spend substantial financial and other resources on developing and introducing product and service offerings 
accordingly  if egain s revenue does not correspondingly increase  its business and operating results could suffer 
egain was incorporated in september and shipped its first product in september because of this limited operating history and other factors  egain s quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict 
in addition  due to the emerging nature of the eservice market and other factors  egain s revenue and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
it is possible that egain s operating results in some quarters will be below the expectations of financial analysts or investors 
in this event  the market price of egain s common stock is likely to decline 
a number of factors are likely to cause fluctuations in egain s operating results  including  but not limited to  the following the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding growth rate of ecommerce  demand for eservice software solutions  competitive pressure from new and existing market participants  egain s ability to attract and retain customers and maintain customer satisfaction  egain s ability to upgrade  develop and maintain its systems and infrastructure  egain s ability to develop new products and services  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to egain s business and infrastructure  technical difficulties or system outages  egain s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with software and internet industry expertise  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products and services by egain s competitors  changes in egain s pricing policies and those of its competitors  litigation relating to proprietary rights  seasonal trends in technology purchases  timing and revenue recognition of large customer contracts  changes in market conditions limiting egain s ability to raise capital  
table of contents general business conditions in the industry  failure to increase egain s north american and international sales  and governmental regulation regarding the internet and ecommerce in particular 
egain bases its expense levels in part on its expectations regarding future revenue levels 
in the short term  egain s expenses are generally fixed and if egain s revenue for a particular quarter is lower than it expects  it may be unable to proportionately reduce its operating expenses for that quarter 
period to period comparisons of egain s operating results may not be a good indication of its future performance 
like all companies  egain s business is linked to the health of the us and international economies 
economic growth has slowed significantly  and spending for enterprise software has weakened considerably over the past eighteen months 
at this time  it is difficult to predict if and when the market for egain products and services will show a meaningful and sustained recovery 
in addition  the threat of additional terrorist attacks and the related possibility for international hostilities create additional uncertainty that it could materially affect egain s business and results of operations 
egain must compete successfully in its market segment the market for eservice software remains relatively new and intensely competitive 
other than product development  there are no substantial barriers to entry in this market  and established or new entities may enter this market in the near future 
egain competes with companies that develop and maintain internally developed eservice software applications 
egain also competes directly with companies that provide licensed eservice software  including askjeeves  inc  avaya  inc  e 
piphany  inc  firepond  inc  genesys telecommunications a wholly owned subsidiary of alcatel  kana software  inc  primus knowledge solutions  inc  rightnow technologies  inc  serviceware  and talisma corp 
egain also faces actual or potential competition from larger  front office software companies such as amdocs limited which recently acquired the clarify  inc business from nortel networks  onyx software corporation  peoplesoft  inc  pivotal corp  and siebel systems  inc furthermore  established enterprise software companies  including ibm  microsoft corporation  oracle corporation  sap  inc  and similar companies  may seek to leverage their existing relationships and capabilities to offer eservice solutions 
egain believes competition will increase as its current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market 
many of egain s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition  more diversified lines of products and services  and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources 
these competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  more established and better financed companies 
these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and make more attractive offers to businesses to induce them to use their products or services 
further  any delays in the general market acceptance of egain s eservice applications would likely harm its competitive position 
any delay would allow egain s competitors additional time to improve their eservice 
table of contents product offerings  and also provide time for new competitors to develop eservice applications and solicit prospective customers within egain s target markets 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced operating margins and loss of market share 
egain may need additional capital  and raising additional capital may be difficult or impossible and will likely dilute existing stockholders since inception egain experienced substantial expenditures as it grew operations and personnel 
although over the last fiscal year egain has repeatedly taken actions to reduce its expense rates  it expects to incur additional operating losses  at least through the second quarter of fiscal if not longer 
egain s working capital requirements in the foreseeable future will depend on a variety of factors and assumptions  in particular that revenue growth rates remain stable and that customers continue to pay on a timely basis  and is subject to numerous risks 
if egain does not significantly reduce its net cash outflow in the near term  as compared to fiscal  egain will require additional credit facilities  additional equity and or debt financings and or will need to pursue strategic alternatives in fiscal year egain is currently focused on reducing its expenses and pursuing such alternatives in the near term 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  egain stockholders may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or at all  or that if available  such financing will be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if such financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  egain may be unable to meet operating obligations 
in addition  egain s working capital requirements could be adversely affected if it is unable to meet certain financial covenants contained in a commercial credit agreement between egain and silicon valley bank 
as of june   egain had borrowed approximately million under the loan agreement 
as of june   egain was in compliance with these financial covenants  as amended 
however  there can be no assurance that egain will be in compliance with its covenants in future months 
in the event egain is in default of its covenants  the bank could require egain to repay all or a portion of the total borrowings outstanding on an accelerated basis  which would seriously impair egain s operating cash requirements and overall financial position 
failure to comply with nasdaq s listing standards could result in egain s common stock being delisted from the nasdaq national market and adversely affect the market for stock on may   egain received a letter from nasdaq indicating that our common stock had failed to maintain a minimum bid price of per share for consecutive business days  and that we need to comply with the requirements for continued listing within calendar days from such notification or face the possibility of being delisted from the nasdaq national market 
on august   egain received another letter from nasdaq indicating that egain s common stock had failed to achieve compliance with the per share minimum bid price and that the common stock was therefore subject to delisting 
on august   egain issued a press release announcing receipt of this letter from nasdaq and egain s intention to appeal the delisting determination of the nasdaq staff 
egain currently has a hearing date set before a listing qualifications hearing panel 
at the hearing  scheduled for october  egain intends to present its plan for achieving compliance with the nasdaq listing requirements 
if egain s common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  it would adversely affect the liquidity and trading price of its common stock 
in addition  egain s ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities would be impaired 
likewise  measures egain may decide to pursue in order to avoid being delisted could cause the value of its common stock to decrease 

table of contents egain s cost reduction initiatives may adversely affect the morale and performance of egain s personnel and its ability to hire new personnel in connection with egain s effort to streamline operations and reduce costs to better align operating costs and expenses with revenue trends  egain has been restructuring its organization for the past several quarters  resulting in substantial reductions in egain s workforce 
egain also reduced its employees salaries in the quarter ended december  in order to reduce operating expenses 
egain s reductions in workforce and salary levels may reduce employee morale and may create concern among existing employees about job security  which may lead to attrition beyond egain s planned workforce reductions and reduce egain s ability to meet the needs of its current and future customers 
in addition  many of the employees who were terminated possessed specific knowledge or expertise that may prove to have been important to egain s operations 
in that case  their absence may create significant difficulties 
this personnel reduction may also subject egain to the risk of litigation  which may adversely impact egain s ability to conduct its operations and may cause egain to incur significant expense 
egain must recruit and retain its key employees to expand its business egain s success will depend on the skills  experience and performance of egain s senior management  engineering  sales  marketing and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of egain s senior management or other key personnel  including egain s chief executive officer and co founder  ashutosh roy  and egain s president and co founder  gunjan sinha  could harm its business 
egain recently underwent a transition at the chief financial officer position  and while egain believes that it has an effective transition plan in place  the loss of such a significant member of its management team presents significant challenges and risks 
in addition  egain does not have employment agreements with  or life insurance policies on  most of its key employees 
most of these employees may terminate their employment with egain at any time 
egain s success also will depend on its ability to recruit  retain and motivate other highly skilled engineering  sales  marketing and other personnel 
if egain fails to retain and recruit necessary engineering  sales and marketing  customer support or other personnel  egain s business and its ability to develop new products and services and to provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer 
in addition  companies in the software industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
egain could incur substantial costs in defending itself against any of these claims  regardless of the merits of such claims 
if egain fails to expand its sales activities  it may be unable to expand its business if egain does not successfully expand its sales activities  egain may not be able to expand its business  and egain s common stock price could decline 
the complexity of egain s eservice platform and related products and services requires it to have highly trained sales personnel to educate prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of egain s products and services as well as provide effective customer support 
with egain s relatively brief operating history and its plans for future growth  egain has considerable need to train and retain qualified sales staff 
any delays or difficulties egain encounters in these staffing efforts could impair its ability to attract new customers and enhance its relationships with existing customers 
this in turn would adversely affect the timing and extent of egain s revenue 
because many of egain s current sales personnel have recently joined egain and have limited experience working together  egain s sales organization may not be able to compete successfully against bigger and more experienced competing organizations 
egain s failure to expand third party distribution channels would impede its revenue growth to increase its revenue  egain must increase the number of its marketing and distribution partners  including software and hardware vendors and resellers 
egain s existing or future marketing and distribution partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of competitors which could also harm egain 
egain s failure to expand third party distribution channels would impede its revenue growth 

table of contents similarly  to increase its revenue and implementation capabilities  egain must develop and expand relationships with systems integrators 
egain relies on systems integrators to recommend egain s products to their customers and to install and support egain s products for their customers 
systems integrators may develop  market or recommend software applications that compete with egain s products 
moreover  if these firms fail to implement egain s products successfully for their customers  egain may not have the resources to implement its products on the schedule required by their customers 
due to the lengthy sales cycles of some of egain s products  the timing of its sales is difficult to predict and may cause egain to miss its revenue targets the long sales cycle for egain s products may cause license revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
egain s sales cycle for its products can be six months or more and varies substantially from customer to customer 
while egain s potential customers are evaluating egain s products before executing definitive agreements  egain may incur substantial expenses and spend significant management effort in connection with the potential customer 
egain s multi product offering and the increasingly complex needs of its customers contribute to a longer and unpredictable sales cycle 
consequently  egain faces difficulty predicting the quarter in which expected sales will actually occur 
this contributes to the uncertainty and fluctuations in egain s future operating results 
in addition  the recent economic slowdown in north america may cause potential customers to delay or cancel major information technology purchasing decisions 
if this slowdown continues  egain s average sales cycle could increase and  in some cases  prevent deals from closing that egain has been forecasting as likely to close 
consequently  egain may not meet its revenue forecast and may incur significant expenses that are not offset by corresponding revenue 
difficulties in implementing egain s products could harm our revenues and margins egain generally recognizes revenue from a customer sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the arrangement does not involve significant customization of the software  the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is probable 
if an arrangement requires significant customization or implementation services from egain  recognition of the associated license and service revenue could be delayed 
the timing of the commencement and completion of the these services is subject to factors that may be beyond egain s control  as this process requires access to the customer s facilities and coordination with the customer s personnel after delivery of the software 
in addition  customers could delay product implementations 
implementation typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and communications systems 
if egain experiences difficulties with implementation or does not meet project milestones in a timely manner  egain could be obligated to devote more customer support  engineering and other resources to a particular project 
some customers may also require egain to develop customized features or capabilities 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying egain s products or require significant amounts of egain professional services support or customized features  revenue recognition could be further delayed or canceled and egain s costs could increase  causing increased variability in egain s operating results 
egain s business is premised on an emerging business model that is not fully tested egain s business is premised on business assumptions that are still evolving 
historically  customer service has been conducted primarily in person or over the telephone 
egain s business model assumes that both customers and companies will increasingly elect to communicate via the internet assisted and unassisted online service  as well as demanding integration of the online channels into the traditional telephone based call center 
egain s business model also assumes that many companies recognize the benefits of a hosted delivery model and will seek to have their eservice applications hosted by egain 
if any of these assumptions is incorrect  egain s business will be seriously harmed 
egain depends on broad market acceptance of eservice applications egain depends on the widespread acceptance and use of eservice applications as an effective solution for businesses seeking to manage high volumes of customer communication over the internet while providing 
table of contents improved customer service 
egain cannot estimate the size or growth rate of the potential market for its product and service offerings  and does not know whether its products and services will achieve broad market acceptance 
the market for eservice software is new and rapidly evolving  and concerns over the security and reliability of online transactions  the privacy of users and quality of service or other issues may inhibit the growth of the internet and commercial online services 
if the market for eservice applications fails to grow or grows more slowly than egain currently anticipates  its business will be seriously harmed 
egain may not be able to upgrade its systems and hosted operations to accommodate growth egain faces risks related to the ability of its hosted operations to accommodate higher activity levels while maintaining expected performance 
as the volume and complexity of online customer communications increase  egain will need to expand its systems and hosted network infrastructure 
the expansion and adaptation of egain s network infrastructure will require financial  operational and management resources 
customer demand for egain s products and services could be greatly reduced if egain fails to maintain high capacity data transmission 
in addition  as egain upgrades its network  egain is likely to encounter equipment or software incompatibility 
egain may not be able to expand or adapt its hosted operations to meet additional demand or egain s customers changing requirements in a timely manner or at all 
unplanned system interruptions and capacity constraints could reduce egain s ability to provide hosting services and could harm its business and reputation egain s customers have in the past experienced some interruptions with the egain hosted operations 
egain believes that these interruptions will continue to occur from time to time 
these interruptions could be due to hardware and operating system failures 
egain expects a significant portion of its revenue to be derived from customers who use the hosted operations 
as a result  egain s business will suffer if it experiences frequent or long system interruptions that result in the unavailability or reduced performance of its hosted operations or reduce egain s ability to provide remote management services 
egain expects to experience occasional temporary capacity constraints due to sharply increased traffic  which may cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  impaired quality and degradation in levels of customer service 
if this were to continue to happen  egain s business and reputation could be seriously harmed 
egain s success largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and network systems 
most of egain s computer and communications systems are located in sunnyvale  california 
egain s systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and similar events 
egain has entered into service agreements with some of its customers that require minimum performance standards  including standards regarding the availability and response time of egain s remote management services 
if egain fails to meet these standards  egain s customers could terminate their relationships with egain  and egain could be subject to contractual monetary penalties 
any unplanned interruption of services may harm egain s ability to attract and retain customers 
egain may be liable for activities of its customers or others using egain s hosted operations as a provider of eservice software for the internet  egain faces potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the actions of egain customers or others using egain solutions 
this liability could result from the nature and content of the communications transmitted by egain customers through the hosted operations 
egain does not and cannot screen all of the communications generated by its customers  and egain could be exposed to liability with respect to this content 
furthermore  some foreign governments have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the internet that are more strict than those currently in place in the united states 

table of contents if egain s system security is breached  egain s business and reputation could suffer a fundamental requirement for online communications and transactions is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
third parties may attempt to breach egain s security or that of egain s customers 
egain may be liable to its customers for any breach in its security and any breach could harm its business and reputation 
although egain has implemented network security measures  egain s servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
egain may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to license encryption technology and additional technologies to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
egain may be unable to develop or enhance products or services that address the changing needs of the eservice market to be competitive in the eservice market  egain must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of egain products and services  including egain s existing eservice product suite  and develop new products  services  functionality and technology that address changing industry standards and customer needs 
if egain cannot bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely and effective way  its business and operating results will suffer 
more generally  if egain cannot adapt or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to changing industry standards  market conditions or customer requirements  egain s business and operating results will suffer 
unknown software defects could disrupt egain s products and services  which could harm egain s business and reputation egain s product and service offerings depend on complex software  both internally developed and licensed from third parties 
complex software often contains defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
egain may not discover software defects that affect its new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
it is possible that  despite testing by egain  defects may occur in the software 
these defects could result in damage to egain s reputation  lost sales  product liability claims  delays in or loss of market acceptance of egain s products  product returns and unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 
problems arising from use of egain s products with other vendors products could cause egain to incur significant costs  divert attention from egain s product development efforts and cause customer relations problems egain s customers generally use egain products together with products from other companies 
as a result  when problems occur in the network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
even when egain s products do not cause these problems  these problems may cause egain to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of egain s engineering personnel from product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
egain may need to license third party technologies and may be unable to do so to the extent egain needs to license third party technologies  it may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  egain may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into its products or services 
third party licenses may expose egain to increased risks  including risks associated with the integration of new technology  the diversion of resources from the development of egain s own proprietary technology  and egain s inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs 
egain s inability to obtain and successfully integrate any of these licenses could delay product and service development until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed and integrated 
this in turn would harm egain s business and operating results 

table of contents egain may be unable to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights egain regards its patents  copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to its success  and relies on trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with egain employees  customers and partners to protect its proprietary rights 
egain has numerous registered trademarks and trademark applications pending in the united states and internationally  as well as common law trademark rights 
in addition  egain owns several patents in the area of case based reasoning  and has patents pending relating to various technologies 
egain will seek additional trademark and patent protection in the future 
egain does not know if its trademark and patent applications will be granted  or whether they will provide the protection egain desires  or whether they will subsequently be challenged or invalidated 
it is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology  particularly in foreign countries  where the laws may not protect egain s proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
furthermore  egain s competitors may independently develop technology similar to egain s technology 
despite egain s efforts to protect its proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use egain s products or technology 
these precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of egain s intellectual property 
in addition  egain routinely requires its employees  customers  and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements before egain will disclose any sensitive aspects of its products  technology  or business plans 
in addition  egain requires employees to agree to surrender to egain any proprietary information  inventions or other intellectual property they generate or come to possess while employed by egain 
in addition  some of egain s license agreements with certain customers and partners require egain to place the source code for its products into escrow 
these agreements typically provide that some party will have a limited  non exclusive right to access and use this code as authorized by the license agreement if there is a bankruptcy proceeding instituted by or against egain  or if egain materially breaches a contractual commitment to provide support and maintenance to the party 
egain may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend third parties may infringe or misappropriate egain s copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  other parties may assert infringement claims against egain 
for example  egain has been contacted by a company that has suggested that egain may need to license certain patents held by this company 
although this company has not filed any claims against egain  egain cannot be sure that it or some other party will not do so in the future 
in addition  because the contents of patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to egain s software products 
egain may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of its business  including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running egain s business 
this litigation could also require egain to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  in the event of a successful claim of infringement 
egain s failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm its business 
egain may face liability associated with its management of sensitive customer information egain s applications manage sensitive customer information  and egain may be subject to claims associated with invasion of privacy or inappropriate disclosure  use or loss of this information 
any imposition of liability  particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage  could harm egain s reputation and its business and operating results 
egain may become involved in securities class action litigation which could divert management s attention and harm its business the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stocks of technology companies  particularly internet companies 

table of contents these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of egain common stock to decline 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
egain may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could harm egain business and operating results 
the conversion of egain s preferred shares and the exercise of the related warrants would result in a substantial number of additional shares being issued  which could result in a decline in the market price of egain s common stock on august   egain issued shares of non voting series a cumulative convertible preferred stock series a   stated value per share  and shares of non voting series b cumulative convertible preferred stock series b   stated value per share in a private placement to certain investors 
the series b shares automatically converted into series a shares upon stockholder approval on november  at the annual stockholders meeting 
in addition  the investors received warrants to purchase million shares of egain s common stock with a current warrant exercise price of per share 
the series a shares have a liquidation preference of  per share which increases on a daily basis at an annual rate of from august   compounded on a semi annual basis 
the series a shares are convertible into common stock including all amounts accreted from august  at a conversion price of per share 
by way of illustration  at the current conversion price of per share  the series a shares would be convertible into million shares of common stock 
to the extent the preferred shares are converted into common stock including all amounts accreted from august   a significant number of shares of common stock may be sold into the market  which could decrease the price of egain s common stock 
egain s stock price may be volatile the price at which egain common stock trades has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate substantially due to factors such as the following the prospect of a potential delisting order from the nasdaq national market  actual or anticipated fluctuations in egain s operating results  ability to meet announced or anticipated profitability goals  changes in or failure to meet securities analysts expectations  concerns related to liquidity or cash balances  announcements of technological innovations  introduction of new services by egain or its competitors  developments with respect to intellectual property rights  conditions and trends in the internet and other technology industries  and general market conditions 
egain may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute egain s existing stockholders  cause egain to incur significant expenses or harm its business egain may review acquisition or investment prospects that might complement its current business or enhance its technological capabilities 
integrating any newly acquired businesses or their technologies or products may be expensive and time consuming 
to finance any acquisitions  it may be necessary for egain to 
table of contents raise additional funds through public or private financings 
additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to egain  if at all  and  in the case of equity financings  may result in dilution to egain s existing stockholders 
egain may not be able to operate acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement its growth strategy successfully 
if egain is unable to integrate newly acquired entities or technologies effectively  egain s operating results could suffer 
future acquisitions by egain could also result in large and immediate write offs  the conversion of the company s preferred notes into common stock  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  or amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangibles  any of which could harm egain s operating results 
egain could incur additional non cash charges associated with stock based compensation arrangements egain s operating results may be impacted if it incurs significant non cash charges associated with stock based compensation arrangements with employees and non employees 
egain has issued options to non employees which are subject to various vesting schedules of up to months 
for deferred compensation purposes  non employee options are required to be remeasured at each vesting date  which may require egain to record additional non cash accounting expenses 
these expenses may result in egain incurring net losses or increased net losses for a given period  and this could seriously harm egain s operating results and common stock price 
egain will only be able to execute its business plan if internet usage continues to grow egain s business will be seriously harmed if internet usage does not continue to grow or grows at significantly lower rates compared to current trends 
the continued growth of the internet depends on various factors  most of which are outside egain s control 
these factors include the following the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it  the performance and reliability of the internet may decline as usage grows  security and authentication concerns with respect to transmission over the internet of confidential information  such as credit card numbers  and attempts by unauthorized computer users  so called hackers  to penetrate online security systems  and privacy concerns  including those related to the ability of web sites to gather user information without the user s knowledge or consent 
because egain provides its eservice software to companies conducting business over the internet  egain s business could suffer if efficient transmission of data over the internet is interrupted the recent growth in the use of the internet has caused frequent interruptions and delays in accessing the internet and transmitting data over the internet 
because egain provides internet based eservice software  interruptions or delays in internet transmissions will harm egain customers ability to receive and respond to online interactions 
therefore  egain s market depends on improvements being made to the entire internet infrastructure to alleviate overloading and congestion 
governmental regulation and legal uncertainties could impair the growth of the internet and decrease demand for egain s services or increase egain s cost of doing business governmental regulation may impair the growth of the internet or commercial online services 
this could decrease the demand for egain s products and services  increase its cost of doing business or otherwise harm its business and operating results 
although there are currently few laws and regulations directly applicable to the internet and the use of the internet as a commercial medium  a number of laws have been proposed involving the internet 
these proposed laws include laws addressing user privacy  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  antitrust  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
further  the growth and development of the 
table of contents market for commercial online transactions may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies engaged in ecommerce 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership  sales and other taxes  libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk egain develops products in the united states and india and sells these products internationally 
generally  sales are made in local currency 
as a result  egain s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues and operating expenses has not been material 
egain does not currently use derivative instruments to hedge against foreign exchange risk 
egain s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio 
egain s investments consist primarily of commercial paper and money market funds  which have an average fixed rate of to  and have maturities of three months or less 
egain does not consider its cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities
