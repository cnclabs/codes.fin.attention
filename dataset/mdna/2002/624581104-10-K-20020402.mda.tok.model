for fiscal  total revenues increased to million from million in fiscal the increase for the year was due primarily to a increase in same store revenues and an increase in the average number of stores open during fiscal versus fiscal the increase in same store revenues was the result of i significant increases in dvd rental revenue  ii an increase in the sales of previously viewed movies and previously played games  iii successful  chain wide internal marketing programs designed to generate more consumer excitement and traffic in our base of stores  iv a favorable new release schedule in the last half of the year  v an extra week of revenues totaling approximately million in fiscal  and vi additional revenues from the video update acquisition totaling approximately million in fiscal the revenue increase was partially offset by i soft game rentals through the third quarter of fiscal due to consumer anticipation of new game platforms being introduced late in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and ii a decline in new movie sales as a result of the liquidation of older sell through titles in certain stores during fiscal and into the first quarter of fiscal cost of sales 
the gross margin on rental revenue for fiscal was  versus in fiscal the cost of rental revenues includes both the amortization of rental inventory and revenue sharing expenses incurred 
the improvement in the gross margin on rental revenue is a result of the increase in same store revenues and the benefit of stronger margins on dvd rentals versus vhs rentals due to the difference in purchasing models for these two formats 
the increase was achieved inclusive of a million reserve against previously viewed vhs inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cost of product sales includes the unamortized value of previously viewed rental inventory sold during the period  as well as the costs of new vhs and dvd  confectionery items and other goods 
the gross margin on product sales increased to for fiscal from in fiscal the increase in profitability of product sales reflects the impact of the continuing promotion and availability of previously viewed movies with only limited levels of new sell through titles in inventory 
the increase was offset partially by significant discounting associated with the continued liquidation of older sell through titles and other slow moving inventory in certain stores early in the year 
operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses  which include store level expenses such as lease payments and in store payroll  decreased to of total revenue for fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to i the same store revenues increase of in fiscal  ii continued initiatives to reduce operating costs  iii strong performance of new stores  iv continued closure of under performing units  and v the benefits of an extra week of revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenses  which include a nonrecurring charge of million related to an amendment of our supply agreement with rentrak corporation in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements  represent of total revenue in fiscal excluding this nonrecurring charge  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to increased revenue levels  benefiting from an extra week of revenues in fiscal  with only minimal increases to administrative staffing levels 
amortization of intangibles as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the increase in revenue and the expiration of significant levels of five year non compete agreements throughout fiscal as well as lower impairment charges in fiscal versus fiscal effective in fiscal  amortization of intangibles will be significantly reduced due to the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
see recently issued accounting pronouncements 
stock option compensation expense represents the non cash charge associated with certain stock options that were repriced during the first quarter of fiscal and are subsequently accounted for as variable stock options under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the impact of the above factors on revenues and expenses  operating income increased by in fiscal to million 
excluding the nonrecurring charge to amend a supply contract and non cash stock compensation expense  operating income increased by for fiscal to million 
pending the completion of final closing tax returns for video update  we had net operating loss carryforwards at january  resulting from the video update acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements of approximately million for income taxes that expire in years through we have recorded a valuation allowance of million related to our net deferred tax assets as we are uncertain as to whether sufficient taxable income will be generated to allow the net deferred tax assets to be realized 
extraordinary loss 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred an extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt of  net of taxes of  or less than per diluted share 
the extraordinary loss consisted of unamortized debt issue costs associated with the previous credit facility and unamortized amounts associated with the termination of the interest rate swap agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended january  revenue 
total revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in same store revenues of  as well as a increase in the average number of stores open during fiscal versus fiscal the increase in same store revenues was primarily the result of i increased product availability for the customer  ii a strong slate of new title releases versus the prior year  especially in the fourth quarter where box office revenues on the titles released were approximately higher than the fourth quarter of  iii successful  chain wide internal marketing programs designed to generate more consumer excitement and traffic in our base of stores  iv an increase in the sale of previously viewed movies and previously played games  v the return of the christmas and new year s holidays to a weekday instead of a weekend day  as well as the absence of the millennium effect experienced in  and vi increases in other ancillary sales 
the revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in new movie sales as a result of fewer titles being released at sell through price points and a de emphasis on the sale of older sell through titles in certain stores 
cost of sales 
the gross margin on rental revenue for fiscal was  a slight decrease from in fiscal  primarily due to the significant concentration of product purchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal the cost of rental revenues includes both the amortization of rental inventory and revenue sharing expenses incurred 
cost of product sales includes the costs of new vhs and dvd  confectionery items and other goods  as well as the unamortized value of previously viewed rental inventory sold 
the gross margin on product sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in profitability of product sales is primarily the result of significant discounting in the fourth quarter for the holiday season and continued liquidation of older sell through titles in certain stores 
gross margins 
as a result of slightly lower margins on both rental revenues and product sales  total gross margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses  which include store level expenses such as lease payments and in store payroll  decreased to of total revenue for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in store operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the same store revenues increase in fiscal  as well as the centralization of certain functions at the general and administrative level  which have resulted in store level expense savings  and the continued focus on closure of underperforming stores 
amortization of intangibles decreased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal versus in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the increase in same store revenues in fiscal and a reduction in goodwill impairment write offs during fiscal required by fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal compared to for fiscal increases in general and administrative expenses due to increased staffing and travel costs associated with our new store development which began to intensify in the latter half of  as well as incremental expenses from the operation of our e commerce effort which was launched in september  were offset by revenue increases in fiscal as a result of the impact of the above factors on revenues and expenses  operating income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal for fiscal our effective income tax rate was  as compared to a effective rate for fiscal the decrease in the income tax rate in fiscal is primarily due to higher pre tax income which leverages certain permanently non deductible items  therefore reducing the effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs are for opening and acquiring new stores and for purchasing inventory 
other capital needs include refurbishing  remodeling and relocating existing stores 
we fund inventory purchases  remodeling and relocation programs  new store opening costs and acquisitions primarily from cash flow from operations and loans under revolving credit facilities 
during fiscal we generated approximately million in adjusted ebitda  a increase over the prior year 
for fiscal  our adjusted ebitda increased to million  a increase over million in fiscal these increases were primarily driven by the revenue increases during those periods while leveraging expenses as discussed above 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash compensation and nonrecurring items  less our purchases of rental inventory which excludes rental inventory purchases specifically for new store openings 
adjusted ebitda is presented not as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but because  in the home video specialty retail industry  it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to service debt 
we fund short term working capital needs  including the purchase of rental inventory  primarily through cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities continues to be sufficient to cover rental inventory replenishment  capital resource and debt service needs 
on june   we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  led by southtrust bank  with respect to a new revolving credit facility the facility 
this facility replaces a similar revolving credit facility with first union national bank of north carolina  which was due to expire on january  the new facility is unsecured and provides for borrowings of up to million through july   million through july  and million until final maturity on july  the interest rate on the new facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin percentage  which depends on cash flow generation and borrowings outstanding 
the terms of the new facility also required that we enter into a new interest rate swap agreement 
in december  the company entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with southtrust bank in order to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations on million of outstanding debt at a fixed rate of plus an applicable margin percentage 
we grow our store base through internally developed and acquired stores 
we opened internally developed stores during fiscal and remain on target to open approximately new stores in this follows a record of internally developed stores during fiscal in addition to new store development  we acquired stores during fiscal  including what we believe to be the largest single domestic acquisition in the industry s history as discussed below 
to the extent available  new stores and future acquisitions may be completed using funds available under the new facility  financing provided by sellers  alternative financing arrangements such as funds raised in public or private debt or equity offerings or shares of our stock issued to sellers 
however  we cannot assure you that financing will be available to us on terms which will be acceptable  if at all 
effective december   we acquired of the newly issued common stock of the reorganized video update  inc under its plan of reorganization which was confirmed by the united states bankruptcy court on december  video update had been operating under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code since its voluntary filing on september  the acquisition of the newly issued common stock of video update was in satisfaction of all amounts owed by video update under a million debtor in possession financing agreement between video update and movie gallery 
in addition  we purchased certain senior secured debt of video update in may for million  funded amounts due to secured and unsecured creditors in accordance with the confirmation of the plan of reorganization totaling approximately million  and assumed other post bankruptcy filing liabilities of video update 
video update operates over video specialty stores in the united states and canada  bringing our consolidated store count to over  stores in states and five canadian provinces 
we believe our acquisition of video update represents the largest single domestic acquisition in the history of the industry 
see note to the consolidated financial statements during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the million stock repurchase plan announced and begun in fiscal  and announced a second million stock repurchase plan which was completed in may during fiscal and fiscal  we repurchased and retired a total of million shares for approximately million  funded primarily through cash flow from operations 
at january   we had a working capital deficit of million  due to the accounting treatment of rental inventory 
rental inventory is treated as a noncurrent asset under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because it is a depreciable asset and a portion of this asset is not reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates the major portion of our revenue  the classification of this asset as noncurrent results in its exclusion from working capital 
the aggregate amount payable for this inventory  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  is included in working capital 
consequently  we believe that working capital is not an appropriate measure of our liquidity and we anticipate that we will continue to operate with a working capital deficit 
the following table discloses our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years credit facility outstanding   operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations     total contractual cash obligations      the total commercial commitment under the credit facility is million  with expiration as follows million in  million in and million in as of january   there were standby letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility of 
million which expire in we believe our projected cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity under the facility  cash on hand and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to fund our current plan of operations  including our anticipated new store openings and acquisition program  through at least fiscal however  to fund a major acquisition  or to provide funds in the event that our need for funds is greater than expected  or if certain of the financing sources identified above are not available to the extent anticipated or if we increase our growth plan  we may need to seek additional or alternative sources of financing 
this financing may not be available on satisfactory terms 
failure to obtain financing to fund our expansion plans or for other purposes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our ability to fund our current plan of operations  our growth plans and our debt service requirements will depend upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  fund capital resource needs and cover the ongoing costs of operating the business 
if we are unable to satisfy these requirements with cash flow from operations  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  to sell assets or to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any such refinancing would be available or that any such sales of assets or additional financing could be obtained 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates have been based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include our policies with respect to the recognition of extended viewing fee revenue  rental inventory amortization  impairment of long lived assets  purchase price allocation of acquired businesses and deferred income taxes 
we recognize revenue from extended viewing fees that we charge our customers for keeping our rental products beyond the initial rental period on a cash basis when the extended viewing fees are collected from the customer 
if we recognized extended viewing fee revenue on an accrual basis  results of operations would reflect increased income for extended viewing fee revenue offset by an accrual to reserve for uncollectible accounts 
rental inventory is amortized to an estimated salvage value over an estimated useful life of three years 
excess copies of rental inventory are sold as previously viewed product and the unamortized cost is charged to cost of sales 
we amortize the cost of rental inventory using an accelerated method designed to approximate the rate of revenue recognition 
we believe that the amortization rates  salvage values and useful lives are appropriate in our existing operating environment 
if revenue trends or other industry conditions change  we may make changes to the existing amortization policy that could result in a charge to write down the net book value of rental inventory 
we currently maintain a reserve against rental inventory to reduce the amortized cost of previously viewed vhs inventory to the estimated net realizable value 
we may adjust this reserve in future periods based on conditions in the market for previously viewed vhs inventory 
we assess the fair value and recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  we make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors to make our determination 
the fair value of our long lived assets and goodwill is dependent upon the forecasted performance of our business  changes in the video retail industry  the market valuation of our common stock and the overall economic environment 
when we determine that the carrying value of our long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon the excess of the carrying value that exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
as a result of this review  we recorded impairment losses of million and 
million in fiscal and  respectively 
if we do not meet our operating forecasts or if the market value of our stock declines significantly  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities of acquired businesses based on historical experience and available information at the acquisition date 
we engage independent valuation specialists to assist when necessary 
if information becomes available subsequent to the acquisition date that would materially impact the valuation of assets acquired or liabilities assumed in business combinations  we may be required to adjust the purchase price allocation 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review and the related video update acquisition  we have established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to the estimated utilization of the net operating losses 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method  and all intangible assets acquired in a business combination to be recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they meet certain contractual legal criterion or separability criterion 
the provisions of statement apply to all business combinations with an acquisition date subsequent to june  under statement  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
statement is effective for us as of january  we do not expect the adoption of statement to have any material impact on the classification of intangible assets 
application of the nonamortization provisions of statement will result in an increase in net income of approximately million per year 
we do not anticipate completion of the transitional impairment tests to result in any impairment charge 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations for disposal of a segment of a business 
statement is effective for us beginning january  and is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
with respect to forward looking statements  please refer to the disclosures set forth under cautionary statements in item above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the increased interest costs arising from adverse changes in interest rates primarily libor and prime bank rates 
in order to manage this risk  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes our interest rate exposure on million of the amount outstanding under the facility at plus an applicable margin percentage 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the libor interest rate and assuming debt levels outstanding as of january   we would incur an immaterial amount of additional annual interest expense on unhedged variable rate borrowings 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on our cost of borrowing 
the analysis does not consider the potential negative impact on overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
we believe that our exposure to adverse interest rate changes and the impact on our total cost of borrowing capital has been largely mitigated by the interest rate swap agreement that is in place 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risks associated with our canadian operations acquired in fiscal historically  the canadian exchange rates have been stable and we believe the impact of fluctuations in the currency exchange rates will be immaterial to our financial position and results of operations
