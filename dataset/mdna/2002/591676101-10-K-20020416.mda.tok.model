under the terms of the credit facility  the company secured a  term loan with maturities of  in   in and  and  in  and  respectively 
as of december   the balance outstanding was  in connection with the credit facility  the company secured a  revolving credit line  which expires in january proceeds from the credit facility were applied towards the financing of the acquisition of aoa  paying down the existing term loans and line of credit  and providing working capital for the company and its subsidiaries 
the company has granted a security interest in its assets and properties to the primary bank in favor of the banks as security for borrowings under the credit facility 
as of december   the balance outstanding was  under the credit facility  interest rates are based on libor or prime rate options based on the discretion of the company  plus spreads ranging from to as defined in the credit facility 
since september  the company has been in discussion with its banks with respect to modifying the credit facility 
as reflected in the company s quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   the company and its primary bank reached an agreement in principle with regard to converting the current revolving credit line to an asset based arrangement together with a revised term note and revised covenants 
subsequent to reaching an agreement in principle  the banks have requested additional terms 
the company and the banks are still in negotiations with respect to the terms of the new credit agreement and on april   the banks notified the company that it was in default under certain financial covenants contained in its credit facility 
as a result of the defaults  the company has classified all of its debt under the credit facility in the amount of approximately  as current on its balance sheet dated december  the company expects either to enter into an agreement with the banks for an asset based arrangement or to enter into a forbearance agreement  which will allow for sufficient time for the company to seek more competitive credit financing 
to assist the company in seeking alternative financing arrangements  the company has retained an investment bank and a consultant 
while management currently believes that it will be successful in either negotiating a new arrangement with its existing banks or finding acceptable financing alternatives  there can be no assurance that such arrangements will be obtained on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
if the company is able to enter into a new credit agreement or forbearance agreement  it expects to file an amendment to the form k together with an unqualified audit opinion from its auditors  and a reclassification of certain of its bank debt from short term liabilities to long term liabilities in the amount of approximately  under the terms of the credit facility and based upon the company s defaults thereunder  the company s current lenders have the authority to declare all of the debt under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable

if the company is unable to reach an agreement with its primary bank with respect to a new credit agreement or forbearance agreement or to enter into a credit agreement with another lender and its current lenders decide to declare the debt immediately due and payable  the company would be forced to sell company assets in order to generate sufficient cash to repay the debt 
while management currently believes that any sale of company assets would generate sufficient cash to repay the debt  there can be no assurance that such sales could be made in a timely manner or that such sales would generate adequate amounts of cash to repay the company s debt 
if the company is not able to generate sufficient cash to repay the debt  the banks could take possession of the collateral pledged as security for the debt under the credit facility and otherwise exercise the remedies available to them under the credit facility

the company s liquidity has been  and may continue to be  adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the brazilian real  the singapore dollar  and the chinese renminbi 
in an effort to mitigate the financial implications of the volatility in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar  the company has selectively entered into derivative financial instruments to offset its exposure to foreign currency risks 
derivative financial instruments may include i foreign currency forward exchange contracts with its primary bank for periods not exceeding six months  which partially hedge sales to the company s german subsidiary and ii euro based loans  which act as a partial hedge against outstanding intercompany receivables and the net assets of its european subsidiary  which are denominated in euros 
additionally  the company s european subsidiary invoices and receives payment in certain other major currencies  including the british pound  which results in an additional mitigating measure that reduces the company s exposure to the fluctuation between the euro and the us dollar although it does not offer protection against fluctuations of that currency against the us dollar 
the company s joint venture interests in metrologic eria iberica and metrologic eria france contain options for the company to purchase the remaining minority interests 
the purchase option is calculated based on a twelve month multiple of sales

euro conversion 
on january   several member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro traded on currency exchanges and the legacy currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  the countries that adopted the euro on january  are austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal  and spain 
during the transition period  non cash payments were made in the euro  and parties could elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or legacy currency 
between january  and january  the participating countries introduced euro notes and coins and withdrew all legacy currencies 
the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border transparency 
the company continues to evaluate its pricing marketing strategy in order to insure that it remains competitive in a broader european market 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in thousands market risk sensitive instruments 
the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
interest rate risk 
the company s bank loans expose earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are either variable or fixed for such a short period of time as to effectively become variable 
the fair values of the company s bank loans are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
the change in fair value of the company s long term debt resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates could have had an impact of approximately on the net earnings of the company 
foreign exchange risk 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  namely the euro  thereby mitigating the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
principal transactions hedged are intercompany sales and payments 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected in the company s statement of operations 
a large percentage of the company s foreign sales are transacted in foreign local currencies 
as a result  the company s international operating results are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical five percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against the euro could have had an impact of  on the net earnings of the company 
actual results may differ 
the company is subject to risk from fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar for its european subsidiary  which uses the euro as its functional currency and translated into us dollars in consolidation 
such changes result in cumulative translation adjustments which are included in other comprehensive income loss 
at december   the company had translation exposure 
the potential effect on other comprehensive income loss resulting from a hypothetical change in the quoted euro rate amounts to actual results may differ
