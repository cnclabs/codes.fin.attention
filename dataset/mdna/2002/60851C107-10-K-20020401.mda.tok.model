business business risks and qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk and the risks detailed from time to time in the company s sec reports  including this annual report on form k for the year ended december  molecular devices corporation is a leading supplier of high performance bioanalytical measurement systems that accelerate and improve drug discovery and other life sciences research 
molecular devices systems and consumables enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage advances in genomics  proteomics and combinatorial chemistry by facilitating the high throughput and cost effective identification and evaluation of drug candidates 
molecular devices solutions are based on its advanced core technologies that integrate its expertise in engineering  molecular and cell biology and chemistry 
molecular devices enables its customers to improve research productivity and effectiveness  which ultimately accelerates the complex process of discovering and developing new drugs 
molecular devices acquired all of the outstanding stock of ljl biosystems in a tax free  stock for stock transaction on august   as a result of which ljl biosystems became a wholly owned subsidiary of molecular devices 
the transaction was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting and  accordingly  all financial information includes the operations of ljl biosystems for all periods presented 
our customers include small and large pharmaceutical  biotechnology and industrial companies as well as medical centers  universities  government research laboratories and other institutions throughout the world 
no single customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues in we recognize revenue on the sale of our products  when collectibility is reasonably assured  at the time of shipment and transfer of title to customers and distributors 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part 
service contract revenue is deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably over the period of performance 
total service revenue was less than of total revenues for all periods prior to  and in in  sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of total revenues and total sales denominated in foreign currencies accounted for of total revenues 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  however we expect to do so in the future 
we typically experience a decrease in the level of sales in the first calendar quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year because of budgetary and capital equipment purchasing patterns in the life sciences industry 
we expect this trend to continue in future years 
we have not experienced any favorable or unfavorable trends or uncertainties related to the euro conversion 
costs incurred for system modifications have been  and are expected to be immaterial to the consolidated results of operations 
in  we acquired nihon molecular devices  a sales and service operation in japan  as well as cytion sa  a research and development facility in switzerland 
neither acquisition created a new operating segment of business 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of molecular devices financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  equity investments  income taxes and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and warranty we recognize product revenue at the time of product shipment and transfer of title either to a customer or to a distributor and provide for estimated warranty expense at the time of sale 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part 
shipping costs are charged to cost of goods sold 
amounts received prior to completion of the earnings process are recorded as customer deposits or deferred revenue  as appropriate 
service contract revenue is deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably over the period of performance 
accounts receivable we sell our products primarily to corporations  academic institutions  government entities and distributors within the drug discovery and life sciences research markets 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  which are based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the current financial condition of specific customers  payment trends and the overall economic environment 
such losses have been historically within management s expectations 
inventories inventories are stated on a first in  first out basis at the lower of cost or market 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including goodwill and investments accounted for under the cost method  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
for long lived assets  we would measure fair value based on discounted expected cash flows to be generated by such assets 
there were no long lived assets that were considered to be impaired during any period presented 
equity investments we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than percent and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
when our ownership exceeds percent but is less than percent  the investment is accounted for under the equity method 
under the equity method  the investee s proportionate share of net income or loss and amortization of the investee s net excess investment over its equity in net assets is included in net income or loss 
we regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the fair values 
we monitor the preceding factors to identify events or circumstances which would cause us to test for other than temporary impairment and revise our assumptions for the estimated recovery of equity investments 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized in the future 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million 
realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate significant future taxable income 
we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
we will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances periodically 
the elimination of the amortization of goodwill pursuant to the adoption of fas and will have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate in other factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects upon our effective tax rate in and subsequent years 
these factors include  but are not limited to  interpretations of existing tax laws  changes in tax laws and rates  future levels of r d spending  future levels of capital expenditures  and our success in r d and commercializing products 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated statement of income as a percentage of revenues years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit research and development acquired in process research and development merger expenses selling  general and administrative income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision net income loss pro forma operating income pro forma net income excludes the impact of the write off of acquired in process research and development in and and merger expenses recorded in  net of tax 
years ended december  and revenues for decreased by to million from million in the soft economic environment affecting purchasing decisions on our higher priced instrument systems drove this top line decline 
drug discovery product family revenues were down from  due in large part to significant declines in the ljl product line 
this decline was offset by a increase in revenues from our life sciences research product family  led by the flexstation  which was introduced in the first quarter of in contrast  in we saw strong contributions from both our life sciences research and drug discovery product families 
gross margin decreased to in  from in the decrease related in part from decreased list prices for our ljl product line  as well as increased discounting on other high cost instruments in an attempt to offset the impact of the soft economic environment 
research and development expenses for decreased to million from million in  or a decrease of 
the decrease was the result of a reduction in spending in response to our revised economic outlook  as well as synergies created by our merger with ljl biosystems  offset by increased spending related to our acquisition of cytion sa 
we do not believe the decreased spending has materially impacted any development projects 
in july  we acquired cytion sa and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated a portion of the purchase price to purchased in process technologies for million 
we wrote this off entirely in the third quarter of the write off of purchased in process technologies represented the fair value at the acquisition date  calculated utilizing the income approach  of the portion of certain in process research and development projects that were not reliant upon core technology 
the acquired in process research and development had no alternative future use at the date of acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in  or an increase of 
the increased spending for the period is primarily the result of additional spending on marketing  sales and service related activities as we continued our efforts to expand worldwide market coverage and introduce new products 
in  we purchased our japanese distributor  nihon molecular devices 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were in and in the increase from to was a result of the costs at our japanese subsidiary  as well as the decline in overall revenues 
other income net  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased by in to million from million in due to lower average cash and investment balances and the significant decline in interest rates in lower average cash balances result principally from an aggressive share repurchase plan under which we repurchased more than million shares of our common stock and our acquisition of cytion sa 
we recorded income tax provisions of million in and million in these provisions reflected a effective tax rate 
the effective tax rates for and are calculated on profit before tax excluding the write off of acquired in process research and development expenses in and merger expenses related to the ljl biosystems merger in  which are not deductible for income tax purposes 

table of contents years ended december  and revenues for increased by to million from million in in and  we saw strong contributions from both our life sciences research and drug discovery product families 
life sciences research revenues increased in primarily due to the worldwide strength of the spectramax plus and spectramax gemini xs  both introduced in the first quarter of  and increased threshold revenues worldwide 
drug discovery growth was driven primarily by the continued worldwide demand for our flipr as well as increased sales of ljl biosystems analyst ad and analyst ht 
in  gross margin decreased slightly to from in due to increased manufacturing costs 
research and development expenses for increased to million from million in  or an increase of 
the increased spending for the period is primarily the result of additional personnel over  as well as increased expenditures on development activities required to support both the introduction and ongoing development of new life sciences research and drug discovery products  including new reagent kits optimized for use on our detection systems 
we recorded a charge of million during the third quarter of related to the merger with ljl biosystems  including transition costs  investment banking  legal and other advisory services 
we recorded a charge of million during the second quarter of due to the write off of acquired in process research and development related to our acquisition of skatron 
the acquired in process research and development had no alternative future use at the date of acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in  or an increase of 
this increase was primarily the result of additional spending on marketing  sales and service related activities as we continued our efforts to expand worldwide market coverage and introduce new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were in and in the decrease from to reflected improved operating leverage as our revenue base grew 
other income net increased by in to million from million in due to an increased average cash balance primarily as a result of the capital raised through our secondary offering in may and the capital raised by ljl biosystems private placement 
we recorded income tax provisions of million in and million in these provisions reflected a effective tax rate in and an effective tax rate of in the effective tax rate for is calculated on profit before tax excluding the merger expenses related to the ljl biosystems merger in  which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
the lower rate in is primarily due to the realization of net operating loss carryforwards of ljl biosystems in that year 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  compared to million at december  in  operating activities provided million in cash 
however  due to million of merger costs in the third quarter of  million was used in operating activities during the year 
in  million was used in operating activities due to increases in accounts receivable  inventory and deferred tax assets 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  due to the net sales and maturities of million of short term investments  offset by million spent on acquisitions net of cash acquired and million of capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
in  investing activities cash use was primarily due to million of net short term investment purchases  million invested in other assets primarily a million investment in argonex  inc and a million strategic equity investment essen instruments  a privately held company and million of capital expenditures  primarily related to our facilities expansion in sunnyvale  california 
in  million of cash was used to purchase skatron instruments as 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  due to million spent to repurchase shares of our common stock  offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock for options exercised and employee stock purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in the proceeds were primarily generated by molecular devices public offering in the second quarter of  the ljl biosystems private placement in the first quarter of  as well as cash proceeds from stock option exercises during the year 
the proceeds relate primarily to the private placement by ljl biosystems in  as well as stock option exercises in that year 
in  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million  with nearly all of the repurchases occurring during the third quarter 
the repurchased shares represent and of the shares that were outstanding as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate our anticipated cash flow from operations is subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed under item i 
business business risks above  including in particular variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our products and collect accounts receivable and the timing of customer orders  competition  risks associated with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  supplier or manufacturing problems or delays and risks associated with past and potential future acquisitions 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of our research and development  the number and scope of our research programs  market acceptance and demand for our products  the costs that may be involved in enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities  manufacturing capacity requirements  and the costs of expanding our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities both in the united states and abroad 
we have generated sufficient cash flow to fund our capital requirements primarily through operating activities in  and financing activities in and however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional financing in the future to support our existing operations or potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities that may arise 
therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
our facilities are leased under noncancelable operating leases 
in addition  we have a contractual commitment for the purchase of certain resale products and manufacturing components with one vendor ending in as of december   the following is a summary of our contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases million million million million million unconditional purchase obligations million million total contractual cash obligations million million million million million our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
in connection with our acquisition of cytion sa in july  we are potentially obligated to pay as much as million to the selling stockholders of cytion sa in the event that certain milestones are met  at various times through june recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of fas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets on january  the adoption of fas and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position at transition 
we expect that the cessation of goodwill amortization net of related taxes will increase reported net income by approximately  or per share in we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of january  and will not record an impairment charge at transition 
we will continue to monitor the fair value of our goodwill through the annual impairment tests 

table of contents in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which supersedes both statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
fas retains the fundamental provisions in fas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with fas for example  fas provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
fas retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike fas  an impairment assessment under fas will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are required to adopt fas no later than its first fiscal year beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of fas for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on our financial statements because the impairment assessment under fas is largely unchanged from fas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and further disclosures relating to financial investments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest our excess cash primarily in demand deposits with united states banks and money market accounts and short term securities 
these securities  consisting of million of commercial paper and million of us government agency securities  are carried at market value  which approximate cost  typically mature or are redeemable within to days  and bear minimal risk 
we have not experienced any significant losses on the investments 
we are exposed to changes in exchange rates primarily in the united kingdom  japan  germany and canada  where we sell direct in local currencies 
all other foreign sales are denominated in us dollars and bear no exchange rate risk 
however  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in overseas markets 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions have historically been immaterial 
translation gains and losses related to our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom  japan  germany  switzerland and norway are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  but intend to do so in the future
