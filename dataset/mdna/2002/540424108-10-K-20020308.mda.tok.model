other competition cna competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance and reinsurance companies and other entities for both producers and customers and must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance and reinsurance products and services 
there are approximately  individual companies that sell property casualty insurance in the united states 
cna s consolidated property casualty subsidiaries ranked as the ninth largest property casualty insurance organization in the united states based upon statutory net written premiums 
cna re ranked as the th largest property casualty reinsurance organization in the united states  based upon statutory net written premiums  which are significantly higher than net written premiums in there are approximately  companies selling life insurance in the united states 
cna is ranked as the th largest life health insurance organization in the united states based on consolidated statutory premiums written 
dividends by insurance subsidiaries the payment of dividends to cna by its subsidiaries without prior approval of the affiliates domiciliary state insurance commissioners is limited by formula 
this formula varies by state 
the formula used by the majority of states provides that the greater of of prior year statutory surplus or prior year statutory net income  less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the months prior to the date of payment is available to be paid as a dividend to the parent company 
dividends from the ccc pool are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the state of illinois  the domiciliary state of ccc 
under these laws  ordinary dividends  or dividends that do not require prior approval of the illinois department of insurance the department may be paid only from earned surplus  which is calculated by removing unrealized gains which under statutory accounting includes cumulative earnings of ccc s subsidiaries from unassigned surplus 
as of december   ccc is in a negative earned surplus position 
in february of  the department approved an extraordinary dividend of million to be used to fund cna s debt service requirements 
until ccc is in a positive earned surplus position  all dividends require prior approval of the illinois insurance department 
in addition  by agreement with the new hampshire insurance department  as well as certain other state insurance departments  dividend payments for the continental insurance company pool are restricted to internal and external debt service requirements through september up to a maximum of million annually  without the prior approval of the new hampshire insurance department 
regulation the insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states 
each state has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents  approving policy forms  establishing reserve requirements  fixing minimum interest rates for accumulation of surrender values and maximum interest rates of policy loans  prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating solvency and the type and amount of investments permitted 
such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations  which require that rates not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
in addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries discussed above  intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by the state insurance regulator  depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance affiliates making the transfer or payments 
insurers are also required by the states to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers 
each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks 
cna s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state 
insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance related assessments 
guaranty fund and other insurance related assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent insurers 
reform of the us tort liability system is another issue facing the insurance industry 
over the last decade  many states have passed some type of reform  but more recently  a number of state courts have modified or overturned these reforms 
additionally  new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by legislatures 
continued unpredictability in the law means that insurance underwriting and rating is expected to be difficult in commercial lines  professional liability and some specialty coverages 
although the federal government and its regulatory agencies do not directly regulate the business of insurance  federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance business in a variety of ways 
these initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals  proposals to overhaul the superfund hazardous waste removal and liability statute  additional financial services modernization legislation  which could include provisions to have an alternate federal system of regulation for insurance companies  and various tax proposals affecting insurance companies 
cna s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements 
risk based capital is a method developed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the formula for determining the amount of risk based capital specifies various factors  weighted based on the perceived degree of risk  that are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity 
the adequacy of a company s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk based capital results  as determined by the formula 
companies below minimum risk based capital requirements are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specified corrective action 
as of december  and  all of cna s domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk based capital requirements 
cna re s principal united kingdom operations are contained in cna reinsurance company ltd 
the statutory surplus of cna reinsurance company ltd 
is below the required regulatory minimum surplus level at december  subsidiaries with insurance operations outside the united states are also subject to regulation in the countries in which they operate

the company s wholly owned subsidiary  lorillard  inc lorillard  is engaged  through its subsidiaries  in the production and sale of cigarettes 
the principal cigarette brand names of lorillard are newport  kent  true  maverick and old gold 
lorillard s largest selling brand is newport  which accounted for approximately of lorillard s sales in substantially all of lorillard s sales are in the united states 
lorillard s major trademarks outside of the united states were sold in lorillard accounted for  and of the company s consolidated total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for a number of years lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers have been faced with a number of factors which adversely affect lorillard s business  including lawsuits against tobacco manufacturers by private plaintiffs and governmental agencies  some of which have resulted in substantial jury verdicts  enacted and proposed legislation and regulation intended to discourage and restrict the marketing and smoking of cigarettes  and an overall decline in the social acceptability of smoking  coupled with increased pressure from anti tobacco groups 
see item of this report for information with respect to litigation against lorillard including litigation seeking substantial compensatory and punitive damages for adverse health effects claimed to have resulted from the use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco  and from exposure to tobacco smoke  and claims brought by cigarette wholesalers and others alleging violations of antitrust laws 
on november   lorillard  philip morris  rj reynolds  brown williamson and other manufacturers of tobacco products entered into a master settlement agreement the msa with states  the district of columbia  the commonwealth of puerto rico  guam  the us virgin islands  american samoa and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands collectively  the settling states to settle the asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and certain other claims of those states and territories 
lorillard and the other major us tobacco manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by florida  texas  minnesota and mississippi together with the msa  the state settlement agreements 
annual payments under the state settlement agreements are expected to be in excess of billion in future years 
the state settlement agreements and certain ancillary agreements are included as exhibits to this report exhibits through and are incorporated by reference thereto 
see also management s discussion and analysis results of operations  included in item in addition  pursuant to the terms of the msa  lorillard and other industry participants agreed to various restrictions and limitations regarding the advertising  promotion and marketing of tobacco products in the united states 
legislation and regulation federal legislation the federal comprehensive smoking education act  which became effective in  requires the use on cigarette packaging and advertising of one of the following four warning statements  on a rotating basis surgeon general s warning smoking causes lung cancer  heart disease  emphysema  and may complicate pregnancy 
surgeon general s warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health 
surgeon general s warning smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury  premature birth  and low birth weight 
surgeon general s warning cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide 
this law also requires that each person who manufactures  packages or imports cigarettes shall annually provide to the secretary of health and human services a list of the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes 
this list of ingredients may be submitted in a manner which does not identify the company which uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes which contain the ingredients 
prior to the effective date of the federal comprehensive smoking education act  federal law had  since  required that cigarette packaging bear a warning statement which from to was as follows warning the surgeon general has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health 
in addition  in lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers agreed  pursuant to consent orders entered into with the federal trade commission the ftc  to include this health warning statement in print advertising  on billboards and on certain categories of point of sale display materials relating to cigarettes 
furthermore  advertising of cigarettes has been prohibited on radio and television since from time to time  bills have been introduced in congress  among other things  to end or limit the price supports for leaf tobacco  to prohibit all tobacco advertising and promotion  to require new health warnings on cigarette packages and advertising  to authorize the establishment of various anti smoking education programs  to provide that current federal law should not be construed to relieve any person of liability under common or state law  to permit state and local governments to restrict the sale and distribution of cigarettes  concerning the placement of advertising of tobacco products  to provide that cigarette advertising not be deductible as a business expense  to prohibit the mailing of unsolicited samples of cigarettes and otherwise to restrict the sale or distribution of cigarettes  to impose an additional  or to increase existing  excise taxes on cigarettes  to require that cigarettes be manufactured in a manner that will cause them  under certain circumstances  to be self extinguishing  and to subject cigarettes to regulation in various ways by the us department of health and human services or other regulatory agencies  including regulation by the fda under the food  drug and cosmetics act 
in  congress passed legislation prohibiting the sale of cigarettes by vending machines on certain federal property  and the general services administration has published implementing regulations 
in january  the substance abuse and mental health services administration issued final regulations implementing a law section of the public health service act  which requires the states to enforce their tobacco sales minimum age laws as a condition of receiving federal substance abuse block grants 
food and drug administration regulation of tobacco products in  the fda published regulations the fda regulations which would have severely restricted cigarette advertising and promotion and limited the manner in which tobacco products could be sold 
in enacting the fda regulations  the fda determined that nicotine is a drug and that cigarettes are a nicotine delivery system and  accordingly  subject to fda regulatory authority as medical devices 
the fda premised its regulations on the need to reduce smoking by under age youth and young adults 
the fda regulations included the following i regulations regarding minimum sales age 
these regulations would have made unlawful the sale of cigarettes to anyone under age these regulations would have also required proof of age to be demanded from any person under age who attempts to purchase cigarettes 
ii regulations regarding advertising and billboards  vending machines  self service displays  sampling premiums  and package labels 
these regulations would have limited all cigarette advertising to black and white  text only format in most publications and outdoor advertising such as billboards 
the regulations also would have prohibited billboards advertising cigarettes within  feet of a school or playground  required that the established name for the product cigarettes and an intended use statement nicotine delivery device for persons or older be included on all cigarette packages and advertising  banned vending machine sales  product sampling  and the use of cigarette brand names  logos and trademarks on premium items  and prohibited the furnishing of any premium item in consideration for the purchase of cigarettes or the redemption of proofs of purchase coupons 
iii regulations which would have prohibited use of cigarette brand names to sponsor sporting and cultural events and required cigarette manufacturers to comply with certain stringent fda regulations known as good manufacturing practices governing the manufacture and distribution of medical devices 
lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers filed a lawsuit in the us district court in north carolina challenging the fda s assertion of jurisdiction over cigarettes 
lower court rulings in this litigation were appealed to the us supreme court which  on march   held that congress did not give the fda authority to regulate tobacco products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and  accordingly  the fda s assertion of jurisdiction over tobacco products was impermissible under that act 
since the supreme court decision  various proposals have been made for federal and state legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers 
in september of  former president clinton appointed a presidential commission to collect information and make recommendations regarding changes in the tobacco farming economy 
in may of  the commission issued a final report recommending  among other things  that congress authorize the fda to establish fair and equitable regulatory mechanisms over the manufacture  sale  marketing  distribution and labeling of tobacco products 
in addition  the final report recommended a increase in the federal excise tax on each pack of cigarettes sold in the united states to fund various of the report s recommendations 
lorillard cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the commission s recommendations 
congressional advocates of fda regulation have introduced legislation that would give the fda authority to regulate the manufacture  sale  distribution and labeling of tobacco products to protect public health for consideration by the th congress 
lorillard cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proposal 
in addition  in december of  the fda requested the institute of medicine  a private  non profit organization which advises the federal government on medical issues  to convene a committee of experts to formulate scientific methods and standards for the assessment of potential reduced exposure products preps  including conventional and alternative cigarettes 
on february   the committee issued a draft report recommending that congress enact legislation enabling a suitable agency to regulate tobacco related products that purport to reduce exposure to one or more tobacco toxicants or to reduce risk of disease  and to implement other policies designed to reduce the harm from tobacco use 
the report recommended regulation of all tobacco products  including preps 
lorillard cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the recommendations provided in the committee s report 
environmental tobacco smoke studies and reports with respect to the alleged health risk to nonsmokers of environmental tobacco smoke ets have received significant publicity 
in  the surgeon general of the united states and the national academy of sciences reported that ets exposes nonsmokers to an increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory illness 
in january of  the united states environmental protection agency released a report the epa risk assessment concluding that ets is a human lung carcinogen in adults  and causes respiratory effects in children  including increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections  increased prevalence of fluid in the middle ear and additional episodes and increased severity and frequency of asthma 
many scientific papers on ets have been published since the epa report  with variable conclusions 
in recent years  many federal  state  local and municipal governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit or restrict  or are intended to discourage  smoking  including legislation  regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in various places such as public buildings and facilities  stores and restaurants and on airline flights and in the workplace 
this trend has increased significantly since the release of the epa risk assessment 
additional laws  regulations and policies intended to prohibit  restrict or discourage smoking are being proposed or considered by various federal  state and local governments  agencies and private businesses with increasing frequency 
in july of  a federal judge struck down the lung cancer related portions of the epa s scientific risk assessment in an opinion which is currently on appeal 
in september of  the california environmental protection agency released a report the cal epa report  concluding that ets causes specified development  respiratory  carcinogenic  and cardiovascular effects including lung and nasal sinus cancer  heart disease  sudden infant death syndrome  respiratory infections and asthma induction and exacerbation in children 
the cal epa report was subsequently released as a monograph by the national cancer institute in november of in may of  the department of health and human service s national toxicology program listed ets as known to be a human carcinogen 
various public health organizations have also issued statements on environmental tobacco smoke and its health effects 
the california air resources board is in the early stages of the process of determining whether to identify ets as a toxic air contaminant  or tac  under the toxic air contaminant identification and control act  referred to as the tanner act 
the children s environmental health protection act amended the tanner act to require a review of tacs for the purpose of ensuring adequate protection of children s health  and to tighten existing controls as needed 
if california  on the basis of its assessments of risk and exposure  identifies ets as a tac  california could initiate the control phase of the tanner act  which involves adoption of measures to reduce or eliminate emissions 
these measures could include further restrictions regarding venues where smoking is permitted or controls on product emissions 
ingredient disclosure on august   the commonwealth of massachusetts enacted legislation requiring each manufacturer of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco sold in massachusetts to submit to the department of public health dph an annual report  beginning in  identifying for each brand sold certain added constituents  and providing nicotine yield ratings and other information for certain brands based on regulations promulgated by the dph 
the legislation provides for the public release of this information  which includes trade secret ingredients used in cigarettes 
in  several cigarette and smokeless tobacco manufacturers filed suit in federal district court in boston challenging the legislation 
on december   the court issued a preliminary injunction  enjoining the required submission of ingredient data to the dph 
the requirement to submit the nicotine yield ratings and other information was not enjoined  and the cigarette and smokeless tobacco manufacturers submitted their data to the dph on december  and again on each december since the district court ruled on september  that the massachusetts law and its implementing regulations were unconstitutional as to the required submission of ingredient data 
the commonwealth of massachusetts appealed to the us circuit court for the first circuit  and a three judge panel of the first circuit reversed the district court s ruling on october  the cigarette and smokeless tobacco manufacturers filed petitions for an en banc rehearing on october  and the first circuit subsequently granted the petitions 
oral argument on the rehearing occurred on january  the panel has not yet issued its decision 
any impact on lorillard from the legislation and its implementing regulations cannot now be predicted 
other similar laws and regulations have been enacted or considered by other state governments  and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of lorillard and the company if implemented without adequate provisions to protect the manufacturers trade secrets from being disclosed 
the state of texas has implemented legislation similar to the massachusetts measure described above 
however  the texas legislation does not allow for the public release of trade secret information 
fire safety standards in august of  new york state enacted legislation that requires the state s office of fire prevention and control to promulgate by january  fire safety standards for cigarettes sold in new york 
the legislation requires that cigarettes sold in new york meet ignition propensity performance standards established by the office of fire prevention and control 
all cigarettes sold in new york will be required to meet the established standards within days after the standards are promulgated 
lorillard cannot predict the impact of this law on its business until the standards are published 
similar legislation is being considered in other states and localities and at the federal level 
advertising and sales promotion lorillard advertises its products to adult smokers in magazines  newspapers  direct mail and point of sale display materials 
in addition  lorillard promotes its cigarette brands to adult smokers through distribution of store coupons  retail price promotions  and personal contact with distributors and retailers 
lorillard believes that it conducts these activities in accordance with the terms of the msa and other applicable restrictions 
as a general matter  lorillard allocates its marketing expenditures among brands on the basis of marketplace opportunity and profitable return 
in particular  lorillard focuses its marketing efforts on the premium segment of the us cigarette industry  with a specific focus on newport 
advertising of tobacco products through television and radio has been prohibited since in addition  advertising and promotion activities by lorillard and other major tobacco manufacturers have been severely restricted by the state settlement agreements and could be further restricted by proposed federal  state and local laws and regulations 
pursuant to the msa  lorillard and the other major tobacco product manufacturers have agreed to various restrictions and limitations regarding the advertising  promotion and marketing of tobacco products in the united states 
among other things  the msa prohibits the targeting of youth in the advertising  promotion or marketing of tobacco products  bans the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and promotion  limits each tobacco manufacturer to one event sponsorship during any twelve month period  which may not include major team sports or events in which the intended audience includes a significant percentage of youth  bans all outdoor advertising of tobacco products with the exception of small signs at retail establishments that sell tobacco products  bans tobacco manufacturers from offering or selling apparel and other merchandise that bears a tobacco brand name  subject to specified exceptions  prohibits the distribution of free samples of tobacco products except within adult only facilities  prohibits payments for tobacco product placement in various media  and bans gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient proof that the intended gift recipient is an adult 
many states  cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further restricting tobacco advertising 
there may be additional state and federal legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the advertising and sales promotion of cigarettes in the future 
lorillard cannot predict the impact of such initiatives on its marketing and sales efforts 
lorillard has funded and plans to continue to fund a youth smoking prevention program  which is designed to discourage youth from smoking 
the program addresses not only youth  but also parents and  through the we card program  retailers  to prevent purchase of cigarettes by underage purchasers 
in accordance with the msa  lorillard has determined not to advertise its cigarettes in magazines with large readership among people under the age of introduction of new brands  brand extensions and packings require the expenditures of substantial sums for advertising and sales promotion  with no assurance of consumer acceptance 
the advertising media presently used by lorillard includes magazines  newspapers  direct mail and point of sale display materials 
sales promotion activities are conducted by distribution of store coupons  point of sale display advertising  advertising of promotions in print media  and personal contact with distributors  retailers and consumers 
distribution methods lorillard sells its products primarily to distributors  who in turn service retail outlets  chain store organizations  and government agencies  including the us armed forces 
upon completion of the manufacturing process  lorillard ships cigarettes to public distributing warehouse facilities for rapid order fulfillment to wholesalers and other direct buying customers 
lorillard retains a portion of its manufactured cigarettes at its greensboro central distribution center and greensboro cold storage facility for future finished goods replenishment 
as of december   lorillard had approximately direct buying customers servicing more than  retail accounts 
lorillard does not sell cigarettes directly to consumers 
during  and  sales made by lorillard to mclane company  inc  a wholesale distributor wholly owned by wal mart stores  inc  comprised  and  respectively  of lorillard s revenues 
no other customer accounted for more than of  or sales 
lorillard does not have any backlog orders 
most of lorillard s customers buy cigarettes on a next day delivery basis 
approximately of lorillard s customers purchase cigarettes using electronic funds transfer  which provides immediate payment to lorillard 
lorillard s sales personnel monitor inventories  work with retailers on displays and signs  and enter into promotional arrangements with retailers from time to time 
raw materials and manufacturing in its production of cigarettes  lorillard uses domestic burley tobacco  flue cured leaf tobacco grown in the united states and abroad  and aromatic tobacco grown primarily in turkey and other near eastern countries 
a domestic supplier manufactures all of lorillard s reconstituted tobacco 
lorillard purchases more than of its domestic leaf tobacco from dimon international  inc lorillard directs dimon in the purchase of tobacco according to lorillard s specifications for quality  grade  yield  chemistry  particle size  moisture content and other characteristics 
dimon purchases and processes the whole leaf and then dries and bundles it for shipment to and storage at lorillard s danville facility 
dimon historically has procured most of lorillard s leaf tobacco requirements through commission buyers at tobacco auctions 
however  the tobacco industry is currently shifting to direct contract purchasing from tobacco farmers 
dimon has stated in its public filings that it believes it is well prepared to participate in direct contracting with tobacco farmers in the united states and that it does not expect any material economic effect from the progressive shift from the auction system to direct contract buying 
lorillard entered into a new contract with dimon to reflect the transition from auction to direct contract purchasing 
in the event that dimon becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to lorillard  lorillard believes that it can readily obtain high quality leaf tobacco from well established  alternative industry sources  including standard commercial corporation and universal corporation 
due to the varying size and quality of annual crops and other economic factors  including us tobacco production controls  tobacco prices have historically fluctuated 
the us price supports that accompany production controls have inflated the market price of tobacco 
in addition  the transition in tobacco purchasing from auction markets to direct farmer contracting may increase the market price of domestically grown tobacco 
however  lorillard does not believe that this increase  if any  will have a material effect on its business 
over the past five years  prices paid by lorillard for tobacco have risen less than the us rate of inflation  as measured by the us consumer price index 
lorillard stores its tobacco in storage warehouses on its acre danville facility 
to protect against loss  amounts of all types and grades of tobacco are stored in each warehouse 
because the process of aging tobacco normally requires approximately two years  lorillard maintains large quantities of leaf tobacco at all times 
lorillard believes its current tobacco supplies are adequately balanced for its present production requirements 
if necessary  lorillard can purchase aged tobacco in the open markets to supplement existing inventories 
lorillard produces cigarettes at its greensboro manufacturing plant  which has a production capacity of approximately million cigarettes per day and approximately billion cigarettes per year 
through various automated systems and sensors  lorillard actively monitors all phases of production to promote quality and compliance with applicable regulations 
prices lorillard believes that the volume of us cigarette sales is sensitive to price changes 
changes in pricing by lorillard or other cigarette manufacturers could have an adverse impact on lorillard s volume of units sold  which in turn could have an adverse impact on lorillard s profits and earnings 
lorillard makes independent pricing decisions based on a number of factors 
lorillard cannot predict the potential adverse impact of price changes on industry volume or lorillard volume  on the mix between premium and discount sales  on lorillard s market share or on lorillard s profits and earnings 
during  lorillard increased its net wholesale price of its cigarettes by an aggregate of per thousand cigarettes per pack of cigarettes 
taxes on january   the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased by per thousand cigarettes 
federal excise taxes included in the price of cigarettes are per thousand cigarettes per pack of cigarettes 
state excise taxes  which are levied upon and paid by the distributors  are also in effect in the fifty states  the district of columbia and many municipalities 
various states have proposed  and certain states have recently passed  increases in their state tobacco excise taxes 
the state taxes generally range from 
to per package of twenty cigarettes

lorillard believes that its properties and machinery are in generally good condition 
lorillard leases sales offices in major cities throughout the united states  a cold storage facility in greensboro and warehousing space in public distributing warehouses located throughout the united states 
competition lorillard sells its cigarette products in the united states  puerto rico and certain us territories 
though the domestic us market is highly competitive  lorillard believes its ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained by the philip morris retail leaders program 
competition is primarily based on a brand s price  positioning  consumer loyalty  retail display  promotion  quality and taste 
lorillard s principal competitors are the three other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris  rj reynolds and brown williamson 
lorillard s market share of the us cigarette industry was fourth highest overall 
philip morris  rj reynolds and brown williamson accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of wholesale shipments in among the four major manufacturers  lorillard ranked third behind philip morris and rj reynolds with an share of the premium segment in premium cigarette sales accounted for of lorillard s total units shipped in the following table sets forth cigarette sales data provided by the industry and by lorillard to management science associates 
for reporting purposes  unit sales by small manufacturers  selling super price discounted brands  many of whom are not currently affected to a significant degree by payment obligations under the state settlement agreements are estimated by management science associates 
the table below indicates the relative position of lorillard in the industry 
the years and have been restated to reflect management science associates estimates for the small manufacturers shipments 
industry lorillard lorillard calendar year to industry management science associates divides the cigarette market into two price segments  the premium price segment and the discount or reduced price segment 
according to management science associates  the discount segment share of market decreased from approximately in to in virtually all of lorillard s sales are in the full price segment where lorillard s share amounted to approximately in and in  as reported by management science associates

the hotels owned by loews hotels are subject to mortgage indebtedness aggregating approximately million at december  with interest rates ranging from to and maturing between and in addition  certain hotels are held under leases which are subject to formula derived rental increases  with rentals aggregating approximately million for the year ended december  competition from other hotels  motor hotels and inns  including facilities owned by local interests and by national and international chains  is vigorous in all areas in which loews hotels operates 
the demand for hotel rooms in many areas is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions 
loews hotels properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other than those in which its hotels are located 
competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on location and service 
competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price as well as location and service 
because of the competitive nature of the industry  hotels must continually make expenditures for updating  refurnishing and repairs and maintenance  in order to prevent competitive obsolescence

markets diamond offshore s principal markets for its offshore contract drilling services are the gulf of mexico  europe  including principally the uk sector of the north sea  south america  africa  and australia southeast asia 
diamond offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide 
diamond offshore contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions 
diamond offshore often obtains its contracts through competitive bidding  although it is not unusual for diamond offshore to be awarded drilling contracts without competitive bidding 
drilling contracts generally provide for a basic drilling rate on a fixed dayrate basis regardless of whether such drilling results in a productive well 
drilling contracts may also provide for lower rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns  adverse weather or water conditions or other conditions beyond the control of diamond offshore 
under dayrate contracts  diamond offshore generally pays the operating expenses of the rig  including wages and the cost of incidental supplies 
dayrate contracts have historically accounted for a substantial portion of diamond offshore s revenues 
in addition  diamond offshore has worked some of its rigs under dayrate contracts pursuant to which the customer also agrees to pay diamond offshore an incentive bonus based upon performance 
a dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well  a group of wells a well to well contract or a stated term a term contract and may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or  in some cases  due to other events beyond the control of either party 
in addition  certain of diamond offshore s contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice and in some circumstances may require the payment of an early termination fee by the customer 
the contract term in many instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells at fixed or mutually agreed terms  including dayrates 
the duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by market demand and the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractor and its customers 
in periods of rising demand for offshore rigs  contractors typically prefer well to well contracts that allow contractors to profit from increasing dayrates 
in contrast  during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level 
conversely  in periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs  contractors generally prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization  while customers prefer well to well contracts that allow them to obtain the benefit of lower dayrates 
in general  diamond offshore seeks to have a foundation of long term contracts with a reasonable balance of single well  well to well and short term contracts to minimize the downside impact of a decline in the market while still participating in the benefit of increasing dayrates in a rising market 
customers diamond offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government owned oil companies 
several customers have accounted for or more of diamond offshore s annual consolidated revenues  although the specific customers may vary from year to year 
during  diamond offshore performed services for different customers with bp and petrobraspetroleo brasileiro sa petrobras accounting for and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues  respectively 
during  diamond offshore performed services for approximately different customers with petrobras and bp accounting for and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues  respectively 
during  diamond offshore performed services for approximately different customers with petrobras and shell companies including domestic and foreign affiliates accounting for and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues  respectively 
during periods of low demand for offshore drilling rigs  the loss of a single significant customer could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore s results of operations 
competition the contract drilling industry is highly competitive 
customers often award contracts on a competitive bid basis  and although a customer selecting a rig may consider  among other things  a contractor s safety record  crew quality  rig location  and quality of service and equipment  the historical oversupply of rigs has created an intensely competitive market in which price is the primary factor in determining the selection of a drilling contractor 
in periods of increased drilling activity  rig availability has  in some cases  also become a consideration  particularly with respect to technologically advanced units 
diamond offshore believes that competition for drilling contracts will continue to be intense in the foreseeable future 
contractors are also able to adjust localized supply and demand imbalances by moving rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates 
such movements  reactivations or a decrease in drilling activity in any major market could depress dayrates and could adversely affect utilization of diamond offshore s rigs 
governmental regulation diamond offshore s operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations  including certain regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment  requiring removal and clean up under certain circumstances  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
for example  diamond offshore may be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills for which it is held responsible 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may in certain circumstances impose strict liability rendering a company liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such company 
liability under such laws and regulations may result from either governmental or citizen prosecution 
such laws and regulations may expose diamond offshore to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  or for acts of diamond offshore that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
the application of these requirements or the adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore 
the united states oil pollution act of opa  and similar legislation enacted in texas  louisiana and other coastal states addresses oil spill prevention and control and significantly expands liability exposure across all segments of the oil and gas industry 
opa  such similar legislation and related regulations impose a variety of obligations on diamond offshore related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills 
opa imposes strict and  with limited exceptions  joint and several liability upon each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
indemnification and insurance diamond offshore s operations are subject to hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and gas wells such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  cratering or fires  the occurrence of which could result in the suspension of drilling operations  injury to or death of rig and other personnel and damage to or destruction of diamond offshore s  diamond offshore s customers or a third party s property or equipment 
damage to the environment could also result from diamond offshore s operations  particularly through oil spillage or uncontrolled fires 
in addition  offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
diamond offshore has insurance coverage and contractual indemnification for certain risks  but there can be no assurance that such coverage or indemnification will adequately cover diamond offshore s loss or liability in many circumstances or that diamond offshore will continue to carry such insurance or receive such indemnification 
in september of  diamond offshore s hull and machinery insurance underwriters notified diamond offshore that war risk coverage would be canceled in its physical damage policies unless diamond offshore paid significant additional insurance premiums for such coverage 
in order to avoid incurring the additional costs  diamond offshore has permitted such coverage to terminate and expects to self insure against physical damage war risk to the extent it is required to do so in the future 
most of diamond offshore s drilling contracts did not require diamond offshore to carry physical damage war risk insurance 
four drilling contracts did contain a requirement for such coverage and have been amended to permit diamond offshore to self insure against such risks

overview loews corporation reported a loss for the year ended of million or per share  compared to net income of  million or per share in the net loss was primarily attributable to cna s second quarter reserve charge of billion and losses of million at cna related to the world trade center attack and related events  as well as the fourth quarter restructuring and other charges at cna  and a charge of million after taxes at lorillard in the second quarter related to the agreement with the engle class 
the net loss in includes net investment gains of million or per share compared to gains of million or per share in the prior year 
the net loss also includes a charge for an accounting change of million or 
per share  related to the adoption by cna of a new accounting standard for derivative instruments 
net operating income loss is calculated by deducting net investment gains or losses investment gains or losses after deduction of related income taxes and minority interests and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of tax and minority interest  from net income loss 
analysts following our stock have advised us that such information is meaningful in assisting them in measuring the performance of our insurance subsidiaries 
in addition  it is used in management s discussion of the results of operations for the insurance related segments due to the significance of the amount of net investment gains or losses 
net operating income loss is also a common measure throughout the insurance industry 
net realized investment gains are excluded from this operating measure because investment gains or losses related to cna s available for sale investment portfolio are largely discretionary  are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance  and are therefore not an indication of trends in operations 
net income for the quarter ended december  was million or 
per share  compared to million or per share in net investment gains amounted to million in the fourth quarter of  compared to gains of million in the fourth quarter of net operating loss  which excludes net investment gains and losses  for the fourth quarter was million or 
per share  compared to net operating income of million or per share in the lower results in the current quarter are primarily due to charges of  and million  after taxes and minority interest  at cna related to restructuring and other related charges  enron related losses  and reserve strengthening primarily for the current accident year  respectively 
revenues for the year ended were billion  compared to billion in revenues for the year ended declined due primarily to lower earned premiums for cna s property casualty business

results of operations by business segment cna insurance operations are conducted by subsidiaries of cna financial corporation cna 
cna is an owned subsidiary of the company 
cna underwent significant management changes  strategic realignment and restructuring in the second half of these management changes as well as the strategic realignment and restructuring have changed the way cna manages its operations and makes business decisions  and therefore  necessitated a change in cna s reportable segments 
the changes made to cna s reportable segments were as follows i commercial insurance and cna excess select formerly included in agency market operations and risk management operations  were combined into standard lines  ii cna pro  cna healthpro  cna guaranty and credit formerly included in specialty operations and global operations were combined into specialty lines  iii losses and expenses related to the centralized adjusting and settlement of environmental pollution and other mass tort and asbestos apmt claims previously included in commercial insurance  cna excess select  risk management and global operations are now included in the other insurance segment  and iv personal insurance  cna unisource  agriculture insurance  entertainment insurance and other financial lines were moved from the various property casualty segments to the other insurance segment 
cna re  group operations and life operations are unchanged from the prior segment presentation 
cna now conducts its operations through five operating groups standard lines  specialty lines and cna re these groups comprise the company s property casualty segment  group operations and life operations 
in addition to these five operating segments  certain other activities are reported in the other insurance segment 
these segments reflect the way cna manages its operations and makes business decisions 
segment disclosures of prior periods have been modified to conform with the current year presentation 
world trade center event during the third quarter of  cna experienced a severe catastrophe loss estimated at million pretax  net of reinsurance  related to the september  world trade center disaster and related events wtc event 
the loss estimate is based on a total industry loss of billion and includes all lines of insurance 
the current estimate takes into account cna s substantial reinsurance agreements  including its catastrophe reinsurance program and corporate reinsurance programs 
these loss estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty 
subsequent developments on claims arising out of the wtc event  as well as the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables  could result in an increase in the total estimated net loss  which could be material to cna s results of operations 
the following table provides management s estimate of losses related to the wtc event on a gross basis before reinsurance and a net basis after reinsurance on cna s operating segments net of tax pretax aggregate total and gross net reinsurance pretax minority year ended december  losses impact a benefit impact interest in millions standard lines specialty lines cna re total property and casualty  group operations life operations total  a pretax impact of the wtc event before the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties 
the net impact includes of reinstatement and additional premiums 
second quarter prior year reserve strengthening during the second quarter of  cna noted the continued emergence of adverse loss experience across several lines of business related to prior years that are discussed in further detail below 
cna completed a number of reserve studies during the second quarter of for many of its lines of business  including those in which these adverse trends were noted 
with respect to apmt reserves  cna reviewed internal claims data as well as studies generated by external parties  including a significant industry analysis of asbestos and environmental pollution exposures by an international rating agency 
as a result of these various reviews  management concluded that ultimate losses  including losses for apmt claims  would be higher in the range of possible outcomes than previously estimated 
cna recorded charges of billion billion after tax and minority interest  net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty benefit  to strengthen reserves associated with a change in estimate of prior year net loss reserves  including billion pretax 
billion after tax and minority interest related to apmt 
the second quarter reserve strengthening and related items comprising the amounts noted above are detailed by segment in the following table standard specialty other year ended december  lines lines cna re insurance total in millions net reserve strengthening excluding the impact of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty apmt   non apmt  total   pretax benefit from corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty on accident year accrual for insurance related assessments net reserve strengthening and related accruals   change in estimate of premium accruals reduction of related commission accruals net premium and related accrual reductions total pretax second quarter reserve strengthening and other related accruals   total after tax and minority interest second quarter reserve strengthening and other related accruals  of ceded losses reduced by of ceded premiums and of interest charges 
the non apmt adverse loss development was the result of recent analyses of several lines of business 
this development related principally to commercial insurance coverages including automobile liability and multiple peril  as well as assumed reinsurance and health care related coverages 
a brief summary of these lines of business and the associated reserve development is discussed below and in more detail in the discussion of cna s segments 
approximately million of the adverse loss development  excluding the impact of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty  is a result of analyses of several coverages provided to commercial entities written by various segments of cna 
these analyses showed unexpected increases in the size of claims for several lines  including commercial automobile liability  general liability and the liability portion of commercial multiple peril 
in addition  the number of commercial automobile liability claims was higher than expected 
finally  several state specific factors resulted in higher than anticipated losses  including developments associated with commercial automobile liability coverage in ohio and general liability coverage provided to contractors in new york 
an analysis of cna re s assumed reinsurance business showed that the paid and reported losses for recent accident years were higher than expectations and resulted in an increase of net reserves of approximately million  excluding the impact of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty 
the estimated ultimate loss ratios for these recent accident years have been revised to reflect the paid and reported losses 
approximately million of adverse loss development  excluding the impact of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty  occurred in specialty lines and was caused by coverages provided to health care related entities 
the level of paid and reported losses associated with coverages provided to national long term care facilities was higher than expected 
in addition  the average size of claims resulting from coverages provided to physicians and institutions providing health care related services increased more than expected 
concurrent with cna s review of loss reserves  cna completed comprehensive studies of estimated premium receivable accruals on retrospectively rated insurance policies and involuntary market facilities 
as a result  cna recorded a 
billion pretax 
billion after tax and minority interest charge related to retrospective premium and other premium accruals premium accruals 
the studies included the review of all such retrospectively rated insurance policies and the current estimate of ultimate losses 
as a result of this review and changes in premiums associated with the change in estimates for loss reserves  cna recorded a pretax reduction in premium accruals of million 
the effect on net earned premiums was million offset by a reduction of accrued commissions of million 
approximately million of this amount resulted from a change in estimate in premiums related to involuntary market facilities  which had an offsetting impact on net losses and therefore had no impact on the net operating results for the year 
accruals for ceded premiums related to other reinsurance treaties increased million due to the reserve strengthening 
the remainder of the decrease in premium accruals relates to the change in estimate of the amount of retrospective premium receivables as discussed above 
aggregate reinsurance treaties in  cna entered into an aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the through accident years covering substantially all of cna s property casualty lines of business the aggregate cover 
cna has two sections of coverage under the terms of the aggregate cover 
these coverages attach at defined loss and allocated loss adjustment expense collectively  losses ratios for each accident year 
coverage under the first section of the aggregate cover  which is available for all accident years covered by the contract  has annual limits of million of ceded losses with an aggregate limit of billion of ceded losses for the three year period 
the ceded premiums are a percentage of ceded losses and for each million of limit the premium is million 
the second section of the aggregate cover  which is only available for accident year  provides additional coverage of up to million of ceded losses for a maximum ceded premium of million 
under the aggregate cover  interest charges on the funds withheld accrue at per annum 
if the aggregate loss ratio for the three year period exceeds certain thresholds  additional premiums may be payable and the rate at which interest charges are accrued would increase to per annum 
the coverage under the second section of the aggregate cover was triggered for the accident year 
as a result of losses related to the wtc event  the limit under this section was exhausted 
additionally  as a result of the significant reserve additions recorded during  the million limit on the accident year under the first section was also fully utilized 
no losses have been ceded to the remaining million of limit on accident years and under the first section 
in  cna entered into a one year aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the accident year covering substantially all property casualty lines of business in the continental casualty company pool the ccc cover 
the loss protection provided by the ccc cover has an aggregate limit of approximately million of ceded losses 
the ccc cover provides continuous coverage in excess of the second section of the aggregate cover discussed above 
under the ccc cover  interest charges on the funds withheld generally accrue at per annum 
the interest rate increases to per annum if the aggregate loss ratio exceeds certain thresholds 
the impact of the aggregate and ccc cover on pretax operating results for the year ended december   was as follows aggregate ccc cover cover total in millions ceded earned premiums ceded losses   interest charges pretax benefit on operating results the pretax benefit from the aggregate cover and ccc cover by operating segment on estimated losses related to the second quarter reserve strengthening  the wtc event and core operations for the year ended december   was as follows second quarter reserve wtc core strengthening event operations total amounts in millions standard lines specialty lines cna re pretax benefit on operating results restructuring in  cna finalized and approved two separate restructuring plans 
the first plan  which related to cna s information technology operations the it plan  was approved in june of the second plan  which principally relates to restructuring the property casualty segments and life operations  discontinuation of variable life and annuity business and consolidation of real estate locations the plan  was approved in december of it plan the overall goal of the it plan was to improve technology for the underwriting function throughout cna and to eliminate inefficiencies in the deployment of it resources 
the changes facilitate a strong focus on enterprise wide system initiatives 
the it plan had two main components  which include the reorganization of it resources into the technology and operations group with a structure based on centralized  functional roles and the implementation of an integrated technology roadmap that includes common architecture and platform standards that directly support cna s strategies 
as summarized in the following table  cna incurred million  pretax  of restructuring and other related charges in for the it plan 
cna does not expect to incur significant amounts of additional charges with respect to the it plan in any future period and  as a result  does not intend to separately classify such expenses as restructuring and other related charges when they occur 
it plan charges by segment for the year ended december   are as follows employee termination impaired and related asset other benefit costs charges costs total in millions standard lines specialty lines total property casualty life operations other insurance total in connection with the it plan after the write off of impaired assets  cna accrued million of restructuring and other related charges in the it plan initial accrual 
these charges primarily related to million of workforce reductions of approximately positions gross and positions net and million of other costs 
the following table summarizes the it plan initial accrual and the activity in that accrual during approximately million of the remaining accrual is expected to be paid out during employee termination impaired and related asset other benefit costs charges costs total in millions initial accrual cost that did not require cash payments charged against liability accrued costs through december   approximately employees were released due to the it plan  nearly all of whom were technology support staff 
the it plan is not expected to result in decreased operating expense in the foreseeable future 
this is because savings from the workforce reduction will be offset by new technology related initiatives 
plan the overall goal of the plan is to create a simplified and leaner organization for customers and business partners 
the major components of the plan include a reduction in the number of strategic business units sbus in the property casualty operations  changes in the strategic focus of the life operations and consolidation of real estate locations 
the reduction in the number of property casualty sbus resulted in consolidation of sbu functions  including underwriting  claims  marketing and finance 
the strategic changes in life operations include a decision to discontinue the variable life and annuity business 
as summarized in the following table  cna incurred million  pretax  of restructuring and other related charges for the plan 
cna does not expect to incur significant amounts of additional charges with respect to the plan in any future period and  as a result  does not intend to separately classify such expenses as restructuring and other related charges when they occur

all other charges were recorded in the segment benefiting from the services or existence of the employee or asset 
the plan charges incurred by standard lines were million  related entirely to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in the workforce of  positions  gross and net  of which million related to severance and outplacement costs and million related to other salary costs

management anticipates that the restructuring activities in will result in cost savings of approximately million in additionally  at december   an accrual of million for lease termination costs remained related to the august restructuring plan 
approximately million of these costs were paid in  resulting in a remaining accrual of million at december  no restructuring and other related charges related to the plan were incurred during or restructuring and other related charges for the plan amounted to million in terrorism exposure cna and the insurance industry incurred substantial losses related to the tragic events of september  for the most part  cna believes the industry was able to absorb the loss of capital from these losses  but the capacity to withstand the effect of any additional terrorism events was significantly diminished 
the public debate following september centered on the role  if any  the us federal government should play in providing a terrorism backstop for the industry 
several legislative proposals were introduced  but as yet  congress has not enacted any of the proposed solutions 
without any federal backstop in place  cna s businesses are exposed to losses arising from terrorism events 
cna is attempting to mitigate this exposure through its underwriting practices  policy terms and conditions  and use of reinsurance 
while the unexpired portion of cna s current reinsurance program generally provides coverage for terrorism events  cna expects that future property casualty and certain group life and accident reinsurance renewals will either exclude coverage or be significantly limited with respect to terrorism events 
cna does not expect any terrorism exclusion to be included in future individual life reinsurance renewals 
cna is generally including a terrorism exclusion or sub limit in its primary and reinsurance assumed policy forms and contracts for large property risks in selected geographic areas 
general liability and commercial auto policies for large commercial customers also generally exclude terrorism where permissible by law 
the primary property and casualty policy forms applicable to new and renewal policies for small and middle market commercial customers will generally include a terrorism exclusion  however  these policy forms have not yet been approved in all states 
cna is generally prohibited  from excluding terrorism exposure from its primary workers compensation  individual life and group life and health policies 
reinsurance considerations in addition to the terrorism coverage issues discussed  cna expects other significant changes related to the reinsurance environment in due to the significant increase in reinsurance costs for several lines of insurance  cna expects to purchase less reinsurance protection in than in the amount of reinsurance purchased has a direct impact on the level of gross and net exposure that cna is willing to underwrite in certain lines 
for example  the net retention on a substantial portion of standard lines workers compensation exposure will generally increase from  per each loss occurrence in to million per each loss occurrence in cna expects to retain approximately million more premium in as a result of this increase in retention in workers compensation exposure 
other property casualty exposures expected to be significantly impacted by changes in the level  cost and availability of reinsurance purchased in include  but are not limited to  surety  workers compensation  catastrophe and professional liability 
cna has purchased less finite reinsurance in than in prior years 
the reduced level of reinsurance purchased in will likely increase the volatility of reported losses  however  cna will also retain more premium than in prior years 
cna is currently finalizing its aggregate reinsurance protection for for a substantial portion of its property casualty business 
the reinsurance protection will be handled on a funds withheld basis 
property casualty cna conducts its property casualty operations through the following operating segments standard lines  specialty lines  and cna re 
the following table summarizes key components of the property casualty segment operating results for the years ended december   and year ended december in millions net earned premiums    underwriting loss   net operating loss income  ratios loss and loss adjustment expense ratio expense ratio dividend ratio 
combined ratio adjusted ratios loss and loss adjustment expense ratio expense ratio dividend ratio combined ratio adjusted underwriting loss the adjusted results exclude the impact of the second quarter reserve strengthening  the wtc event  corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties and restructuring and other related charges 
compared with the net operating loss for the property casualty segment was  million in as compared with net operating income of million in the decline in net operating results was principally due to prior year reserve strengthening of  million recorded in the second quarter of related to a change in estimate of prior year net loss reserves and retrospective premium accruals  net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty benefit  estimated losses related to the wtc event of million  net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty benefit  and restructuring and other related charges of million recorded in in addition  net operating results for decreased million due to a decline in investment income from limited partnerships and million for reserve strengthening primarily for the current accident year  in the london based primary commercial and marine operations 
net operating income also decreased million related to the recent bankruptcy filing by certain enron entities recorded in the fourth quarter of these declines were partially offset by lower prior year adverse loss reserve development excluding the second quarter reserve development and a million benefit related to corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties for core operations 
net operating results in benefited from a change in estimate for certain insurance related assessments of million in net operating results also decreased due to a million after tax charge to strengthen prior underwriting year loss reserves for cna reinsurance company limited cna re uk 
there was no tax benefit related to this charge due to the inability to recover further tax benefits related to the underwriting losses of cna re uk during the fourth quarter  cna updated its impairment analysis of subsidiaries held for sale  including the united kingdom subsidiaries of cna re 
the updated impairment analysis indicated that the million after tax and minority interest realized loss recorded in the second quarter of should be reduced by million  primarily because the net assets of cna re uk had been significantly diminished by its operating losses in the second half of in addition  cna updated its estimate of disposal costs  including anticipated capital contributions  to reflect changes in the planned structure of the anticipated sale 
the sale of the united kingdom insurance subsidiaries will be subject to regulatory approval and all sales are expected to be completed in based upon the significance of the charges related to the second quarter reserve strengthening  wtc event  corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties  and restructuring and other related charges  these items are discussed in the aggregate in the preceding sections 
the following discussion compares underwriting results and ratios excluding the effect of these items 
the adjusted combined ratio increased points in as compared with and the adjusted underwriting results for the property casualty segment declined million 
the adjusted loss ratio increased points as a result of the reduced net earned premiums base  losses related to enron  favorable loss development recorded in for the architects and engineers business not present in  declined underwriting results in global and marine lines related to current accident year reserve strengthening as discussed above  and the prior underwriting year reserve strengthening of cna re uk these declines were partially offset by improved underwriting results across most standard lines  particularly the automobile and packages lines  due to earned rate achievement and re underwriting efforts undertaken last year  and lower prior year adverse loss development excluding the second quarter reserve strengthening 
the increase in the adjusted expense ratio of points was primarily attributable to the decrease in the net earned premium base  the write off of unrecoverable deferred acquisition costs in the vehicle warranty line of business  an increase in the accrual for guaranty fund assessments related to the reliance insolvency  and the decreased impact of the change in estimate for certain insurance related assessments 
the adjusted dividend ratio increased points primarily due to adverse development in dividend reserves in standard lines in compared with favorable development taken in net earned premiums for the property casualty segment decreased  million for compared with this decline was comprised of decreases in standard lines of  million and cna re of million  partially offset by increased net earned premiums for specialty lines of million 
net earned premiums for standard lines decreased primarily as a result of million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties  additional ceded premiums other than the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties  increased adverse premium development excluding the second quarter reserve strengthening  a change in estimate for involuntary market premium accruals and additional adverse experience in retrospective premium accruals 
the change in estimate related to retrospective premium receivables was based upon cna s completion of comprehensive studies related to estimated premium receivable accruals on retrospectively rated insurance policies and involuntary market facilities 
the studies included the review of all such retrospectively rated insurance policies and the current estimate of ultimate losses 
net earned premiums for cna re decreased as a result of million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties 
in addition  premiums decreased as a result of the announced intention to sell the united kingdom insurance subsidiaries 
these declines were partially offset by reinstatement and additional premiums of million related to the wtc event 
net earned premiums for specialty lines increased due to increases in the law firms  the long term care and architects and engineers products as well as increased rate achievement in europe  primarily in property lines  the reserve for retrospective premium increase recorded in and decreased ceded premiums related to reinsurance for the medical professional liability line of business 
partially offsetting these improvements was million in additional ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties  declines in the warranty line of business and adverse experience in retrospective premium accruals recorded in the second quarter of reserve strengthening 
compared with net operating income improved million for as compared with the net operating income improvements were primarily driven by improved underwriting results partially offset by decreased investment income 
in addition  net operating income in both and benefited from a change in estimate for certain insurance related assessments resulting from regulatory changes in the basis on which certain of these assessments are calculated 
the after tax impact of this change was million in and million in underwriting results improved million for as compared with the combined ratio decreased points for the property casualty segment for as compared with this decrease reflects an improvement in the loss ratio of points which is primarily attributable to significant rate increases across the entire book of business  favorable catastrophe experience  reduced prior year reserve strengthening and the increased use of reinsurance 
catastrophe losses for improved by million for the property casualty segment 
in addition to the decrease in the loss ratio  there was a decrease of points in the expense ratio to due principally to the absence of restructuring related charges that occurred in but did not recur in the dividend ratio increased points relating to reduced favorable development in dividend reserves for standard lines in as compared to net earned premiums for the property casualty segment decreased million in as compared with this decline in net earned premiums was comprised of decreases in standard lines of million  specialty lines of million and cna re of million 
the decrease in net earned premiums in standard lines was primarily attributable to continued efforts to re underwrite business and obtain adequate rates for exposure underwritten and increased use of reinsurance 
the net earned premiums decline for specialty lines was related principally to i active decisions to renew only those accounts which meet current underwriting guidelines supporting the ongoing commitment to underwriting discipline  ii an increase in the retrospective return premium relating to favorable loss experience in the retrospectively rated architects and engineers business  and iii a million decline due to the increased use of reinsurance for the medical professional liability lines of cna healthpro 
these declines were partially offset by growth in the commercial casualty and property lines in the european operations  as well as growth in the commercial warranty and surety lines 
cna re experienced a decrease in net earned premiums that reflects decisions not to renew contracts that management believed did not meet profitability targets  partially offset by modest rate increases 
group group operations provides group life and health insurance products and services to employers  affinity groups and other entities that purchase insurance as a group 
group operations also provides health insurance to federal employees  as well as life and health reinsurance 
compared with net operating income decreased by million in as compared with this decrease is related primarily to estimated losses of million after tax and minority interest as a result of the wtc event 
net operating income also declined million as a result of the sale of life reinsurance and million due to a decline in limited partnership income 
life reinsurance contributed net operating income of million in partially offsetting these declines were improvements as a result of exiting unprofitable lines of approximately million  and increased income in other product lines  primarily the disability and group long term care lines of million 
net earned premiums for group operations decreased million in as compared with net earned premiums declined million as a result of the sale of life reinsurance and million in group reinsurance primarily as a result of terminating unprofitable contracts with independent underwriting agencies in these declines were partially offset by increases in federal markets of million due to increased medical cost trends and growth in group benefits of million  particularly in the disability and group long term care lines of business 
group operations achieved rate increases in that averaged approximately for the disability line of business 
premium persistency rates were in the mid percent range 
for the group life line of business  rate increases averaged to 
premium persistency rates were in the lower range 
compared with net operating income increased million in as compared with this increase relates to a million improvement in federal markets due to the exit of unprofitable medical lines  a million improvement in group reinsurance  a million improvement in life reinsurance and a million increase in limited partnership income 
these improvements were partially offset by a million decline in group benefits due to favorable loss experience in the group life line of business 
the improvement associated with group reinsurance relates to adverse experience and loss development for the personal accident business recorded in  which exceeded million of exit costs incurred from the management services organization mso business and million of adverse development on the medical stop loss business in the decision to shut down the mso business was based on lack of demand as providers were backing away from risk contracting 
net earned premiums for group operations in increased million as compared with this increase was principally a result of a million increase in group benefits  primarily related to the group life line of business  a million increase in life reinsurance  an million increase in group reinsurance  and a million increase in federal markets 
the increases in group benefits and life reinsurance relate to new business production

sales volume for life operations decreased by million in as compared with this decline was driven primarily by declines in the sales of variable annuities and as a result of the decision to cease purchasing new viatical policies 
these declines were partially offset by increased renewals and increased new sales in long term care products 
net earned premiums increased million in as compared with this improvement is attributable primarily to improved sales of structured settlements because of favorable pricing conditions and long term care products  partially offset by a decrease in new individual life business

additionally  operating revenues declined as a result of decreased net investment income 
environmental pollution and other mass tort and asbestos reserves cna s property casualty insurance subsidiaries have potential exposures related to apmt claims 
environmental pollution cleanup is the subject of both federal and state regulation 
by some estimates  there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to cleanup 
the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues 
judicial interpretations in many cases have expanded the scope of coverage and liability beyond the original intent of the policies 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund and comparable state statutes mini superfunds govern the cleanup and restoration of toxic waste sites and formalize the concept of legal liability for cleanup and restoration by potentially responsible parties prps 
superfund and the mini superfunds establish mechanisms to pay for cleanup of waste sites if prps fail to do so  and to assign liability to prps 
the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent upon a variety of factors 
further  the number of waste sites subject to cleanup is unknown 
to date  approximately  cleanup sites have been identified by the environmental protection agency epa and included on its national priorities list npl 
state authorities have designated many cleanup sites as well 
many policyholders have made claims against various cna insurance subsidiaries for defense costs and indemnification in connection with environmental pollution matters 
these claims relate to accident years and prior  which coincides with cna s adoption of the simplified commercial general liability coverage form  which includes what is referred to in the industry as an absolute pollution exclusion 
cna and the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims 
key coverage issues include whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies  trigger of coverage  allocation of liability among triggered policies  applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions  the potential for joint and several liability and the definition of an occurrence 
to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues 
a number of proposals to reform superfund have been made by various parties 
however  no reforms were enacted by congress during  and it is unclear what positions congress or the administration will take and what legislation  if any  will result in the future 
if there is legislation  and in some circumstances even if there is no legislation  the federal role in environmental cleanup may be significantly reduced in favor of state action 
substantial changes in the federal statute or the activity of the epa may cause states to reconsider their environmental cleanup statutes and regulations 
there can be no meaningful prediction of the pattern of regulation that would result or the effect upon cna s results of operations and or financial position 
due to the inherent uncertainties described above  including the inconsistency of court decisions  the number of waste sites subject to cleanup  and the standards for cleanup and liability  the ultimate liability of cna for environmental pollution claims may vary substantially from the amount currently recorded 
as of december  and  cna carried approximately and million of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  for reported and unreported environmental pollution and other mass tort claims 
unfavorable environmental pollution and other mass tort net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the year ended december  and amounted to and million 
favorable environmental pollution and other mass tort net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the year ended december  amounted to million 
the company made environmental pollution related claim payments and other mass tort related claim payments  net of reinsurance recoveries  of  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reserve development during for environmental pollution and other mass tort reserves was due to reviews completed during the year  which indicated that paid and reported losses were higher than expectations based on prior reviews 
factors that have led to this development include a number of declaratory judgments filed this year due to an increasingly favorable legal environment for policyholders in certain courts and other unfavorable decisions regarding cleanup issues 
cna s property casualty insurance subsidiaries also have exposure to asbestos related claims 
estimation of asbestos related claim and claim adjustment expense reserves involves many of the same limitations discussed above for environmental pollution claims  such as inconsistency of court decisions  specific policy provisions  allocation of liability among insurers and insureds  and additional factors such as missing policies and proof of coverage 
furthermore  estimation of asbestos related claims is difficult due to  among other reasons  the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties  the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants  the uncertainty as to which other insureds may be targeted in the future and the uncertainties inherent in predicting the number of future claims 
as of december  and  cna carried approximately  and million of net claim and claim adjustment expense reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  for reported and unreported asbestos related claims 
unfavorable asbestos related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the years ended december   and amounted to  and million  respectively 
cna made asbestos related claim payments  net of reinsurance  of  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  excluding payments made in connection with the settlement of litigation related to fibreboard corporation 
cna has attempted to manage its asbestos related exposures by aggressively resolving old accounts 
the reserve development during for asbestos related claims was based on a management review of developments with respect to these exposures conducted during the year 
this analysis indicated a significant increase in claim counts for asbestos related claims 
the factors that have led to the deterioration in claim counts include  among other things  intensive advertising campaigns by lawyers for asbestos claimants and the addition of new defendants such as the distributors and installers of products containing asbestos 
new claim filings increased significantly in over and that trend continued during the volume of new claims has caused the bankruptcies of numerous asbestos defendants 
those bankruptcies also may result in increased liability for remaining defendants under principles of joint and several liability 
in addition  some asbestos related defendants have asserted that their claims for insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage 
cna currently has such claims from a number of insureds 
some of these claims involve insureds facing exhaustion of products liability aggregate limits in their policies  who have asserted that their asbestos related claims fall within so called non products liability coverage contained within their policies rather than products liability coverage  and that the claimed non products coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate size of any of the claims for coverage not subject to aggregate limits or predict to what extent  if any  the attempts to assert non products claims outside the products liability aggregate will succeed 
due to the uncertainties created by volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands  the effect of bankruptcies  the extent to which non impaired claimants can be precluded from making claims and the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage not subject to aggregate limits  the ultimate liability of cna for asbestos related claims may vary substantially from the amount currently recorded 
other variables that will influence cna s ultimate exposure to asbestos related claims include medical inflation trends  jury attitudes  the strategies of plaintiff attorneys to broaden the scope of defendants  the mix of asbestos related diseases presented and the possibility of legislative reform 
adverse developments with respect to such matters discussed herein could have a material adverse effect on cna s results of operations and or financial condition 
the results of operations and financial condition of cna in future years may continue to be adversely affected by environmental pollution and other mass tort and asbestos claim and claim adjustment expenses 
management will continue to review and monitor these liabilities and make further adjustments  including further reserve strengthening as warranted

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the state settlement agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on lorillard and the other major us cigarette manufacturers and the master settlement agreement places significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes 
the company believes that the implementation of the state settlement agreements will materially adversely affect its consolidated results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
the degree of the adverse impact will depend  among other things  on the rates of decline in us cigarette sales in the premium and discount segments  lorillard s share of the domestic premium and discount segments  and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the state settlement agreements 
net income declined for the year ended december   due to a charge of million net of taxes to record the effect of the engle agreement discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
excluding this charge  net income would have increased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to this increase in net income was primarily due to the impact of wholesale price increases  partially offset by lower unit sales volume and increased sales promotional expenses  mostly in the form of coupons and other discounts provided to retailers and passed through to the consumer 
in accordance with industry practice  promotional support in the form of coupons and other discounts is recorded as an expense under other operating expenses rather than reducing net sales 
in the first quarter of  lorillard will be required to adopt the provisions of the fasb s emerging issues task force issues no

excluding this gain  revenues and income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles increased by and million  respectively 
revenues and income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles increased due primarily to increased overall average room rates and the addition of two luxury properties to the loews hotels portfolio  offsetting the sale of the two franchised properties 
overall occupancy rates remained at approximately  essentially unchanged from income also benefited from improved operating results of an unconsolidated joint venture whose operations commenced in diamond offshore diamond offshore drilling  inc and subsidiaries diamond offshore

operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates  nor are they significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  diamond offshore realizes few decreases in operating expenses since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  diamond offshore is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically charged to the operator under drilling contracts 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  diamond offshore may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income

cna is closely managing the cash flows related to claims and reinsurance recoverables from the wtc event 
it is anticipated that significant claim payments will be made prior to receipt of the corresponding reinsurance recoverables 
cna does not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from these payments 
as of march   cna has paid million in claims and recovered million from reinsurers 
cna s estimated gross pretax losses for the wtc event were  million  million after tax and minority interest 
net pretax losses before the effect of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties were million 
approximately  and of the reinsurance recoverables on the estimated losses related to the wtc event are from companies with s p ratings of aaa  aa or a  respectively 
effective january   cna sold the maiden lane  new york  facility 
the sale of this property provided additional liquidity to cna with net sale proceeds of million 
during  cna discontinued its commercial paper program and repaid all loans outstanding under the program 
the funds used to retire the outstanding commercial paper debt were obtained through the draw down of the full amount available under cna s million revolving credit facility 
the facility is composed of two parts a million component with a day expiration date with an option to convert into a one year term loan and a million component with a three year expiration date 
cna pays a facility fee to the lenders for having funds available for loans under both components of the facility  the fee varies based on the long term debt ratings of cna 
at december  the facility fee on the day component was basis points and the facility fee on the three year component was basis points 
in addition to the facility fees  cna pays interest on outstanding debt borrowings under the facility based on a rate determined using the long term debt ratings of cna 
the current interest rate is equal to the london interbank offering rate libor plus basis points for the day component and libor plus basis points for the three year component 
further  if cna has outstanding loans greater than of the amounts available under the facility  cna also pays a utilization fee of basis points on such loans 
a moody s downgrade of the cna senior debt rating from baa to baa would increase the facility fee on the day component of the facility from basis points to basis points  and the facility fee on the three year component would increase from basis points to basis points 
the applicable interest rate on the day component would increase from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points and the applicable interest rate on the three year component would increase from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points 
the utilization fee would remain unchanged on both components at basis points 
the million revolving credit facility replaced cna s million revolving credit facility the prior facility  which was scheduled to expire on may  no loans were outstanding under the prior facility anytime during to offset the variable rate characteristics of the prior facility and the interest rate risk associated with periodically reissuing commercial paper  in and cna entered into interest rate swap agreements with several banks 
these agreements required cna to pay interest at a fixed rate in exchange for the receipt of the three month libor 
the effect of the interest rate swap agreements was to decrease interest expense by approximately million for the year ended december  and increase interest expense by million for the year ended december  the terms of cna s credit facility requires cna to maintain certain financial ratios and combined property casualty company statutory surplus levels 
at december  and  cna was in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants 
following the announcement of second quarter earnings  cna s commercial paper rating was placed under review by s p 
during the review period  cna  through an affiliated company held varying amounts of its commercial paper with the intent to put it back into the market after the review was completed 
on october   s p lowered cna s commercial paper rating from a to a  and maintained the creditwatch negative status 
on december   moody s lowered the long term debt rating from baa to baa and affirmed the p short term debt rating 
the commercial paper rating downgrade  the impacts of the wtc event and an overall decline in the market made it difficult to maintain a commercial paper program 
following consultation with cna s commercial and investment bankers  management determined that the most economical way to replace the commercial paper was to draw on the revolving bank credit facility 
in the normal course of business  cna has obtained letters of credit in favor of various unaffiliated insurance companies  regulatory authorities and other entities 
at december  there were approximately million of outstanding letters of credit  of which approximately million are collateralized with cash and securities 
cna has committed approximately million to future capital calls from various third party limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships 
cna has a commitment to purchase a million floating rate note issued by the californian earthquake authority in the event california earthquake related insurance losses exceed billion prior to december  cna has entered into a limited number of guaranteed payment contracts 
these relate primarily to telecom service contracts and amount to payments of approximately million guaranteed for through additionally  cna is obligated to future payments totaling million for non cancelable operating leases expiring from through primarily for office space  data processing  office and transportation equipment 
ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
cna s insurance company subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies  and these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of the insurance company s financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders 
agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any security  and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization 
each agency s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency s rating 
the table below reflects ratings issued by am best  s p  moody s and fitch as of february  for the continental casualty company ccc pool  the continental insurance company cic pool and the continental assurance company cac pool

on february   fitch removed the rating watch negative status and affirmed the insurance financial strength rating of ccc and the senior debt rating of cna 
on september   following the wtc event  fitch affirmed the ratings of cac and placed ccc under review 
on february  s p affirmed the debt and financial strength ratings of cna and the cna insurance companies 
the outlook was changed from creditwatch negative to stable 
this action occurred after management s discussions with s p in early january of  and upon completion of their evaluation of additional information provided to them with respect to the wtc event reserve estimate including additional sensitivity analyses of the reserve estimates and other capital adequacy analyses 
additionally  cna and s p london have agreed to a guarantee of the continental insurance company of europe cie maritime insurance co  ltd 
liabilities by ccc in order to maintain their present rating of a 
this matter is expected to be concluded by the second quarter of  as the guarantee requires the approval of the illinois department of insurance the department 
on december   moody s lowered the insurance financial strength rating of the ccc pool to a stable 
in addition  moody s lowered the cna long term debt and preferred stock ratings to baa and ba  and the continental senior debt rating to baa the previously affirmed ratings of cic  cac and commercial paper remained unchanged with the rating action 
these rating actions concluded the review begun on august  in connection with the second quarter reserve strengthening 
in light of subsequent events  management further discussed with moody s the wtc event and the fourth quarter restructuring charge 
all of these items were contemplated in their current rating opinion and outlook 
cna held million of continental preferred shares 
the million annual continental preferred share dividend was funded by cic 
although the capital position of the cic pool remains strong  cic s ability to dividend funds to its parent  continental  is limited by regulatory constraints 
in order to alleviate intercompany dividend requirements  the continental preferred stock has been converted to continental common stock in the fourth quarter of cna s ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly dependent on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends to cna by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula 
dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval of the respective state insurance departments 
dividends from the ccc pool are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the state of illinois  the domiciliary state of ccc 
under these laws  ordinary dividends  or dividends that do not require prior approval of the department  may be paid only from earned surplus  which is calculated by removing unrealized gains which under statutory accounting includes cumulative earnings of ccc s subsidiaries from unassigned surplus 
as of december   ccc is in a negative earned surplus position 
in february of  the department approved an extraordinary dividend in the amount of million to be used to fund cna s debt service requirements 
until ccc is in a positive earned surplus position  all dividends require prior approval of the department 
in addition  by agreement with the new hampshire insurance department  as well as certain other state insurance departments  dividend payments for the cic pool are restricted to internal and external debt service requirements through september up to a maximum of million annually  without the prior approval of the new hampshire insurance department 
lorillard lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation and regulatory issues 
lawsuits continue to be filed against lorillard and other manufacturers of tobacco products 
approximately  product liability cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers in the united states 
of these  approximately  cases are pending in a west virginia court  and approximately  cases are brought by flight attendants alleging injury from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the cabins of aircraft 
lorillard is a defendant in all of the flight attendant suits served to date and is a defendant in most of the cases pending in west virginia 
on july   the jury in engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco co  et al 
awarded a total of billion in punitive damages against all defendants  including billion against lorillard 
the judgment also provides that the jury s awards bear interest at the rate of per year 
lorillard remains of the view that the engle case should not have been certified as a class action 
that certification is inconsistent with the majority of federal and state court decisions which have held that mass smoking and health claims are inappropriate for class treatment 
lorillard has challenged class certification  as well as other numerous legal errors that it believes occurred during the trial 
the company and lorillard believe that an appeal of these issues on the merits should prevail 
lorillard noticed an appeal from the final judgment to the third district of the florida court of appeal and posted its appellate bond in the amount of million pursuant to florida legislation limiting the amount of an appellate bond required to be posted in order to stay execution of a judgment for punitive damages in a certified class action 
while lorillard believes this legislation is valid and that any challenges to the possible application or constitutionality of this legislation would fail  during may of  lorillard and two other defendants jointly contributed a total of million to a fund that will not be recoverable by them even if challenges to the judgment are resolved in favor of the defendants 
as a result  the class has agreed to a stay of execution on its punitive damages judgment until appellate review is completed  including any review by the us supreme court 
however  if lorillard  inc s balance sheet net worth as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect as of july  falls below million  the stay pursuant to the agreement would terminate and the class would be free to challenge the separate stay granted in favor of lorillard pursuant to florida legislation 
the florida legislation limits to million the amount of an appellate bond required to be posted in order to stay execution of a judgment for punitive damages in a certified class action 
lorillard contributed a total of million to this fund  which included the million that was initially posted as its appellate bond 
accordingly  results of operations for the year ended december   include lorillard s second quarter pretax charge of million 
the terms of the state settlement agreements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements require significant payments to be made to the settling states which began in and continue in perpetuity 
lorillard expects the cash payment to be made under the state settlement agreements in to be approximately billion 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this settlement and other litigation matters 
the principal source of liquidity for lorillard s business and operating needs is internally generated funds from its operations 
lorillard generated net cash flow from operations of approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the increased cash flow in reflects timing differences related to the cash payments for estimated taxes partially offset by the lower net income and additional cash payments related to the engle agreement 
lorillard believes that cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable it to meet its obligations under the state settlement agreements and to fund its capital expenditures 
lorillard cannot predict its cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  if necessary  and can make no assurance that it will be able to meet all of those requirements 
loews hotels in  loews hotels  with its partners  opened a second hotel at universal orlando in florida and is developing a third hotel which is scheduled to open in capital expenditures in relation to these hotel projects are being funded by a combination of equity from loews hotels and its partners  and mortgages 
funds from operations continue to exceed operating requirements 
funds for other capital expenditures and working capital requirements are expected to be provided from existing cash balances and operations 
diamond offshore there has historically been a strong correlation between the price of oil and natural gas and the demand for offshore drilling services 
as natural gas prices started to decline during the third quarter of  demand for diamond offshore s jack up fleet in the gulf of mexico began to soften 
although diamond offshore has maintained jack up fleet utilization higher than the industry average  operating dayrates earned by the fleet have deteriorated 
utilization of diamond offshore s intermediate semisubmersible fleet in the gulf of mexico  which had begun to improve during mid year  declined again during the fourth quarter 
contract renewal dayrates for these rigs have also been lower 
utilization for diamond offshore s high specification floaters has remained strong throughout however  towards the end of the year  some deep water capacity has become available in the market  and dayrates have declined slightly 
in the international markets  demand has been strong and dayrates have remained at high levels 
diamond offshore believes that continued strength in both high specification and international markets will depend  in large part  on product prices remaining at current levels 
significant relocations of drilling rigs from the weaker gulf of mexico to international markets could also lower dayrates in non us markets

during the year ended december   diamond offshore expended million  including capitalized interest expense  for rig upgrades 
these expenditures were primarily for the deepwater upgrades of the ocean baroness million and the ocean rover million 
included in this amount was million for accommodation and stability enhancement upgrades of the ocean nomad which were completed in april in addition  the pre fabrication of equipment required for the upgrade of six of diamond offshore s jack up rigs accounted for million of rig upgrade expenditures 
diamond offshore expects to spend approximately million for rig upgrade capital expenditures during which are primarily costs associated with upgrades of the ocean rover and six jack up rigs 
approximately million of this amount is expected to be used for the completion of the ocean baroness upgrade 
the significant upgrade of diamond offshore s semisubmersible  the ocean baroness  to high specification capabilities will be completed in early the approximate cost of the upgrade was million 
in january  the ocean rover arrived at a shipyard in singapore for a major upgrade to water depths and specifications similar to the enhanced ocean baroness 
the estimated cost of this upgrade is approximately million with approximately million to be spent in the upgrade is expected to take approximately months to complete with delivery estimated to occur in the third quarter of diamond offshore also plans to spend approximately million over the next two years to upgrade six of its jack up rigs 
the equipment necessary for these upgrades will be pre fabricated and installation is planned to occur during idle time or scheduled surveys to minimize downtime 
diamond offshore expects to finance these upgrades through the use of existing cash balances or internally generated funds 
during the year ended december   diamond offshore expended million for its continuing rig enhancement program and other corporate requirements 
diamond offshore has budgeted million for capital expenditures associated with these items 
cash required to meet diamond offshore s capital commitments is determined by evaluating rig upgrades to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating diamond offshore s continuing rig enhancement program  including water depth and drilling capability upgrades 
it is management s opinion that operating cash flows and diamond offshore s cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments  however  periodic assessments will be made based on industry conditions 
in addition  diamond offshore may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses  or for general corporate purposes 
diamond offshore s ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on its results of operations  its current financial and market conditions  and other factors beyond its control

the assets being held for disposition include the uk subsidiaries of cna re and certain other subsidiaries 
based upon the impairment analyses  cna anticipated that it would realize losses in connection with those planned sales 
in determining the anticipated loss from these sales  cna estimated the net realizable value of each subsidiary being held for sale 
an estimated realized loss of million after tax and minority interest was initially recorded in the second quarter of in connection with these planned dispositions 
cna completed the sale of certain subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of and updated its impairment analyses of subsidiaries still held for sale  including the united kingdom subsidiaries of cna re 
the subsidiaries sold resulted in realized losses of million after tax and minority interest  all of which was previously recognized as part of the initial impairment loss recorded in the second quarter 
the updated impairment analyses indicated that the million realized loss after tax and minority interest recorded in the second quarter of should be reduced  primarily because the net assets of cna re uk had been significantly diminished by its operating losses in the second half of in addition  cna updated its estimate of disposal costs  including anticipated capital contributions  to reflect changes in the planned structure of the anticipated sale 
these updated impairment analyses reduced the realized loss by million after tax and minority interest  including million related to the uk subsidiaries of cna re 
the anticipated sale of the uk insurance subsidiaries will be subject to regulatory approval and all anticipated sales are expected to be completed in net realized investment gains increased million in as compared with this increase is related principally to realized gains from global crossing and canary wharf

a primary objective in the management of the fixed maturity portfolio is to maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs 
in achieving this goal  assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities or credit and tax considerations 
this activity will produce realized gains and losses 
cna classifies its fixed maturity securities bonds and redeemable preferred stocks and its equity securities as available for sale  and as such  they are carried at fair value 
the amortized cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity  which are included in net investment income 
changes in fair value are reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
investments are written down to estimated fair value and losses are recognized in income when a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary 
for asset backed securities included in fixed maturity securities  cna recognizes income using a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities 
when estimates of prepayments change  the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments 
the net investment in the securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition of the securities 
such adjustments are reflected in net investment income 
mortgage loans are carried at unpaid principal balances  including unamortized premium or discount 
real estate is carried at depreciated cost 
policy loans are carried at unpaid balances 
short term investments are carried at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
other invested assets include investments in limited partnerships and certain derivative securities 
cna s limited partnership investments are recorded at fair value and typically reflect a reporting lag of up to three months 
fair value represents cna s equity in the partnership s net assets as determined by the general partner 
limited partnerships are a small portion of cna s overall investment portfolio 
the majority of the limited partnerships invest in a substantial number of securities that are readily marketable 
cna is a passive investor and does not have influence over the management of these partnerships that operate according to established guidelines and strategies 
these strategies may include the use of leverage and hedging techniques that potentially introduce more volatility and risk to the partnerships 
investments in derivative securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a component of realized gains or losses or other comprehensive income  depending on its hedge designation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is a large diversified financial services company 
as such  it and its subsidiaries have significant amounts of financial instruments that involve market risk 
the company s measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments 
changes in the trading portfolio would be recognized as investment gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the company at december  assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
the company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since the company s investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it 
the company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
equity price risk the company has exposure to equity price risk as a result of its investment in equity securities and equity derivatives 
equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes 
equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous change in the underlying reference price or index from its level at december  and  with all other variables held constant 
interest rate risk the company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
the company attempts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  commitments to purchase securities  options  futures and forwards 
the company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the company s investments and the resulting effect on shareholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on the company s earnings or shareholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the company s long term debt  including interest rate swap agreements  as of december  and is denominated in us dollars 
the company s debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of and million  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of and million  respectively 
foreign exchange rate risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
the company has foreign exchange rate exposure when it buys or sells foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
this exposure is mitigated by the company s asset liability matching strategy and through the use of futures for those instruments which are not matched 
the company s foreign transactions are primarily denominated in canadian dollars  british pounds and the european monetary unit
