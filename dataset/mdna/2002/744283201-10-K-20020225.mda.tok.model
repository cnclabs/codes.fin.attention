we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date they were made 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this annual report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we were founded in in sunnyvale  california as a vendor of radio components and related services 
in  we changed our strategy  became a designer and manufacturer of broadband wireless systems and launched our lynx broadband wireless systems 
these point to point systems are primarily used by wireless operators to connect their base stations to other base stations and to existing wire line networks 
in  we introduced our tsunami point to point broadband wireless systems  which primarily enable service providers  businesses and other enterprises to expand or establish private networks by bridging internet traffic among multiple facilities 
based on our core technologies and the technology acquired through our purchase of wirelesshome corporation in march  we are developing point to multipoint systems that will enable service providers  businesses and other enterprises to connect multiple facilities within a geographic area to a central hub 
we began shipping our first generation of these products at the end of the fourth quarter of on august   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of class a common stock at a public offering price of per share 
on august   the underwriters exercised their option to purchase  additional shares of class a common stock to cover over allotments 
the initial public offering and subsequent exercise of  shares by the underwriters resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million after payment of the underwriter s commission and deduction of offering expenses 
simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering  all of our then outstanding  shares of class b common stock and  shares of class b treasury stock were automatically converted into  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class a treasury stock  respectively 
in august  we used a portion of the net proceeds from the initial public offering to repay outstanding indebtedness 
we made the mandatory prepayment of our term notes to credit suisse first boston and also repaid all borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the total repayment including accrued interest was million 
in connection with the prepayment of our term notes  we wrote off deferred financing costs of  net of income taxes 
this transaction was accounted for as an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
subsequent event merger with proxim inc on january   we signed a merger agreement with proxim  inc proxim  headquartered in sunnyvale  california 
proxim provides wireless local area networking and building to building network products based on radio frequency technology 
under the terms of the agreement  each outstanding share of proxim common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of western multiplex common stock 
the merger is intended to qualify as a tax free reorganization 
upon completion of the merger  proxim stockholders and western multiplex stockholders will each own approximately of the combined company 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including regulatory approvals and the approval of the stockholders of both companies 
the transaction is expected to close at the end of the first calendar quarter or early in the second calendar quarter of 
table of contents revenue  net 
we primarily generate revenue from the sale of our lynx and tsunami systems 
we introduced the tsunami product line at the end of the fourth quarter of while our tsunami products and lynx products have similar pricing for comparable models  our lynx product line contributes the largest part of our revenue 
we began selling our point to multipoint systems in the last month of and have just begun to generate revenue from these products 
we also generate a small percentage of our revenue from the sale of services and parts and rentals of our systems 
we sell worldwide to service providers  businesses and other enterprises directly through our sales force and indirectly through distributors  value added resellers and system integrators 
sales to certain distributors are made under terms allowing certain rights of return  protection against subsequent price declines on our products held by our distributors and co op marketing programs 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our systems and parts when all the following conditions are met the system or part has been shipped  evidence of an arrangement exists and we have the right to invoice the customer  the collection of the receivable is probable  and we have no post delivery obligations remaining 
revenue from services  such as preinstallation diagnostic testing and product repair services  is recognized over the period for which the services are performed  which is less than one month 
revenue from product rentals is recognized over the period of the rental 
net revenue consists of product revenues reduced by estimated sales returns and allowances 
provisions for estimated sales returns and allowances  which are based on historical trends  contractual terms and other available information  are recorded at the time of sale 
our sales force focuses on key strategic accounts and also develops relationships with end users that purchase through distributors and value added resellers 
distributors sell our products  and value added resellers not only sell our products  but also assist end users in network design  installation and testing 
we also market our products through strategic relationships we have with systems integrators  which design and install networks that incorporate our systems 
any significant decline in direct sales to end users or in sales to our distributors or value added resellers  or the loss of any of our distributors or value added resellers  could materially adversely affect our revenue 
in  we sold our products to customers in countries 
in  international sales accounted for approximately of our total sales 
we expect international sales to increase as a percentage of overall sales in the future 
currently  all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to currency exchange risks other than the risk that exchange rate fluctuations may make our products more expensive for customers outside the united states and  as a result  could decrease international sales 
in addition  we face risks inherent in conducting global business 
these risks include extended collection time for receivables  reduced ability to enforce obligations and reduced protection for our intellectual property 
as we have increased sales through our distributors and value added resellers  we have experienced a decline in the average selling price of our products 
this is because the prices of the products that we sell indirectly through distributors and value added resellers are lower than the prices of the products we sell directly through our sales force to end users 
we have also lowered our prices for older products as we introduce additional products that provide faster data rates 
these newer products have higher prices than our older products 
our international sales also have lower average selling prices when compared to our united states and canadian sales 
this is primarily due to our reliance on distributors and value added resellers for international sales  and also because our lower speed products  with significantly lower prices  are being sold in larger quantities internationally than domestically 
as indirect sales and sales in our international markets increase  we expect that our average selling prices will further decrease 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of outsourced manufacturing costs  component costs  labor and overhead costs  costs of acquiring finished parts from original equipment manufacturers  customer service and accrued warranty costs 
we currently outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management to a limited number of independent contract manufacturers  who obtain components for our products from suppliers 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these contract manufacturers and component suppliers 
the remainder of our cost of revenue is related to our in house manufacturing operations  which consist primarily of quality control  final assembly  testing and product integration 
we expect to realize lower per unit product costs as we continue to outsource 
table of contents more of our in house manufacturing 
however  we cannot assure you when or if cost reductions will occur 
the failure to achieve these cost reductions could materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
gross profit 
our gross profit is affected by both the average selling prices of our systems and our cost of revenue 
historically  decreases in our average selling prices has generally been offset by reductions in our per unit product cost 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will achieve any reductions in per unit product cost in the future or that any reductions will offset a reduction in our average selling prices 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  prototype development expenses  consultant fees and allocated overhead related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products and underlying technologies 
we expense all research and development expenses as incurred 
we expect to increase our research and development expenses as we continue to develop new products and improve our core technologies 
in particular  we expect research and development expenses to increase in connection with our continued development of point to multipoint broadband wireless systems 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  product marketing  sales support functions  advertising  trade show and other promotional expenses and allocated overhead 
we intend to increase our sales and marketing expenditures as we add sales and marketing personnel  increase the number of distributors and value added resellers that sell our products and increase marketing programs 
in particular  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we substantially expand our sales operations to support and develop leads for our distributors and value added resellers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  other general corporate expenses  provision for bad debts  and allocated overhead 
we do not expect general and administrative expenses to increase in total during stock option programs 
we have implemented stock option programs for employees and members of the board of directors to attract and retain business and technical personnel 
during the year of  we recorded deferred stock compensation for the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date the stock options were granted 
this amount is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period 
the amortization expense relates to options awarded to employees in their respective operating expense categories 
recapitalization on november   ripplewood partners  lp and affiliates acquired of our capital stock from glenayre technologies  inc through a wholly owned subsidiary  wmc holding corp  in a transaction accounted for as a recapitalization 
prior to the recapitalization  we were an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of glenayre technologies  inc  which had previously acquired us in as part of glenayre s acquisition of us  glenayre recognized million of goodwill  amortized over a year useful life 
this goodwill amount  which is million in our balance sheet as of december   is reflected on our historical financial statements 
we treated the recapitalization as an asset acquisition for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  we recorded a deferred tax asset in the amount of million million as of december  which will offset future tax liabilities during the next years  assuming that we have sufficient income to realize the full benefit of this deduction 
acquisition of ubiquity communication  inc on march   we acquired ubiquity communication  inc  located in petaluma  california 
through the acquisition  we acquired technology that we planned to use to develop our point to multipoint systems 
at the time of the acquisition  ubiquity communication had seven employees  including six 
table of contents engineers 
in connection with our acquisition of ubiquity communication  we issued  shares of our class a common stock to the former owners of ubiquity communication and reserved  shares of our class a common stock for issuance upon the exercise of the ubiquity communication options we assumed 
the value of the consideration paid for the acquisition of ubiquity communication was million 
we accounted for the transaction using the purchase method of accounting 
in march  we closed the ubiquity operations due to the acquisition of wirelesshome corporation wirelesshome 
acquisition of wirelesshome on march   we acquired wirelesshome located in long beach  california in a cash and stock transaction 
wirelesshome is a development stage company that designs and develops point to multipoint systems 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
we acquired wirelesshome for a total consideration of million composed of  shares of class a common stock valued at million  cash for million  options and warrants assumed valued at million  a stock price protection contingent consideration valued at million  and transaction expenses for million 
as part of the transaction we assumed million of net liabilities  which consist of million of current assets  million of other assets and million of current liabilities 
in march  we issued an initial consideration of million 
as a result  we recorded the initial purchase price allocation as follows million to goodwill and million to deferred compensation 
goodwill related to the acquisition is being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of five years 
the initial purchase price  as well as the initial allocation  were subject to adjustments upon wirelesshome meeting certain development milestones and other considerations as defined in the agreement to acquire wirelesshome 
on october   wirelesshome met the development milestones in accordance with the acquisition agreement 
this resulted in additional purchase consideration of million 
we then evaluated and recorded the final purchase price and stock compensation expense arising from the achievement of those milestones 
the total purchase price allocation  which consists of million of purchase price and million of net liabilities assumed  was as follows million to assembled workforce  million to in process research and development  million to goodwill  and million to deferred compensation 
in addition  we recorded million of stock compensation expense as a result of releasing and issuing  shares  which were previously held in escrow  to individuals who were directly involved in the completion of the development milestones 
the purchase price allocation and intangible assets valuation was based on management s estimates of the after tax net cash flows and gave consideration to the following i the employment of a fair market value premise excluding any consideration specific to us which could result in estimates of investment value for the subject assets  ii comprehensive due diligence concerning all potential intangible assets including trademarks  tradename  patents  copyrights  non compete agreements  assembled work force  customer relationships and sales channel  and iii the value of existing technology was specifically addressed  with a view toward ensuring that the relative allocations to existing technology and in process research and development were consistent with the relative contributions of each final product 
in making its purchase price allocation  management considered present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items  an assessment of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection 
table of contents used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on management s estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
as wirelesshome replaced ubiquity in the development of our point to multipoint systems  we closed our ubiquity operations during the quarter ended march  as a result  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
the charge includes million of cash provisions  which include severance of million for employees and million for future lease commitments and exit costs related to the petaluma office facility 
as of december   approximately million of these costs was incurred with the remainder expected to be paid in the charge also includes million of non cash provisions primarily related to fixed assets and other assets that will no longer be used at the facility

s and  business combinations and goodwill and other intangibles  respectively 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas no 
 effective january   goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment  applying a fair value based test 
additionally  an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
as a result of our adoption of sfas  as of january   we will no longer amortize goodwill

amortization of deferred stock 
table of contents compensation for the year ended december  also includes million of stock compensation expense recorded in the fourth quarter in connection with the issuance of  shares to certain individuals upon wirelesshome meeting certain development milestones 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we recorded million of impairment of goodwill related to our former ubiquity operations during the first quarter of the amount of the charge equals the unamortized amount of the goodwill as of the date of the closure of the ubiquity operations  as no future benefit is anticipated since wirelesshome has replaced ubiquity as the developer of our point to multipoint systems 
restructuring charges

at the time of the wirelesshome acquisition in march  the wirelesshome technology was in an early stage of development  and the product s technical feasibility had not yet been demonstrated 
furthermore  the marketability of the potential future product was unproven 
as a result of wirelesshome meeting the development milestones in accordance with the acquisition agreement  we allocated million of the final total purchase price to in process research and development

adaptive broadband corporation reimbursed to us million of those costs 
the remaining million was recorded in operating expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest expense for both fiscal years primarily relates to term loans and a revolving credit line we entered into in november as part of the recapitalization 
in august  we repaid all borrowings outstanding under this debt 
therefore  the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the fact that our borrowings outstanding were for a shorter period in than in  and we had additional borrowings in against the revolving line of credit prior to repaying the debt 
interest income 
interest income increased from for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income is primarily due to the purchase of investments for the year ended december  resulting from net proceeds from our initial public offering in august income tax provision 
the income tax provision increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to recapitalization costs incurred during the year ended december  that were not tax deductible offset by increases in non deductible expenses during the year ended december  arising from the amortization of deferred stock compensation and goodwill 
early extinguishment of debt 
in august  we used a portion of the net proceeds from the initial public offering to repay outstanding indebtedness 
in connection with the prepayment of our term notes  we wrote off deferred financing costs of  net of income tax 
this transaction was accounted for as an extraordinary loss 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of funding has been from the net proceeds of approximately million from our initial public offering in august prior to our initial public offering  we had financed our operations and working capital requirements primarily through cash generated by our business and bank financing

we estimate approximately million of the net proceeds has not yet been used 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we have not allocated the remaining net proceeds of the offering for specific uses 
we expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds of the offering primarily for general corporate purposes  including working capital  expansion of our engineering organization  product development programs  sales and marketing capabilities  and general administrative functions and capital expenditures 
we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses  products and technologies or to establish joint ventures that we believe will complement our current or future business 
we have not identified the specific use of the remainder of the net proceeds due to the flexible nature of our planning process 
the amounts that we actually expend for general corporate and other purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including future sales growth and the amount of cash we generate from operations  if any 
pending the use of the proceeds described above  we will continue to invest the remainder of the net proceeds in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities

we intend to invest any cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing investment grade securities 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including management of working capital  the success of marketing  sales and distribution efforts  the timing of research and product development efforts and expansion of our marketing efforts 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table presents our operating results for each of the eight quarters in the period ending december  the information for each of these quarters is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes

our quarterly results may fluctuate for many reasons  including the following seasonal factors that may affect capital spending by customers  the timing of sales of our products  the mix of products sold because our products generate different gross margins  
table of contents our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and to manage product transitions  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of components for our products for which our contract manufacturers have a sole supply source or require a long lead time to produce  cost pressures from shortages of skilled technical  sales and marketing employees  increased product development and other factors  a failure to achieve cost reductions  a decrease in the average selling prices of our products  delays in deliveries to distributors  value added resellers and other customers  and manufacturing capacity constraints  which affect our ability to fulfill orders 
we have experienced disruptions in our operations from some of the factors listed above and may experience them again 
in addition  we are dependent on decisions by service providers  businesses and other enterprises to build wireless networks 
these decisions are in turn dependent upon the success and expected demand for the services offered by those service providers  businesses and other enterprises 
we plan to increase significantly our operating expenses to fund greater levels of research and development  expand our sales and marketing operations  broaden our customer support capabilities and develop new relationships with distributors and value added resellers 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends  and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the short term 
as a result  any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
due to the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock may fall 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows estimating sales returns and allowances  estimating other allowances  specifically  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty costs  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
estimating sales returns and allowances 
we sell worldwide to service providers  businesses and other enterprises directly through our sales force and indirectly through distributors  value added resellers and system integrators 
sales to certain distributors are made under terms allowing certain rights of return  protection against subsequent price declines on our products held by our distributors 
in  and  sales to distributors of our products accounted for approximately  and of net revenue 
net revenue consists of product revenue reduced by estimated sales returns and allowances 
provisions for estimated sales returns and allowances  which are based on historical trends  contractual terms and other available information  are recorded at the time of sale 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to product revenue in the current period 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
to 
table of contents estimate potential product returns from distributors  management analyzes historical returns  the distributor inventory levels  the sales out of the distributors  and the specific contractual return rights of each distributor 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
other sales related estimates include our allowance for sales discounts and rebates which we identify and reserve for specifically at the time such discounts and rebates are given 
our allowances for sales returns and other sales related reserve were million as of december  estimating other allowances 
the preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to million  as of december  management must make estimates of potential future excess and obsolete inventory and product warranty costs 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production based on demand forecasts  current economic trends  and historical write offs when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
when evaluating the reserve for warranty costs  management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage  historical return rates  historical costs of repair  knowledge of new products introduced and current economic trends 
material differences in estimates of excess and obsolete inventory and product warranty costs may result in the amount and timing of cost of sales for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory and product warranty costs were million and  respectively  as of december  accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we recorded a net deferred tax asset of approximately million at december   of which approximately million related to net operating losses generated during the current year which expire on december   as well as approximately million in tax credits which expire at various dates beginning in although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through refunds from the carryback of the current year net operating loss and the generation of future taxable income 
although the deferred tax asset is considered realizable  actual amounts could be reduced if sufficient future taxable income is not achieved 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
seasonality historically  our revenues have been higher in the last two quarters of the fiscal year 
in addition our revenues have historically been significantly higher in the last month of each quarter 
this shift may primarily be attributed to the budgetary constraints of the customers in our industry and weather conditions that make an outdoor installation more difficult during the winter 
however  going forward  we believe the impact of seasonal fluctuations on our business will decrease because demand for our products is increasing at a rate that outpaces any budget restrictions our customers may have 
moreover  our expansion into international markets may minimize the impact that weather conditions may have on our overall sales 
risk factors this annual report on form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this form k 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

table of contents sales of our products could decline if customer relationships are disrupted by the proposed merger with proxim 
the merger may have the effect of disrupting customer relationships 
our customers may not continue their current buying patterns during the pendency of  and following  the merger 
customers may defer purchasing decisions as they evaluate the likelihood of our successful integration or may instead purchase products of competitors 
any significant delay or reduction in orders for our products could cause sales of our products to decline 
we are not profitable and may not be profitable in the future 
we had a net loss from operations of approximately million for the year ended december  we cannot assure you that revenue will increase or continue at current levels or growth rates or that we will achieve profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited history of producing many of our current products  period to period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicating what our future performance will be 
we expect that we will continue to incur significant sales  marketing  product development and administrative expenses 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability and we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future 
any failure to significantly increase our revenue as we implement our product and distribution strategies will harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may experience fluctuations in operating results and may not be able to adjust spending in time to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall which may cause operating results to fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which will be outside our control 
we may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to planned expenditures could materially harm our operating results and financial condition  and may cause operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this happens  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 
factors that may harm operating results include the effectiveness of our distribution channels  and our success in maintaining current distribution channels and developing new distribution channels  our ability to effectively manage the development of new business segments and markets  our ability to successfully manage the integration of operations  market demand for our point to point lynx and tsunami systems  market demand for our point to multipoint systems  technical difficulties  system downtime or other similar failures  our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure  difficulties in expanding and conducting international operations  and general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the wireless communications industry 
historically  we have not operated with a significant order backlog and a substantial portion of our revenues in any quarter has been derived from orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
accordingly  a significant component of revenue expectations will be based almost entirely on internal estimates of future 
table of contents demand and not on firm customer orders 
planned operating expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based in large part on these estimates 
if orders and revenue do not meet expectations  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
shares eligible for future sale  including shares owned by our principal stockholders  may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
the potential for sales of substantial amounts of our common stock into the public market may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
approximately million shares are held by affiliates of ripplewood holdings llc and an aggregate of approximately million shares are held by jonathan zakin  who is our chairman and chief executive officer  and michael seedman  who is currently a member of our board of directors  and their respective affiliates 
in the event that the affiliates of ripplewood holdings llc distribute shares that they hold to their members and partners that are not our affiliates  those distributed shares could be immediately sold without regard to any volume limitations 
competition within the wireless networking industry is intense and is expected to increase significantly 
our failure to compete successfully could materially harm our prospects and financial results 
the market for broadband wireless systems and building to building markets is extremely competitive and we expect that competition will intensify in the future 
increased competition could adversely affect our business and operating results through pricing pressures  the loss of market share and other factors 
the principal competitive factors affecting broadband fixed wireless markets include the following data throughput  interference immunity  network security  price  integration with voice technology  power consumption  product reliability  ease of use  product costs  product features and applications  product time to market  product certifications  changes to government regulations with respect to each country served and related to the use of radio spectrum  brand recognition  oem partnerships  marketing alliances  manufacturing capabilities and experience  effective distribution channels  and company reputation 
we could be at a disadvantage to competitors  particularly agere systems  alvarion cisco systems which acquired aironet wireless communications  netro  nokia  p com  proxim  symbol technologies  
table of contents wi lan inc and com that have broader distribution channels  brand recognition  extensive patent portfolios and more diversified product lines 
many of our present and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and distribution of their products 
these competitors may succeed in establishing technology standards or strategic alliances in the broadband fixed wireless market  obtain more rapid market acceptance for their products  or otherwise gain a competitive advantage 
we can offer no assurance we will succeed in developing products or technologies that are more effective than those developed by our competitors 
furthermore  we compete with companies that have high volume manufacturing and extensive marketing and distribution capabilities  areas in which we have only limited experience 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing and new competitors as wireless markets evolve and the level of competition increases 
we recently began shipping our first generation point to multipoint systems 
these products have not been in the market long enough to determine if they work effectively or if they will be a commercial success 
we believe our future prospects are dependent on our ability to successfully enter the point to multipoint market 
if we are unable to successfully distribute our point to multipoint systems  it will be difficult for us to compete successfully in the broadband wireless access market 
historically  our operations have focused on the point to point segment of the broadband wireless access market 
in an effort to remain competitive and grow our business  we have recently decided to enter the point to multipoint segment of the market 
through our acquisition of wirelesshome corporation  we acquired point to multipoint technology and recently began to ship products employing this technology 
if our point to multipoint products are not commercially successful  our future prospects and competitive position will be materially harmed 
furthermore  some of our competitors are selling point to multipoint broadband wireless access systems already  and there is often an advantage to companies that are among the first to introduce new products 
if our point to multipoint systems are not competitive  it may be difficult for us to attract new customers 
to remain competitive  we will need to expand our operations 
failure to effectively manage growth could result in our inability to support and maintain our operations 
we anticipate that we will need to expand our operations in order to address new market opportunities for our products 
this expansion could place a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
we cannot assure you that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations  our management will be able to identify  hire  train  motivate or manage required personnel  or our management will be able to successfully identify and exploit existing and potential market opportunities 
in response to the recent decline in demand for wireless networks generally  we reduced the size of our work force 
those reductions may hinder our ability to expand our operations in response to new market opportunities or a sudden growth in demand for our products 
in addition  we could experience lower earnings as a result of expenses associated with growing our operations  whether through internal development or through acquisitions 
we depend on international sales and our ability to sustain or expand international sales is subject to many risks  which could adversely affect our operating results 
revenue from our shipments to customers outside of the united states  principally to a limited number of distributors  represented  and of total revenue during the calendar years  and  respectively 
we expect that revenue from shipments to international customers will vary as a percentage of total revenue 

table of contents there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets  including the following uncertainty of product acceptance by customers in foreign countries  export license and documentation requirements  unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations  governmental restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the united states  foreign currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles for international distributors  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  tariffs  duties  taxes and other trade barriers  difficulties in finding foreign licensees or joint venture partners  and potential political and economic instability 
there is a risk that such factors will harm our ability to continue to successfully operate internationally and our efforts to expand our international operations 
there can be no assurance that foreign markets will continue to develop or that we will receive additional orders to supply our products to foreign customers 
our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected if foreign markets do not continue to develop or if we do not receive additional orders to supply our products for use by foreign customers 
there is a risk that our business may start to grow and that we will not have enough employees to meet the increased demand for our products 
to successfully expand international sales  we will need to recruit additional international sales and support personnel and expand our relationships with international distributors and value added resellers 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we may incur these additional costs and add these management burdens without successfully expanding sales 
this failure would cause profitability to decline or losses to increase 
our revenue may decline and our profitability may be threatened if the demand for wireless services in general and broadband wireless access systems in particular does not continue to grow 
our success is dependent on continued growth in demand for wireless telecommunications and data communications services 
if the rate of growth slows and service providers reduce their capital investments in wireless infrastructure or fail to expand into new geographic markets  our revenue will decline 
unlike some competitors such as cisco and nortel  among others  our principal product offerings rely on wireless technologies 
accordingly  we would experience a greater impact from a decline in the demand for wireless services than some of our most important competitors 
in addition  wireless access solutions are unproven in the marketplace and some of the wireless technologies  such as our tsunami point to multipoint technology in which we are currently investing substantial capital  have only been commercially introduced in the last few years 
if wireless access technology turns out to be unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment  it is unlikely we could generate enough sales to sustain profitability 
we have listed below the factors that we believe are key to the success or failure of broadband wireless access technology its reliability and security and the perception by end users of its reliability and security  its capacity to handle growing demands for faster transmission of increasing amounts of data  voice and video  the availability of sufficient frequencies for network service providers to deploy products at commercially reasonable rates  
table of contents its cost effectiveness and performance compared to other forms of broadband access  whose prices and performance continue to improve  its suitability for a sufficient number of geographic regions  and the availability of sufficient site locations for network service providers to install products at commercially reasonable rates 
we have experienced the effects of many of the factors listed above in interactions with customers selecting wireless versus wire line technology 
for example  because of the frequency with which individuals using cellular phones experience fading or a loss of signal  customers often hold the perception that all broadband wireless technologies will have the same reliability constraints even though the wireless technology we use does not have the same problems as cellular phones 
in some geographic areas  because of adverse weather conditions that affect wireless transmissions  but not wire line technologies  we are not able to sell products as successfully as competitors with wire line technology 
in addition  future legislation  legal decisions and regulation relating to the wireless telecommunications industry may slow or delay the deployment of wireless networks 
we may also lose customers to different types of wireless technologies 
for example  we have only a limited offering of products that operate in licensed radio spectrums 
some customers  however  may want to operate in licensed radio spectrums because such spectrums sometimes offer less interference than license free radio spectrums or have other advantages 
our business will depend on rapidly evolving telecommunications and internet industries 
our future success is dependent upon the continued growth of the data communications and wireless industries  particularly with regard to internet usage 
the global data communications and internet industries are evolving rapidly and it is difficult to predict potential growth rates or future trends in technology development 
we cannot assure you that the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide telecommunications market that has resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services will continue in a manner favorable to us or our business strategies 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the growth in demand for wireless and internet services  and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced data communications products and wireless systems  will continue at its current rate or at all 
we currently derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of distributors 
therefore  a decrease or loss in business from any of them may cause a significant delay or decline in our revenue and could harm our reputation 
we currently generate a significant amount of revenue from a limited number of distributors 
the loss of business from any of these distributors or the delay of significant orders from any of them  even if only temporary  could significantly reduce our revenue  delay recognition of revenue  harm our reputation or reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was derived from one distributor 
for the year ended december   approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from three distributors 
we do not have long term contracts with any of these distributors 
our future success will depend significantly on the timing and size of future purchase orders  if any  from a limited number of distributors 
we depend on limited suppliers for key components that are difficult to manufacture  and because we do not have long term arrangements with these suppliers  we could experience disruptions in supply that could decrease or delay the recognition of revenues 
we depend on single or limited source suppliers for several key components used in our products 
any disruptions in the supply of these components could delay or decrease our revenues 
in addition  even for components with multiple sources  there have been  and may continue to be  shortages due to capacity constraints caused by high demand 
we do not have any long term arrangements with our suppliers 
if  for any reason  a supplier fails to meet its quantity or quality requirements  or stops selling components to its contract manufacturers at commercially reasonable prices  we could experience significant production delays and cost 
table of contents increases  as well as higher warranty expenses and product reputation problems 
because the key components and assemblies of our products are complex  difficult to manufacture and require long lead times  we may have difficulty finding alternative suppliers to produce our components and assemblies on a timely basis 
we have experienced shortages of some of these components in the past  which delayed related revenue  and we may experience shortages in the future 
in addition  because the majority of our products have a short sales cycle of between and days  we may have difficulty in making accurate and reliable forecasts of product needs 
as a result  we could experience shortages in supply  which could delay or decrease revenue because our customers may cancel their orders or choose a competitor for their future needs 
we have limited manufacturing capability and depend on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing requirements 
we currently have limited manufacturing capability and no experience in large scale or foreign manufacturing 
if our customers were to concurrently place orders for unexpectedly large product quantities  our present manufacturing capacity might be inadequate to meet the demand 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or contract for additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms on a timely basis 
in addition  in order to compete successfully  we will need to achieve significant product cost reductions 
although we intend to achieve cost reductions through engineering improvements  production economies  and manufacturing at lower cost locations including outside the united states  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in order to remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new products and processes into our manufacturing environment  and there can be no assurance that any such new products will not create obsolete inventories related to older products 
we have in the past experienced higher than expected demand for our products 
this resulted in delays in the delivery of certain products due to temporary shortages of certain components  particularly components with long lead times  and insufficient manufacturing capacity 
due to the complex nature of products and manufacturing processes  the worldwide demand for some wireless technology components and other factors  there can be no assurance that delays in the delivery of products will not occur in the future 
the average selling prices of our products have been declining  and we may be unable to achieve the manufacturing cost reductions and improvements required in order to remain profitable 
the average selling price of our products has been declining in recent years 
if we do not reduce production costs and other expenses  we may not be able to offset this continuing decline and achieve or maintain profitability 
we must also develop and introduce on a timely basis new systems that can be sold at higher average selling prices 
failure to develop these new products would cause our revenue to decline or to increase more slowly 
we expect that average selling prices of our products will continue to decrease because one of our strategies will be to increase the percentage of domestic and international sales being made through distributors and value added resellers  and to oem customers  which involve lower prices than our direct sales 
this risk from declining average selling prices may also intensify because we expect that market conditions  particularly falling prices for competing broadband solutions  will force us to reduce prices over time 
under some circumstances  we may be forced to reduce prices even if it causes us to decrease gross profit or to take a loss on our products 
we may also be unable to reduce sufficiently the cost of our products to enable us to compete with other broadband access technologies with lower product costs 
in order to remain competitive  we will need to design our products so that they can be manufactured with low cost  automated manufacturing  assembly and testing techniques 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in designing our products to allow contract manufacturers to use lower cost  automated techniques 
in addition  any redesign may fail to result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to significantly reduce the price of our products or prevent our gross profit from declining as prices decline 

table of contents because many of our current and planned products are or will be highly complex  they may contain defects or errors that are detected only after deployment in complex networks and which  if detected  could harm our reputation and result in a decrease in revenue or in difficulty collecting accounts receivable 
many of our complex products can only be fully tested when deployed in commercial networks 
as a result  end users may discover defects or errors or experience breakdowns in their networks after the products have been deployed 
the occurrence of any defects or errors in these products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance and loss of market share  cancellation of orders  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  increased service and warranty costs  diversion of resources  legal actions by customers and end users  and increased insurance costs and other losses to us or to end users 
end users have discovered errors in our products in the past and may discover errors in these products in the future 
because customers often delay deployment of a full system until the products have been tested by them and any defects have been corrected  these revisions caused delays in orders by our customers for our systems 
because our strategy is to introduce more complex products in the future  this risk will intensify over time 
to compete effectively  we will need to establish and expand new distribution channels for our point to multipoint products 
we intend to add new distributors and value added resellers for our tsunami point to multipoint products 
our point to multipoint products are sold through our current domestic and international distributors 
in general  distributors and value added resellers offer products of several different companies  including products that may compete with our products 
accordingly  they may give higher priority to products of other suppliers  thus reducing their efforts to sell our products 
in addition  they often focus on specific markets and we will need to add new distributors and value added resellers as we expand our sales to new markets 
agreements with distributors are generally terminable at their option 
any reduction in sales efforts or termination of a relationship may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
use of distributors also entails the risk that they will build up inventories in anticipation of substantial growth in sales 
if such growth does not occur as anticipated  they may substantially decrease the amount of products ordered in subsequent quarters 
such fluctuations could contribute to significant variations in our future operating results 
broadband wireless access solutions have some disadvantages and limitations as compared to other alternative broadband access solutions that may prevent widespread adoption  which could hurt our profitability and prospects 
broadband wireless access solutions  including point to point and point to multipoint systems  compete with other high speed access solutions such as digital subscriber lines  cable modem technology  fiber optic cable and other high speed wire line and satellite technologies 
if the market for our point to point and point to multipoint solutions fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect due to this competition  our sales opportunities and profitability will be harmed 
many of these alternative technologies can take advantage of existing installed infrastructure and are generally perceived to be reliable and secure 
as a result  they have already achieved significantly greater market acceptance and penetration than point to point and point to multipoint broadband wireless access technologies 
moreover  current point to point and point to multipoint broadband wireless access technologies have inherent technical limitations that may inhibit their widespread adoption in many areas  including the need for line of sight installation and  in the case of operating frequencies above ghz  reduced communication distance in bad weather 

table of contents we expect point to point and point to multipoint broadband wireless access technologies to face increasing competitive pressures from both current and future alternative technologies 
in light of these factors  many service providers may be reluctant to invest heavily in broadband wireless access solutions 
broadband wireless access products require a direct line of sight  which may limit the ability of service providers to deploy them in a cost effective manner and could harm our sales 
because of line of sight limitations  service providers often install broadband wireless access equipment on the rooftops of buildings and on other tall structures 
before undertaking these installations  service providers must generally secure roof rights from the owners of each building or other structure on which the equipment is to be installed 
the inability to easily and cost effectively obtain roof rights may deter customers from choosing to install broadband wireless access equipment  which could have an adverse effect on our sales 
if we fail to attract  hire and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to develop  market or sell our products or successfully manage our business 
competition for personnel in our industry and in northern california where we are located is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
we depend on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any key personnel or our inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills could restrict our ability to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely manner  sell products to our customers or manage our business effectively 
there are only a limited number of people in the job market with the requisite skills  particularly people with radio frequency technology expertise 
we may not be able to hire or retain qualified personnel if we are unable to offer competitive salaries and benefits in the northern california labor market 
in addition  as a public company  we may find it more difficult to attract personnel and we may have to increase compensation 
we are also dependent on the continued contributions of our principal sales  engineering and management personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we may have difficulties with our acquisitions and investments  which could adversely affect our growth and financial condition 
from time to time  we may consider new business opportunities and ventures  including acquisitions  in a broad range of areas 
any decision by us to pursue a significant business expansion or new business opportunity would be accompanied by risks  including  among others requiring us to invest a substantial amount of capital  which could materially harm our financial condition and our ability to implement our existing business strategy  requiring us to issue additional equity interests  which would be dilutive to our stockholders  placing additional and substantial burdens on our management personnel and our financial and operational systems  the difficulty of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the possible inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  potential additional expenses associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets or the impairment of goodwill  additional expenses associated with the activities and expansion of the acquired businesses  and the possible impairment of relationships with existing employees  customers  suppliers and investors 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions or other investments that we may make in the future 

table of contents if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or if such rights are not adequately protected under current law  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks and this could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase costs 
we will rely on intellectual property laws to protect the products that we own  develop and license 
we will also rely on confidentiality agreements with some of our licensees and other third parties and confidentiality agreements and policies covering our employees 
we cannot assure you that such laws and measures will provide sufficient protection  that other companies will not develop technologies that are similar or superior or that third parties will not copy or otherwise obtain and use our technologies without authorization 
possible third party claims of infringement of proprietary rights against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
the communications industry is characterized by a relatively high level of litigation based on allegations of infringement of proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us  that any such assertion of infringement will not result in litigation or that we would prevail in such litigation 
furthermore  any such claims  with or without merit  could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our personnel  require us to develop new technology or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against us  and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or to license the infringed  misappropriated or similar technology at a reasonable cost  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may be obligated to indemnify our customers against claimed infringement of patents  trademarks  copyrights and other proprietary rights of third parties 
any requirement for us to indemnify our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
compliance with governmental regulations in multiple jurisdictions where we sell our products is difficult and costly 
our products are also subject to regulatory requirements in domestic and international markets and  therefore  we must monitor the development of spread spectrum and other radio frequency regulations domestically and in certain countries that represent potential markets for our products 
regulatory changes by the fcc or by regulatory agencies outside the united states  including changes in the allocation of available frequency spectrum  could significantly affect our operations by restricting our development efforts  rendering current products obsolete or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
several changes by the fcc were approved within the last eight years including changes in the allocation and use of available frequency spectrum  as well as the granting of an interim waiver 
these approved changes could create opportunities for other wireless networking products and services 
there can be no assurance that new regulations will not be promulgated that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
changes in  or the failure by us to comply with  applicable domestic and international regulations could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
in addition  with respect to those countries that do not follow fcc regulations  we may need to modify our products to meet local rules and regulations 
it is possible that the united states and other jurisdictions will adopt new laws and regulations affecting the pricing  characteristics and quality of broadband wireless systems and products 
increased government regulations could decrease the growth of the broadband wireless industry  hinder our ability to conduct business internationally  reduce our revenues  increase the costs of our products  
table of contents increase our operating expenses  and expose us to significant liabilities 
the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuation  and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock
