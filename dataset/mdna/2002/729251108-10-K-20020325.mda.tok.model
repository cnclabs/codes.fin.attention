item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private litigation reform act of some of the forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words such as believes  expects  may  will  should  seeks  approximately  intends  plans  estimates  projects  strategy or anticipates or the negative of those words or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements  including those factors in risk factors 
some factors include changes in governmental  legislative and environmental restrictions  catastrophic losses from fires  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  insect infestations or diseases  as well as changes in economic conditions and competition in our domestic and export markets and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contemplated by our projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted results as reflected in forward looking statements relating to our operations and business include  but are not limited to our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or reit  or our failure to achieve the expected competitive advantages of operating as a reit  an unanticipated reduction in the demand for timber products and or an unanticipated increase in the supply of timber products  our failure to make strategic acquisitions or to integrate any such acquisitions effectively or  conversely  our failure to make strategic divestitures  and the failure to meet our expectations with respect to our likely future performance 
accordingly  actual results may not conform to the forward looking statements contained in this report 
overview merger with the timber company 
on october   the six entities that comprised the timber company  formerly a separate operating group of georgia pacific corporation georgia pacific  merged with and into plum creek  with plum creek as the surviving company 
as a part of the merger  the shareholders of georgia pacific corporation timber group common stock timber company stock received shares of plum creek s common stock for each share of the timber company stock  or approximately million shares 
the merger is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition  with the timber company being treated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
as a consequence  the historical financial statements of the timber company became the financial statements of plum creek effective as of the consummation of the merger 
therefore  the statement of income for the year ended december  reflects the performance of the timber company until the date of the merger and that of the merged company for the remainder of the statements of income for the years ended december  and january  reflect only the operating results of the timber company 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
prior to the merger with plum creek  the timber company had only one reportable segment 
subsequent to the merger  plum creek has five reportable segments 
the timber company s historical segment information has been retroactively restated back to the beginning of to reflect these new segments 
furthermore  the period to period comparison of the results of operations for compared to and compared to are based on the new segments and reflect the operating results of the timber company through the merger date october  and the results of the combined company subsequent to the merger date 
see note of the notes to financial statements for segment and geographical area information 
additionally  in connection with the merger  plum creek replaced approximately million of georgia pacific debt attributed to the timber company with third party debt  consisting of million of fixed rate 
table of contents debt and million of variable rate debt 
also in connection with the merger  plum creek assumed approximately million outstanding stock options after adjusting for the exchange ratio with respect to timber company stock at exercise prices ranging from to after adjusting for the exchange ratio 
see notes and of the notes to financial statements 
commencing july   plum creek has elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the united states internal revenue code 
as a consequence of the timber company merging into a reit  a one time tax benefit of approximately million was recorded to reflect the elimination of a deferred tax liability associated with temporary differences primarily related to timberlands that are not expected to be disposed of in a transaction subject to built in gains tax during a ten year period 
additionally  in connection with the merger  plum creek inherited the earnings and profits of the timber company 
as a reit  plum creek was required to distribute these earnings and profits prior to january  as a result  our fourth quarter dividend of per share was accelerated and paid on december  the dividend normally would have been paid in february see note of the notes to financial statements 
non recurring items 
during we had the following non recurring items which had an impact on our results of operations income tax benefit 
as a result of the entities comprising the timber company  each a taxable corporation  merging into plum creek  a reit  which is generally not subject to federal or state income tax  a one time tax benefit of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the benefit relates primarily to the elimination of a deferred tax liability associated with temporary differences primarily related to timberlands that are not expected to be disposed of in a transaction subject to built in gains tax during a ten year period 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
severance 
in connection with the october  merger  the employment of several executives and key employees of the timber company terminated 
terminated employees were paid a severance and two terminated executives of the timber company were awarded additional pension benefits 
an expense of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of for these severance and pension benefits 
accounting method change 
in the fourth quarter of  the company changed its accounting policy to capitalize certain timber reforestation costs that were previously expensed 
the cumulative effect of this policy change is not reflected in the beginning balance of timber and timberlands because information is not available to compute the cumulative effect of the change over the prior harvest cycle of approximately years 
the new capitalization policy was applied retroactively as of january  implementation of the new accounting policy increased the northern resources segment s operating income by million and the southern resources segment s operating income by million

off balance sheet debt and other arrangements 
the consolidated financial statements of the company reflect all of the operations and assets and liabilities of the company 
the company has no relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
consequently  the company has no off balance sheet debt 
furthermore  except for a financing in connection with certain installment notes receivable which were transferred to georgia pacific prior to the october  merger  the company is not a party to any derivative transactions 
finally  the company does not have any transactions with related parties or affiliates other than those described in note of the notes to financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgements and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
plum creek the timber company prior to the october  merger historically recognized revenue from timber sales under three different methods  depending upon the terms of the sale 
the methods were delivered log sales  cutting contracts and timber deeds 
under a delivered log sale agreement  the seller cuts the tree and delivers it to the buyer 
risk of loss and title to the tree passes to the buyer when the log is delivered to the buyer 
revenue is recognized when the log is delivered and includes the cost of logging and hauling 
cutting contacts are agreements where the buyer agrees to harvest all of the trees on a tract of land for an agreed upon price for each of the different types of trees over the terms of the contract usually to months 
in some cases an advance is received in connection with cutting contracts  and in other cases the buyer agrees to only cut certain trees on a tract of land 
under cutting contracts  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
title and risk of loss pass to the buyer as the trees are cut 
revenue is recognized when the trees are cut 
total revenue recognized under a cutting contract is a function of the total volume of wood removed times the agreed upon per unit price for each of the various types of trees on a tract of land 
timber deeds are agreements where the buyer agrees to harvest all of the trees on a tract of land over the terms of the contract usually to months 
however  unlike a cutting contract  risk of loss and title to the trees transfer to the buyer when the contract is signed 
the buyer also pays the full purchase price when the contract is signed 
under a timber deed  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue from a timber deed sale is recognized when the contract is signed 
timber deeds are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on a timber cruise an estimate of the total volume of timber on a tract of land broken down by the various types of trees such as softwood sawlogs  hardwood pulpwood  etc total revenue recognized under a timber deed is the amount of the highest bid and is not dependent upon the volume or types of trees actually harvested 
subsequent to the october  merger  as a result of certain reit requirements  we have replaced timber deed agreements with lump sum sale agreements 
under a lump sum sale  the parties agree to a lump sum price for all the timber available for harvest on a tract of land 
generally the lump sum price is paid when the contract is signed 
however  unlike timber deeds  title to the timber and risk of loss transfers to the buyer as the timber is cut 
therefore  revenue is recognized each month based on the timber harvested compared to total timber available to be harvested on a tract of land over the terms of the contract usually to months 
under a lump sum sale  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
lump sum sales are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on timber cruise information 
total revenue recognized under a lump sum sale contract is the amount of the highest bid and is not dependent upon the volume or type of trees actually harvested 
since revenue is recognized under a lump sum sale agreement as the trees are cut  an estimate of how much revenue to recognize each month is made based on how much volume has been removed compared to the total volume available for harvest on a tract of land according to the timber cruise 
we generally receive weekly information from the buyer regarding how much volume has been removed 
inevitably  the total volume harvested from a tract of land will be different than the volume estimated in the timber cruise 
if the total volume removed is greater than the cruised volume  we will stop recognizing revenue on this contract once the total revenue recognized is equal to total lump sum contract price 
no revenue will be recognized for volumes harvested in excess of the cruised volume 
if the total volume removed is less than the cruised volume  an 
table of contents adjustment will be recorded in the month in which the buyer has completed its harvesting on a tract of land 
the adjustment is an increase in revenue equal to the difference between the lump sum contract price and the total revenue recognized under this contract to date 
management does not expect to have any material adjustments to revenue recognized under lump sum sales agreements 
management expects that actual volumes harvested under lump sum contracts will not be materially different than the estimated cruised volumes 
furthermore  management estimates that the likelihood of actual volume harvested exceeding the cruised volume is approximately equal to the likelihood of actual volume harvested being less than the cruised volume 
however  we have limited experience with lump sum contracts and we may need  therefore  to refine our estimation process in future periods 
while the timing of when revenue is recognized under a timber deed and a lump sum contract is materially different  this change is not expected to have a material impact on the year to year comparison of our results of operations 
however  our quarter to quarter comparison of our results of operations is expected to be materially impacted 
the majority of our timber sales in the northern resources segment are under delivered log sale agreements 
in our southern resources segment  the majority of our timber sales are either cutting contracts or lump sum sales 
under both cutting contracts and lump sum sales  the buyer is responsible for the logging and hauling costs 
therefore  operating profit percentages are significantly higher in our southern resources segment 
real estate sales 
as a major landowner  we estimate that of the company s timberlands may be better suited for conservation  residential or recreational purposes rather than for long term commercial timber management 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the availability of government and not for profit funding  the general state of the economy  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation and the timing of harvesting activities 
furthermore  from time to time we dispose of large non strategic timberland holdings  which may result in material gains and losses from real estate sales 
as a result  our reported operating income and net income may be materially impacted by the timing of our real estate sales 
historically  our real estate segment has reported significant operating profit percentages ranging from to of revenues  and this trend is expected to continue in the future 
the high operating profit percentages are primarily because a significant portion of our timberlands was acquired many years ago 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the annual appreciation in our timberlands cannot be reflected in our earnings until the year in which the properties are sold 
furthermore  in connection with major timberland acquisitions we are generally not able to identify our future real estate sales 
this was the case in our october  merger with the timber company 
since the merger is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition  the timberlands of plum creek were recorded at their fair value 
however  while our purchase price allocation and related appraisals reflect greater values for real estate which may be sold in the future for uses which have a higher value than timber production  we are generally not able to identify specific properties 
therefore  within each region  except for properties which we were able to identify specifically  we allocated this higher value proportionately among all the acres acquired 
in general  specific properties cannot be identified in advance because their value is dependent upon numerous factors  most of which are not known at the acquisition date  including current and future zoning restrictions  current and future environmental restrictions  future changes in demographics  future changes in the economy  current and future plans of adjacent landowners  and current and future funding of government and not for profit conservation and recreation programs 
management believes that current and future results of operations could be materially different under different purchase price allocation assumptions  and it does not believe that it has the ability  with any level of precision  to estimate which of our properties will someday sell for more than their underlying timber production value 

table of contents depletion 
depletion  or costs attributed to timber harvested  is recorded as trees are harvested 
depletion rates for each region are adjusted annually 
depletion rates are computed by dividing a the sum of the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion plus estimated future silviculture costs that are expected to be incurred over the next harvest cycle  by b the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle 
the harvest cycle can be as short as years in the south and as long as years in the rockies 
the estimate of future silviculture costs is limited to the expenditures that are expected to impact growth rates over the harvest cycle 
the depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for either future reforestation costs associated with a stand s final harvest or future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest 
significant estimates and judgements are required to determine both future silviculture costs and the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle 
some of the factors impacting the estimates are changes in weather patterns  inflation rates  the cost of fertilizers and chemicals  the cost of capital  the actual and estimated increase in growth rates from fertilizer applications  the relative price of sawlogs and pulpwood  the actual and expected real price appreciation of timber  the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology  and changes in harvest cycles 
the company has invested in technology that enables it to predict its current standing inventory of trees  future growth rates  and the benefits of scientific advancements in connection with seedlings  planting techniques and fertilizer applications 
therefore  while estimates with respect to depletion computations will be revised annually  management does not expect the depletion rates will change materially from year to year 
deferred income taxes 
plum creek has elected to be taxed as a reit under sections of the united states internal revenue code commencing july  a reit is generally not subject to corporate level tax if it satisfies certain requirements 
on october   the timber company  consisting of a group of corporate entities  merged with and into plum creek 
as a consequence of the merger of a taxable entity into a nontaxable entity  the deferred tax liabilities of the timber company are eliminated except for any expected transactions that would be subject to built in gains tax 
plum creek will generally be subject to corporate level tax built in gains tax to the extent it disposes of certain property of the timber company that it acquired in the merger during a ten year period following the merger 
the built in gains tax only applies to gains from such asset sales to the extent the fair value of the property exceeds its tax basis at the merger date 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  a one time tax benefit of approximately million was recorded by the company in the fourth quarter of as a result of the merger of the timber company into plum creek 
the benefit of approximately million represents the elimination of a deferred tax liability associated with temporary differences primarily related to timberlands that are not expected to be disposed of in a transaction subject to built in gains tax during a ten year period following the merger 
management estimated that approximately of the timber company s timberlands will be sold in a taxable transaction over the next ten years 
as a result  approximately million of deferred taxes related to timberlands were not eliminated during the fourth quarter of it is likely that actual timberland sales over the ten year built in gain period will be greater than  or less than  
an adjustment to earnings will be required in the period in which it is determined that timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax will be greater than  or less than  
long term incentive plans 
plum creek has a stock incentive plan that provides for the award of non qualified stock options  restricted stock  dividend equivalents and value management awards 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
value management awards provide incentive compensation to participants over a three year period that is contingent upon performance measured against the performance of a peer group of forest products companies 
value management awards are earned in whole or in part based on a sliding scale 
no value management award is earned if the company s total stockholder return is below the th percentile of the peer group 
the full value management award is earned if the company s total stockholder return is above the th percentile 

table of contents plum creek recognizes compensation expense for value management awards based on the expected value of the award upon vesting and accrues the expense over the vesting period 
the actual expense cannot be determined until the end of the three year performance period 
furthermore  since the amount of the award  if any  is based on plum creek s relative performance compared to that of its peer group  it is possible to have significant changes to the estimated award value during the performance period 
compensation expense related to the value management awards is adjusted in the quarter in which there has been a material change in the expected vested value of the awards 
therefore  it is possible that an adjustment to the value management award expense may be material to the result of operations for the quarter and the year in which the estimated vested benefit is revised 
events and trends affecting operating results 
note the market trends described below impacted both the businesses of the timber company and plum creek during 
current market conditions northern resources segment 
prices for sawtimber logs in our northern resources segment decreased in by approximately from levels 
declining prices for softwood sawtimber were partially offset by a slight improvement in prices for hardwood sawtimber 
softwood sawtimber prices  which began to decline in late  continued to weaken through the price decline was primarily due to an ample supply of logs  reduced exports of log and lumber from the us to foreign countries  principally japan  and weak lumber prices as a result of the slowing us economy 
hardwood sawtimber markets improved slightly  despite weakness in the economy  due to a tight supply of quality sawlogs 
prices for pulpwood logs in our northern resource segment declined by approximately from levels 
pulpwood prices weakened due to the worldwide overcapacity of mills that make paper products and weak pulp and paper prices 
furthermore  as a result of the continued strong us dollar  foreign imports of paper products into the us have increased while exports of us products have decreased 
southern resources segment 
prices for sawtimber logs in our southern resources segment decreased in by approximately from levels 
softwood sawtimber prices  which began to soften in the second half of  continued to weaken through the price decline was primarily due to weak commodity prices and production curtailments by lumber and plywood mills 
lumber prices declined due to the weak us economy and overcapacity in the north american lumber industry 
in addition  production of treated southern yellow pine syp lumber  which consumed approximately of lumber output in  declined in  removing approximately of the demand for syp lumber 
syp plywood mills reduced production and experienced price erosion in due to increasing competition from oriented strand board osb producers as well as general weakness in the economy 
prices for pulpwood logs in our southern resources segment decreased in by approximately from levels 
softwood pulpwood prices declined due to reduced demand from domestic and foreign pulp and paper manufacturers  lower profitability of pulpwood log converters  and an increase in the available supply of logs 
demand for softwood pulpwood declined due to pulp and paper mill closures and curtailments as a result of weak product markets 
the profitability of pulpwood converters  which include pulp and paper manufacturers  chip exporters  and osb producers  declined as the global market for pulp softened and osb production capacity outpaced growth in demand 
the supply of softwood pulpwood logs increased due to continued dry weather for much of the year  as well as a temporary influx of plantation thinning volume from private landowners associated with a government subsidy program aimed at soil conservation 
hardwood pulpwood prices increased year over year  partially offsetting the price decline in softwood pulpwood prices 
manufactured products segment 
composite indices for commodity lumber in were down from levels  primarily due to continued weakness in the us economy during  and persistent excess lumber 
table of contents capacity in north america 
lumber demand declined during  despite the increase in housing starts  primarily due to the decline in industrial production 
north american lumber capacity continues to substantially exceed lumber demand due to the new capacity installed during the prior decade 
in addition  the relative strength of the us dollar and increased offshore lumber capacity weakened the trade balance for the us lumber industry 
the preliminary findings by the international trade commission that resulted in tariffs on canadian lumber imported into the us provided some support to lumber prices for much of  effectively stemming further price deterioration 
composite prices for commodity plywood in declined from levels due to general weakness in the us economy  particularly in the industrial sector  and continued increases in competition from lower cost osb  which constrained plywood prices and displaced commodity plywood used in housing applications 
composite prices for medium density fiberboard mdf in remained flat compared to levels due to continued world wide mdf overcapacity and flat domestic consumption related to the weak us economy and the strong us dollar 
the strong us dollar impacted mdf markets by making foreign producers more competitive with us producers in domestic and overseas markets  and by encouraging furniture manufacturers who utilize mdf to source products and manufacturing in overseas locations and to target the us consumer 
harvest plans we determine our annual roundwood sawlogs and pulpwood  including stumpage sales harvesting plans based on a number of factors 
at the stand level  ranging in size from to acres  we consider the age  size  density  health and economic maturity of the timber 
a stand is a continuous block of trees of a similar age  species mix and silvicultural regime 
at the forest level  ranging in size from  to  acres  we consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of certain levels of harvesting  a forest s progression from an unmanaged to a managed forest  and the level of demand for wood within the region 
a forest is a broad administrative unit  made up of a large number of stands 
active forest management involves the conversion of a forest from an unmanaged to a managed state 
an unmanaged forest is made up largely of mature and over mature stands of timber which are growing slowly  both in terms of volume and value 
in a managed forest  there exists a range of age classes  from recently planted stands to economically mature stands 
the conversion of a forest from an unmanaged to a managed state can take from one to two forest generations  or rotations 
toward the end of the initial conversion process  a decline in the inventory volume is normal as the harvest of mature and over mature stands ends  and as the younger  faster growing stands have yet to reach final harvest age 
harvest levels in the northern resources segment were million tons during and million tons in  a increase  due to the october  merger between plum creek and the timber company 
had the merger between plum creek and the timber company occurred prior to  estimated harvest levels in the northern resources segment would have approximated million tons 
harvest levels in are expected to increase over the estimated combined harvest levels of million tons for  as softwood plantations in the pacific northwest reach maturity and harvests remain level in the northeast 
in and  we expect harvest levels to remain relatively constant at levels 
harvest levels in the southern resources segment were million tons during and million tons in  an increase  due to the october  merger between plum creek and the timber company 
had the merger between plum creek and the timber company occurred prior to  estimated harvest levels in the southern resources segment would have approximated million tons 
harvest levels in are expected to be comparable with the estimated combined harvest levels of million tons for in and  we expect harvest levels to remain relatively constant at levels 
beyond  our aggregate harvest levels will gradually increase as previously established plantations mature and become available for harvest 
actual harvest levels may vary from planned levels due to log demand  sales prices  the availability of timber from other sources  the level of real estate sales  the availability of legal 
table of contents access  abnormal weather conditions  fires and other factors that may be outside of our control 
we believe that our harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs and lumber in order to minimize the variance to planned harvest levels 
us canada softwood lumber agreement 
the trade dispute between the united states and canada continues to be a major source of uncertainty for us lumber markets 
on march   the five year lumber trade agreement between the us and canada expired 
the agreement was intended to limit the volume of lumber that was exported to the us through the assessment of a tariff on annual lumber exports in excess of certain levels from the four major lumber producing canadian provinces 
prior to this five year agreement  canadian lumber producers were aggressively increasing their penetration into the us market as a result of their lower wood fiber costs and favorable exchange rates 
soon following expiration of the trade agreement  us industry coalitions submitted anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions to the international trade commission and the us department of commerce 
it was reported that on march   the commerce department rendered its determination in favor of the industry coalitions and issued a countervailing duty on canadian lumber imports and an anti dumping duty on all non investigated canadian exporters averaging 
this rate represents the weighted average of the anti dumping rates imposed on the investigated canadian exporters 
it was also reported that the duties issued by the commerce department may not be imposed until the international trade commission renders its final injury determination  which is expected in may however  there is strong indication that the canadian government will appeal any adverse final decision to the world trade organization 
that appeal process would likely extend beyond because both the countervailing and the anti dumping duties were preliminary decisions  canadian exporters have been able to post bonds securing their obligation to pay the duties 
therefore  the duties generally did not produce the effect of significantly limiting canadian lumber imports during much of at the same time  canadian lumber imports during did not increase dramatically from import levels prior to the expiration of the trade agreement 
if the final decision by the international trade commission were to eliminate or significantly lower current import tariffs on canadian lumber before an agreement could be reached between the two countries  or if an appeal to the world trade organization were determined adversely to us interests  then an increase in the supply of lumber to us markets from canadian sources would likely result 
other factors remaining unchanged  such an increase would increase downward pressure on lumber and log prices 
comparability of financial statement periods 
we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue the acquisition of additional timberlands to increase our inventories of timber 
on october   we completed our merger with the timber company  which was accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
as a result  our ownership increased from approximately million acres to approximately million acres 
we may also sell timberlands and facilities  from time to time  if attractive opportunities arise 
accordingly  the comparability of periods covered by the company s financial statements is  and in the future may be  affected by the impact of acquisitions and divestitures

revenues increased by million due to a greater percentage of delivered log sales compared to sales of standing timber 
under a delivered log sale agreement  the seller is responsible for log and haul costs whereas the buyer incurs these costs when standing timber is sold 
while revenues are higher when the seller is responsible for the logging and hauling of timber  costs of sales generally increase by a similar amount

table of contents southern resources segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in excluding costs and expenses associated with the october  merger  costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million 
this increase of million was primarily due to an increase in log and haul costs and higher depletion expense  offset in part by lower operating expenses 
log and haul costs increased by million primarily due to a higher percentage of delivered log sales compared to sales of standing timber 
depletion expense increased by million primarily due to a refinement in the amount of future silviculture costs that are expected to be incurred to generate expected growth rates

beginning in  silviculture costs were capitalized while they were expensed in real estate segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in excluding revenues associated with the october  merger  revenues decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease of million is primarily due to the timing of real estate sales 
as a major landowner  approximately of the company s timberlands may be better suited for conservation  residential or recreational purposes rather than for long term commercial timber management 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the availability of government and not for profit funding  the general state of the economy  the plans of adjacent landowners  the company s expectation of future price appreciation and the timing of harvesting activities

manufactured products segment 
prior to the october  merger  the financial statements represent those of the timber company which did not have any manufacturing operations 
for the period october  to december  manufactured products segment revenues were million  expenses were million and operating income was million 
other segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in expenses were million during but were less than million during other costs and eliminations 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead and intercompany profit elimination decreased operating income by million in  compared to a decrease of million in this change of million was primarily due to million of intercompany profit elimination  million of merger related severance costs and higher corporate expenses due to the increase in size of the company 
at december   the deferred profit on intercompany log sales was million 
profit on intercompany log sales is deferred until the lumber and plywood manufacturing facilities convert existing log inventories into finished products and sell them to third parties 
prior to the october  merger  the timber company did not have any deferred profit on log sales 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased by million  or  to million for this increase was primarily due to the million of plum creek s debt that was acquired in connection with the october  merger

southern resources segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in this decrease of million was primarily due to a decline in harvest volume and a decline in log prices  offset in part by a higher percentage of delivered log sales 
the decline in harvest volume was due to the near completion of the accelerated conversion process and reduced purchases from georgia pacific 
during the early to mid s  the timber company increased its harvest levels in order to accelerate the conversion of its mature natural stands to more productive  faster growing plantations 
by  this conversion process was nearly completed  and as a result  harvest levels were reduced 
additionally  during georgia pacific elected to reduce its timber purchases from the timber company due to weak lumber and plywood prices 
revenues increased by million due to a greater percentage of delivered log sales compared to sales of standing timber 
under a delivered log sale agreement  the seller is responsible for log and haul costs whereas the buyer incurs these costs when standing timber is sold 
while revenues are higher when the seller is responsible for the logging and hauling of timber  costs of sales generally increase by a similar amount 
southern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for and for this decline was primarily due to lower log prices and higher operating expenses 
southern resources segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in this decrease of million was primarily due to lower depletion expense as a result of reduced harvest levels  offset in part by higher log and haul costs and higher operating expenses 
log and haul costs increased by million primarily due to a higher percentage of delivered log sales compared to sales of standing timber 
operating costs increased by million primarily due to higher silviculture expenses as a result of increased fertilization costs for to year old tree stands due to accelerated harvest levels in the early to mid s

real estate segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in excluding revenues associated with the sale of  acres of timberlands in maine   acres of timberlands in canada and its  acres of timberlands in california  revenues increased by million  or  to million 
this increase of million is primarily due to the timing of real estate sales 
as a major landowner  approximately of the company s timberlands may be better suited for conservation  residential or recreational purposes rather than for long term commercial timber management 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the availability of government and not for profit funding  the general state of the economy  the plans of adjacent landowners  the company s expectation of future price appreciation and the timing of harvesting activities 
excluding the impact of the bulk timberland sales in maine  canada and california  real estate segment operating income was of its revenues for and for real estate segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in excluding costs and expenses associated with the bulk timberland sales in maine  canada and california  costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million

on october   we consummated the merger of the timber company and plum creek 
in connection with the merger plum creek issued approximately million shares and assumed million stock options  and replaced the approximate million of georgia pacific debt that was allocated to the timber company with third party debt 
the million of debt was replaced with million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
the terms of our new debt and line of credit established in connection with the merger are as follows fixed rate debt principal amount interest rate maturity date million oct 
 million oct 
 million oct 
 million oct 
 variable rate debt the variable rate debt consists of million of bank credit facilities comprised of term facility of million  maturing on september   with interest rate based on libor plus or at december  
revolving line of credit available up to million for general corporate purposes  maturing on september   with interest rate based on libor plus which includes facility fees or at december  
interest rates for both the million term facility and the million revolving line are based on a series of borrowings with maturities that can range from one week to six months 
therefore  despite both facilities having interest rates based on libor plus  effective interest rates at december  were slightly different 
at december   we had approximately million available under our line of credit 
on january  we repaid million of borrowings under the line of credit 

table of contents at december   the aggregate maturity dates of our long term obligations consisted of the following in millions note agreements line of credit capital leases operating leases thereafter total our borrowing agreements contain various restrictive covenants  including limitations on harvest levels  sales of assets  the incurrence of indebtedness and payment of cash dividends 
our borrowing agreements restrict dividends to stockholders based on available cash  which is generally our net income after adjusting for non cash charges such as depreciation and depletion  changes in various reserves and capital expenditures and principal payments on indebtedness that are not financed 
in addition  our new line of credit requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio 
we were in compliance with all of our borrowing agreement covenants as of december  if market conditions experienced during were to persist for an extended period of time  our debt agreements would restrict our ability to maintain our current dividend level 
cash required to meet our financial needs will be significant 
we believe  however  that cash on hand and cash flows from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures  and interest and principal payments on our indebtedness for the next year 
plum creek paid a dividend of per share on november  and december  the december  dividend represents the acceleration of our fourth quarter dividend that normally would have been paid in february the february dividend was accelerated as a result of our merger with the timber company and the reit requirement under the internal revenue code that all earnings and profits inherited in connection with a merger must be distributed by january st of the year following the merger 
future dividends will be determined by our board of directors  in its sole discretion  based on consideration of a number of factors including  but not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions  tax considerations  debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on the company s ability to make cash payments  borrowing capacity  changes in the price and demand for plum creek s products and the general market for timberlands and those timberland properties that have higher and better uses 
other factors that our board of directors might consider include the appropriate timing of timber harvests  acquisition and divestiture opportunities  stock repurchases  debt repayment and other means by which the company could deliver value to its stockholders 
capital expenditures for were million  million for and million for capital expenditures for include amounts for the timber company through october  and for the merged entity for the remainder of the year 
capital expenditure amounts are net of proceeds returned from like kind exchange trusts that were not reinvested within the day required period 
during proceeds of million were returned from like kind exchange trusts 
excluding these returns  capital expenditures were million and included million for reforestation and other expenditures associated with the planting and growing of trees  million for the purchase of timberlands  and million for investments in our manufacturing facilities 
during we changed our accounting method to capitalize certain timber reforestation costs that were previously expensed 
this accounting method change increased the amount of reforestation and other expenditures associated with the planting and growing of trees that were capitalized in by million 

table of contents planned capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million and include approximately million for our timberlands  million for the development of our coalbed methane and million for our manufacturing facilities 
the timberland expenditures are primarily for reforestation and other expenditures associated with the planting and growing of trees

table of contents risk factors risk factors applicable to the business of plum creek the cyclical nature of the forest products industry could adversely affect our results of operations our results of operations are affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products industry 
prices and demand for logs and manufactured wood products are subject to cyclical fluctuations 
the demand for logs and wood products is primarily affected by the level of new residential construction activity and  to a lesser extent  repair and remodeling activity and other industrial uses 
the demand for logs is also affected by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper markets 
these activities are  in turn  subject to fluctuations due to  among other factors changes in domestic and international economic conditions  interest rates  population growth and changing demographics  and seasonal weather cycles eg  dry summers  wet winters 
decreases in the level of residential construction activity generally reduce demand for logs and wood products 
this results in lower revenues  profits and cash flows 
industry wide increases in the supply of logs and wood products during favorable price environments can also lead to downward pressure on prices 
timber companies generally increase production volumes for logs and wood products during favorable price environments 
however  such increased production  when coupled with even modest declines in demand for these products in general  could lead to oversupply and lower prices 
our results of operations may also be subject to global economic changes as global supplies of wood fiber shift in response to changing economic conditions 
changes in global economic conditions that could affect our results of operations include  but are not limited to  new timber supply sources and changes in currency exchange rates  foreign and domestic interest rates and foreign and domestic trade policies 
in addition  the market for and ability to sell non strategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses can have a significant effect on our results of operations 
market demand for timberlands generally and higher and better use timberlands may decrease and adversely affect our results of operations 
historically  canada has been a significant source of lumber for the united states market  particularly in the new home construction market 
however  in  the us and canadian governments entered into a five year lumber trade agreement that became effective april  the trade agreement was intended to limit the volume of canadian lumber exported into the us through the assessment of an export tariff on annual lumber exports to the us in excess of certain levels from the four major producing canadian provinces 
the trade agreement expired in late march  and soon thereafter us industry coalitions submitted anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions to the international trade commission and the us department of commerce 
it was reported that on march   the commerce department rendered its determination in favor of the industry coalitions and issued a countervailing duty on canadian lumber imports and an anti dumping duty on all non investigated canadian exporters averaging 
it was also reported that the duties issued by the commerce department may not be imposed until the international trade commission renders its final injury determination  which is expected in may however  there is strong indication that the canadian government will appeal any adverse final decision to the world trade organization  a process which could extend beyond if the final decision by the international trade commission results in significantly lower import tariffs on canadian lumber before an agreement can be reached between the two countries  or if an appeal to the world 
table of contents trade organization were determined adversely to us interests  then an increase in the supply of lumber to us markets from canadian sources would likely result 
other factors remaining unchanged  such an increase would increase downward pressure on lumber and log prices 
the forest products industry is highly competitive the forest products industry is highly competitive in terms of price and quality 
wood products are subject to increasing competition from a variety of substitute products  including non wood and engineered wood products 
for example  plywood markets are subject to competition from oriented strand board  and us lumber and log markets are subject to competition from other worldwide suppliers 
our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate on july   we converted from a master limited partnership to a real estate investment trust  or reit 
reits are required to distribute of their net taxable ordinary income 
however  unlike ordinary income such as rent  the internal revenue code of  as amended  does not require reits to distribute capital gain income 
accordingly  we do not believe that the internal revenue code will require us to distribute any material amounts of cash given that the majority of our income comes from timber sales  which are treated as capital gains 
our board of directors  in its sole discretion  determines the amount of the quarterly dividends to be provided to our stockholders based on consideration of a number of factors including  but not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions  tax considerations  borrowing capacity and other factors  including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments  future acquisitions and divestitures  harvest levels  changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands and those timberland properties that have higher and better uses 
consequently  our dividend levels may fluctuate 
we were required by january   to distribute the earnings and profits acquired from the subsidiaries 
we believe that the accelerated payment of our fourth quarter dividend for  which we paid on december   was sufficient to distribute the subsidiaries earnings and profits 
if we failed to distribute an amount equal to the subsidiaries earnings and profits  we might be subject to adverse tax consequences 
we expect that  even if the earnings and profits of the subsidiaries were subsequently adjusted upward by the internal revenue service  the amount we distributed exceeds such earnings and profits 
nevertheless  such an adjustment may give rise to the imposition of the excise tax on the excess income required to be distributed over the amounts treated as distributed after application of the earnings and profits rule 
our ability to harvest timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our operations weather conditions  timber growth cycles  access limitations and regulatory requirements associated with the protection of wildlife and water resources may restrict harvesting of timberlands as may other factors  including damage by fire  insect infestation  disease  prolonged drought and other natural disasters 
although damage from such natural causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of the timber  there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be so limited 
as is common in the forest products industry  we do not maintain insurance coverage with respect to damage to our timberlands 
much of our northwest timberlands are intermingled with sections of federal land managed by the united states forest service 
in many cases  access is only  or most economically  achieved through a road or roads built across adjacent federal land 
in order to access these intermingled timberlands  we have obtained from time to time either temporary or permanent access rights across federal lands 
this process has often been  and will likely continue to be  affected by  among other things  the requirements of the endangered species act  the national environmental policy act and the clean water act 
access and regulatory restrictions may delay or prevent us from harvesting some of our timberlands 

table of contents our revenues  net income and cash flow from our operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels 
in addition  the terms of our long term debt agreements and lines of credit limit our ability to fund dividends to stockholders by accelerating the harvest of significant amounts of timber 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may prevent a change in control some provisions of our certificate of incorporation may discourage a third party from seeking to gain control of us 
for example  the ownership limitations described in our certificate of incorporation could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or limiting a change of control in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price 
the following is a summary of provisions of our certificate of incorporation which may have this effect 
the ownership limit 
in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit  not more than of the value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals  as defined in the internal revenue code 
for the purpose of preserving our reit qualification  our certificate of incorporation prohibits ownership  either directly or under the applicable attribution rules of the internal revenue code  of more than of the lesser of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding or the value of the outstanding shares of our common stock by any stockholder other than by some designated persons agreed to by us or as set forth in our certificate of incorporation the ownership limit 
the ownership limit may have the effect of discouraging an acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors 
the ownership limit in our certificate of incorporation also restricts the transfer of our common stock 
for example  any transfer of our equity is null and void if the transfer would result in any person owning  directly or indirectly  equity in excess of the ownership limit  result in our equity being owned  directly or indirectly  by fewer than persons  result in us being closely held as defined in the internal revenue code  result in us failing to qualify as a domestically controlled reit as defined in the internal revenue code  or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 
the preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to million shares of preferred stock 
upon issuance  our board of directors will establish the preferences and rights for this preferred stock 
these preferences and rights may include the right to elect additional directors 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us even if a change in control were in our stockholders best interests 
section of the delaware general corporation law 
section of the delaware general corporation law generally prohibits us from engaging in business transactions with a person or entity that owns or more of our voting stock for a period of three years following the time such person or entity became an interested stockholder unless  prior to such time  our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in such person or entity becoming an interested stockholder 
a business transaction may include mergers  asset sales and other transactions resulting in financial benefit to the person or entity that owns or more of our voting stock 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would be subject to tax at corporate rates and would not be able to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income if in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates of approximately  
table of contents we would not be allowed to deduct dividends to stockholders in computing our taxable income  and unless we were entitled to relief under the internal revenue code  we would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we might need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the additional tax liability 
accordingly  funds available for investment or dividends to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the years involved 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions 
although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules  there cannot be any assurance that we are or will remain so qualified 
in addition  the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the united states department of the treasury 
changes to the tax law could adversely affect our stockholders 
we cannot predict with certainty whether  when  in what forms  or with what effective dates  the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders may be changed 
our timberlands are subject to federal and state environmental regulations we are subject to regulation under  among other laws  the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  the national environmental policy act  and the endangered species act  as well as similar state laws and regulations 
violations of various statutory and regulatory programs that apply to our operations could result in civil penalties  remediation expenses  potential injunctions  cease and desist orders and criminal penalties 
we engage in the following activities which are subject to regulation forestry activities  including harvesting  planting and road building  use and maintenance  the generation of air emissions  the discharge of industrial wastewater and storm water  and the generation and disposal of both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent in recent years and could become more stringent in the future 
some environmental statutes impose strict liability  rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to the person s negligence or fault 
these laws or future legislation or administrative or judicial action with respect to protection of the environment may adversely affect our business 
the endangered species act and similar state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction 
a number of species on our timberlands have been and in the future may be protected under these laws  including the northern spotted owl  marbled murrelet  gray wolf  grizzly bear  mountain caribou  bald eagle  karner blue butterfly  red cockaded woodpecker  bull trout  and various salmon species 
protection of threatened and endangered species may include restrictions on timber harvesting  road building and other forest practices on private  federal and state land containing the affected species 
matters pertaining to arthur andersen arthur andersen served as the independent certified public accountant for the timber company prior to the timber company s october  merger with plum creek 
because the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition  the historical financial statements of the timber company are now the historical financial 
table of contents statements of plum creek 
although plum creek did not engage arthur andersen as its certified public accountant following the merger  plum creek s periodic financial statements filed with the sec include the timber company s historical financial statements  which were audited by arthur andersen 
on march   arthur andersen was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the government s investigation of enron 
arthur andersen has indicated that it intends to contest vigorously the indictment 
the sec has said that it will continue accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen so long as arthur andersen is able to make certain representations to its clients 
plum creek s access to the capital markets and its ability to make timely sec filings could be impaired if the sec ceases accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen or if arthur andersen becomes unable to make the required representations to plum creek 
in either case  plum creek would take such actions  if any  as may be necessary or advisable to enable plum creek to maintain access to the capital markets and timely financial reporting 
tax risk factors if georgia pacific s redemption of timber company common stock did not qualify for tax free treatment  georgia pacific and the former holders of timber company common stock would be subject to tax we and georgia pacific have received opinions from our respective tax counsel that the redemption by georgia pacific of each outstanding share of georgia pacific corporation timber group common stock  or timber company stock  in exchange for a unit  which represented one outstanding share of common stock of each of the former subsidiaries of georgia pacific which collectively held all of the assets and liabilities attributed to the timber company  and the mergers will generally be treated as tax free transactions for federal income tax purposes  that is that the redemptions will be eligible for treatment under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in rendering their respective tax opinions  tax counsel noted that the redemption presents novel factual and legal issues and that the conclusions in their opinions depend heavily on representations from our officers and those of georgia pacific 
in addition  we and georgia pacific sought a ruling from the internal revenue service with respect to the treatment of the redemption as a tax free exchange under section of the internal revenue code 
the internal revenue service exercised its discretion not to issue the ruling on the basis that the evidence proffered in support of the business purposes for the redemption and the mergers did not meet the high standard that the published procedures of the internal revenue service require taxpayers to satisfy in order to receive favorable rulings 
it is not possible to predict whether the efforts of the parties to obtain a ruling will cause the redemption to be subject to greater scrutiny or challenge by the internal revenue service 
although tax counsel have issued their respective tax opinions  such opinions are not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts and no assurance can be given that the internal revenue service would not challenge the transactions and that  if the internal revenue service did so  it would not be upheld by a court 
if  for any reason  the redemption were not eligible for treatment under section of the internal revenue code  georgia pacific would recognize taxable gain on the redemption in an amount approximately equal to the value of the subsidiaries at the time of the redemption 
under the tax matters agreement between us and georgia pacific  we would generally be responsible for of such liability  in excess of the proceeds of the insurance policies obtained by the timber company  which are discussed below 
assuming that the price of our common stock on october  was the correct measure of the fair market value of the subsidiaries  and assuming that georgia pacific had little or no tax basis in the stock of the subsidiaries  the federal income tax liability would be approximately billion  excluding interest and any penalties 
the insurance will not cover all circumstances under which the separation of the timber company and redemption of timber company common stock could become taxable to georgia pacific and will not cover all of the potential tax liability the timber company obtained insurance from a number of major insurance companies for a total of million against the risk that georgia pacific would be subject to tax on the redemption 
the insurance generally 
table of contents only covers the risk that the legal analysis of the redemption is not accepted by the internal revenue service or the courts 
if  for example  the redemption was subject to tax because our representations or those of georgia pacific were untrue or incorrect  georgia pacific would likely not be able to collect under the terms of the insurance 
the insurance does not cover any tax liability of a former holder of timber company common stock either from the redemption or the mergers 
in addition  subject to specified exceptions  neither we nor georgia pacific may settle a claim relating to an insured tax loss without the consent of the insurers 
we will have to abide by potentially significant restrictions with respect to issuances of our equity securities until october even if the redemption otherwise qualifies for tax free treatment under section of the internal revenue code  georgia pacific may  nevertheless  be subject to tax under section e of the internal revenue code if acquisitions or issuances of our stock following the merger cause the former holders of timber company common stock to own less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
in particular  section e of the internal revenue code will apply if such issuances or acquisitions occur as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the redemption 
for this purpose  any acquisitions or issuances of our stock before october are presumed to be part of such a plan  although we and georgia pacific may be able to rebut that presumption 
if such an issuance or acquisition of our stock triggers the application of section e of the internal revenue code  georgia pacific would recognize taxable gain on the redemption  but the redemption would generally be tax free to each of the former holders of timber company common stock 
under the tax matters agreement between us and georgia pacific  we would be required to indemnify georgia pacific against that taxable gain if it were triggered by an acquisition or issuance of our stock 
as of the effective date of the merger  the former holders of timber company common stock held approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis 
because of the change in control limitation imposed by section e of the internal revenue code  we may be limited in the amount of stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital until october also  our indemnity obligation to georgia pacific might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk approximately billion of the long term debt of the company bears interest at fixed rates  and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
the following table presents principal cash flows in millions based upon maturity dates of the debt obligations and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed rate debt

at december   the timber company s debt was an allocated portion of georgia pacific s outstanding debt and  therefore  the fair value of the allocated debt was not impacted by changes in market interest rates 
the interest charged on the allocated debt was adjusted quarterly based on the weighted average interest rate of georgia pacific s debt
