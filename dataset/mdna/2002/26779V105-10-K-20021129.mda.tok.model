the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes these accounting policies involve judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 
management believes it has exercised proper judgment in determining these estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to its management at the time the estimates were made 
the significant accounting policies are described in the company s financial statements see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
of these policies  management believes the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy is significant because it is the primary component of its results of operations 
the company follows specific and detailed policies on recognizing revenue 
revenue from patient services are recognized as performed based on net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors  and others for services rendered under reimbursement agreements 
allowances for discounts on services or adjustments for non covered costs and expenses are recognized in the period in which the related revenues are provided 
accounts receivable and allowances for doubtful accounts as explained under revenue recognition the company records revenue and related accounts receivable based on net realizable amounts from the patients  third party payors  and others for services rendered under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
as with any healthcare provider  some of the accounts receivable will ultimately prove uncollectible  primarily due to the inability of patients to satisfy their financial obligations to the company 
allowances for doubtful accounts are determined by the company s management based on historical experience and an assessment of the circumstances applicable to individual accounts

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal year and for purchase business combinations consummated after june  these standards change the accounting for business combinations by  among other things  eliminating pooling of interests accounting and requiring a change in the method of expensing goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life will be subject to an annual review for impairment rather than periodic amortization 
finite lived intangibles will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
during  the company will evaluate existing goodwill and intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations completed prior to july  the carrying amount of recognized intangible assets that meet the criteria for recognition apart from goodwill or any identifiable intangible assets that have been presented with goodwill and other intangible assets for financial reporting purposes will be reclassified and reported separately from goodwill 
the unamortized balance of any negative goodwill will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company will also test goodwill for impairment during  using the two step process prescribed in sfas no

the company does not believe the effect of these tests will have a material impact on the earnings and financial position of the company 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 impairment of long lived assets  sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
retains the requirements of sfas no 
to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
removes goodwill from its scope 
sfas no 
is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have any material impact on the financial position of the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates as well as credit risk concentrations 
all of the company s contracts are denominated in us and  therefore  the company has no foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
this exposure relates to the company s reducing revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of august  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on the dealer commercial paper rate plus 
as no borrowings have been made against the credit facility  an interest rate change would not have any current impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are invested in money market accounts 
accordingly  the company is subject to changes in market interest rates 
however  the company does not believe a change in these rates would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
there is an inherent roll over risk on these funds as they accrue interest at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable due to the variability of future interest rates 
credit risks the company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables from various private insurers 
the company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses  but does not require collateral from these parties
