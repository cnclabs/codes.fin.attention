home closings declined from  in fiscal to in fiscal  including and homes  respectively  closed in unconsolidated joint ventures 
the average home sales price increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in total unit closings was due primarily to a reduction in actively selling projects between periods  the company s exit from the nevada market and an unusual level of lot closings in fiscal the increase in average sales price is due to the closing of a higher number of units in the higher priced california market in fiscal the decrease in the company s backlog from units at february  to units at february  is also primarily due to a decrease in selling projects in certain of the company s markets and to a lesser extent  the reduction in backlog units in nevada in connection with the company s exit from that market 
the number of actively selling projects not including the managed projects has decreased from at february  to at february   which affected both backlog and net new orders

substantially all interest costs are initially capitalized to real estate projects and are recognized as interest expense as homes and land are sold 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the effective tax rate was reduced from the statutory rate in fiscal due to the impact of amortizing negative goodwill  and in fiscal primarily through the reversal of the company s previously established valuation allowance

home closings declined slightly from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  including and homes  respectively  closed in unconsolidated joint ventures 
the average home sales price increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in total unit closings was due primarily to increased activity in the company s colorado market and to a few significant lot sales 
the increase in average sales price was due to the closing of a higher number of units in the higher priced california market in fiscal the company s actual gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  due to a change in the mix of closings to certain higher margin projects 
the gross margin including unconsolidated joint ventures increased from in fiscal to in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense remained stable at in both fiscal and fiscal selling  general and administrative expense of million for fiscal increased million or as compared to fiscal due to a higher level of sales activity 
income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased from million fiscal to a loss of  in fiscal  due to the establishment of certain reserves in connection with the wind down of some of the older joint ventures  as well as the fact that the profits from the newer joint ventures were being allocated primarily to cover preferred return on partner s capital during fiscal interest and other income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and consists primarily of the results of operations of the company s mortgage broker operations  as well as certain financing and other transactions 
minority interest of million in fiscal and million in fiscal primarily represents the share of income from cph llc and cph newport coast  llc attributable to chf 
interest incurred was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  while interest expensed was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal substantially all interest costs are initially capitalized to real estate projects and are recognized as interest expense as homes and land are sold 
as presented in the consolidated statements of operations  income from unconsolidated joint ventures for fiscal excludes the recognition of approximately  in interest previously capitalized to the lots contributed to mpe 
such interest costs are included in interest expense 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the effective tax rate in both years was reduced from the statutory rate by the use of available loss carryforwards 
such loss carryforwards have now been substantially fully utilized 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal cash requirements are for the acquisition  development  construction  marketing and overhead of its projects 
when building inventory  the company uses substantial amounts of cash that are generally obtained from borrowings  available cash flow from operations and partners contributions to joint ventures 
at the current time  all material financing transactions and arrangements are incurred either by cph llc or by certain project specific entities 
during the third quarter of fiscal  cph llc entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility the senior facility with several participant banks 
the facility has a maximum commitment of million and a two year revolving term 
proceeds from this facility were used to pay down cph llc s existing facilities and retire the remaining senior notes during the quarter 
table of contents ending november   as discussed below 
the new credit facility has substantially more favorable pricing than the senior notes which have been retired 
as of february   the company has in place several credit facilities  including the senior facility  totaling million the facilities with various bank lenders the banks  of which approximately million was outstanding 
the facilities other than the senior facility are secured by liens on various completed or under construction homes and lots held by cph llc  cph newport coast  llc and cph yucaipa i  llc  all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries 
pursuant to the facilities  the company and the wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to certain covenants  which require  among other things  the maintenance of a consolidated liabilities to net worth ratio  minimum liquidity  minimum net worth and loss limitations  all as defined in the documents that evidence the facilities 
at february   the company and the wholly owned subsidiaries were in compliance with these covenants 
the facilities also define certain events that constitute events of default 
as of february   no such event had occurred 
commitment fees are payable annually on some of the facilities 
homebuilding activity is being financed out of cph llc cash  bank financing  and the existing joint ventures  including joint ventures with institutional investors 
in addition  development work undertaken in certain of the company s joint ventures is financed through various non recourse lending arrangements 
the company anticipates that it will continue to utilize both third party financing and joint ventures to cover financing needs in excess of internally generated cash flow 
management expects that cash flow generated from operations and from bank financing will be sufficient to cover the debt service and to fund cph llc s current development and homebuilding activities for the reasonably foreseeable future  and expects that capital commitments from its joint venture partners and other bank facilities will provide sufficient financing for the operation of its joint ventures 
interest rates and inflation the long term impact of inflation on the company is manifested in increased land prices  land development  construction and overhead costs balanced by increased sales prices 
the company generally contracts for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin and  accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes  land and other real estate properties may affect the company s profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time of sale and the company generally sells its homes prior to commencement of construction  any inflation of construction costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
the company generally attempts to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
housing demand  in general  is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as materials and other costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest costs 
if the company is unable to duplicate its past ability to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance a home purchase  the company s homebuilding revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford a new home 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those which impact its most critical accounting policies on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  within the framework of current accounting literature 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or 
table of contents conditions 
management believes that the following accounting policies are among the most important to accurately report the company s financial condition and results of operations and require among the most subjective or complicated judgments  which are subject to uncertainty and the potential for change in subsequent accounting periods revenue recognition  real estate projects and cost of sales a sale is recorded and profit is recognized when a sale is consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investments are adequate  any receivables are not subject to future subordination  and the usual risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
when it is determined that the earnings process is not complete  profit is deferred for recognition in future periods 
examples of such circumstances would be if the company sells and leases back a model home  or if the company takes a buyer s home in trade 
the profit recorded by the company is based on the calculation of cost of sales which is dependent on the company s allocation of costs  including a provision for estimated future warranty costs  as discussed below 
real estate projects are carried at cost  net of impairment losses  if any 
real estate projects consist primarily of raw land  lots under development  houses under construction and completed houses 
all direct and indirect land costs  offsite and onsite improvements and applicable interest and other carrying charges are capitalized to real estate projects during periods when the project is under development 
land  offsite costs and all other common costs  including projected indirect construction costs and carrying costs  are typically allocated to lots benefited within a project based upon relative sales values before construction 
onsite direct construction costs are allocated to the individual homes based upon the relative sales value of the homes 
the estimation process involved in determining relative sales values is inherently uncertain because it involves estimates of current market values for land parcels before construction as well as future sales values of individual homes 
the company s estimates of future sales values are supported by the company s budgeting process 
any estimate of future sales values is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of current market conditions as well as future market events and conditions 
the impact of applying the relative sales value method can be significant in the case where certain lots in a project are expected to command high premiums for views  lot size or other desirable attributes  in comparison with other lots within the same project 
additionally  in determining the allocation of costs to a particular land parcel or individual home  the company relies on project budgets that are based on a variety of assumptions  including assumptions about construction schedules and future costs to be incurred 
it is possible that actual results could differ from budgeted amounts for various reasons  including construction delays  increases in costs which have not yet been committed  or unforeseen issues encountered during construction that fall outside the scope of contracts obtained 
while the actual results for a particular construction project are accurately reported over time  a variance between the budget and actual costs could result in the understatement or overstatement of costs and a related impact on gross margins in a specific reporting period 
to reduce the potential for such distortion  the company has set forth procedures which have been applied by the company on a consistent basis  including assessing and revising project budgets on a monthly basis  obtaining  where possible  commitments from subcontractors and vendors for future costs to be incurred  reviewing the adequacy of warranty accruals and historical warranty claims experience  and utilizing the most recent information available to estimate costs 
management believes that the company s policies provide for reasonably dependable estimates to be used in the calculation and reporting of costs 
the company relieves its accumulated real estate projects through cost of sales and interest expense for the cost of homes sold 
impairment of real estate projects sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires impairment losses to be recorded on assets to be held and used by the company when indicators of impairments are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of assets 
the estimation process used in determining the undiscounted cash flows of the assets is inherently uncertain because it involves estimates of future revenues 
table of contents and costs 
as described more fully above  estimates of revenues and costs are supported by the company s budgeting process 
when an impairment loss is required for assets to be held and used by the company  the related assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value 
management reviews all real estate projects for impairment on an ongoing basis 
fair value represents the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than a forced or liquidation sale 
the estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of fair value is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of current market yields as well as future events and conditions 
such future events and conditions include economic and market conditions  as well as the availability of suitable financing to fund development and construction activities 
the realization of the company s real estate projects is dependent upon future uncertain events and conditions and  accordingly  the actual timing and amounts realized by the company may be materially different from their estimated fair values 
joint ventures the company has historically entered into joint ventures with financial partners in which the joint venture partner typically provides the majority of the capital and or financing required for the project 
the company has utilized joint ventures in order to increase the ability of the company to control real property and to diversify the company s sources of financing 
the company expects to continue to utilize joint ventures in the future on a selective basis  taking into account other available sources of financing  project risk and the potential return to the company 
at the current time  the company s typical investment in most of its joint ventures consists of a percentage of the total capital required typically ten percent or less and after substantial completion of the project and after payment of all project expenses  return of invested capital together with a preferred return the company participates in the profits of the project 
the company typically does not provide any financial or other credit enhancements in connection with these joint venture investments but sometimes provides operational agreements that it will complete construction 
the company accounts for these joint ventures on the equity method when the company s ownership is less than percent  and on a consolidated basis when the company s ownership exceeds percent 
management fees in connection with the joint ventures discussed above  the company typically charges a management fee to the joint venture  representing reimbursement for overhead expenditures made by the company on behalf of the joint venture project 
these fees are typically based on a percentage of revenue within the joint venture and are collected over the life of the project 
this reimbursement is included in the company s income statement as an offset to selling  general and administrative expense and is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for unconsolidated joint ventures and managed projects  such amounts are recognized currently  and for consolidated joint ventures and subsidiaries  a portion of the fee related to homes which have not closed is deferred 
related party transactions the company has in place formal systems to identify  track and report related party transactions 
the company feels that all significant related party transactions have been properly accounted for and adequately disclosed

sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
this pronouncement addresses  among other things  how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be assessed at least annually for impairment using a fair value methodology 
the company will adopt this statement for all goodwill and other intangible assets acquired after june  and for all existing goodwill and other intangible assets beginning march  upon adoption of this standard on march   the company is required to accrete the remaining balance of negative goodwill through a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  which will increase net income in fiscal by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
other than the accretion of the remaining negative goodwill  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas no 
 which is discussed above  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no

the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   with early application encouraged and generally are to be applied prospectively 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its debt 
under the new credit facility  the company utilized interest rate swaps in order to fix the interest rate on million of its variable rate debt 
the company has not used forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analysis is to provide a framework to understand the company s sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of february  many of the statements contained in this section are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading forward looking statements 
the company uses debt financing primarily for the purpose of acquiring and developing land and constructing and selling homes 
historically  the company has made short term borrowings under its revolving credit facilities to fund these expenditures 
in addition  the company has previously issued million in fixed rate debt to provide longer term financing 
during fiscal  the company repurchased the remaining balance of senior notes 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not the company s earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value of the debt instrument  but do affect the company s future earnings and cash flows 
the company does not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until the company would be required to refinance such debt 
based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at february   and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest incurred for the coming year of approximately  including the impact of the interest rate swaps and discussed above 
the table below details the principal amount and the average interest rates for debt for each category based upon the expected maturity dates
