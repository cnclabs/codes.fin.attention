over the past three years the company has opened seven new stores and relocated two 
the company currently plans to open at least two stores during the next months  of which one will be in riverside  california and the second will be the company s second store in the las vegas  nevada market 
future store openings are subject to availability of satisfactory store locations based on local competitive conditions  site availability and cost and the company s ability to provide and maintain high service levels and quality brand merchandising at competitive prices 
store openings are expected to have a favorable impact on sales volume  but will negatively affect profit in the short term 
new stores tend to have higher costs in the early years of operation  due primarily to extra labor used to open new stores  reduced sales on a per employee basis until the store matures and increased promotional costs 
as the store matures  sales tend to level off and expenses decline as a percentage of sales 
the company s stores generally require three years to attract a stable  mature customer base 
the company estimates the cost of opening an average new store to be approximately million consisting primarily of the investment in inventory net of average vendor payables  the cost of furniture  fixtures and equipment and pre opening expenses  such as the costs associated with training employees and stocking the store 
opening costs for each new store can vary significantly depending on the amount of negotiated landlord contribution to the company s required improvements 
the company s sales are dependent to some degree on the economic environment and level of consumer spending in southern california and nevada 
the retail industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation  and a recession in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits have had  and may in the future have  a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations

table of contents the market for retail sporting goods is seasonal in nature 
the company s highest sales levels and operating profit occur predominantly during the winter months of november  december and january  which overlap the third and fourth fiscal quarters ended december and march as with other retailers  the company s business is heavily affected by sales of merchandise during the holiday season 
in addition  the company s product mix has historically emphasized cold weather sporting goods merchandise  particularly ski related products  thus boosting sales levels during the winter months and often increasing the seasonality of the company s business 
sales of winter related products ranged from to of the company s net sales in recent years 
in each of fiscal  and   and  respectively  of the company s sales were attributable to the months of november  december and january 
management anticipates that this seasonal trend in sales will continue 
no assurance can be provided that any substantial decrease in sales for the winter months  which could be influenced by the amount and timing of snowfall at the resorts frequented by those living in southern california  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability 
however  in order to be less dependent upon winter business  management continues to emphasize a broadened product mix that offers merchandise generally purchased by consumers in the spring  summer and fall seasons 
marketing campaigns are conveyed through newspaper  radio  magazine  direct mail and billboards 
magazine and billboards are funded primarily by marketing funds collected from the company s vendors 
through the team sales division the company reaches out to communities in which its stores do business contributing to local teams and leagues 
the company operates a  square foot distribution center in ontario  california that serves as the primary receiving  distribution and warehousing facility 
common carriers are used to deliver merchandise to the nevada store and the company s trucks deliver merchandise from the distribution center to the southern california stores 
a minimal amount of merchandise is shipped directly by vendors to the stores 
most of the product received at the distribution center is processed by unpacking and verifying the contents received and then sorting the contents by store for delivery 
some of the product received at the distribution center is pre packaged and pre ticketed by the vendor so it can be immediately cross docked to trucks bound for the stores 
due to the efficiencies cross docking creates  the company encourages its vendors to pre package and ticket their products to increase the percentage of merchandise that is cross docked 
some of the merchandise is held at the distribution center for future allocation to the stores based on current sales trends as directed by our replenishment system to optimize inventory levels 
the company uses a best of breed approach to information systems 
all new systems communicate with a legacy system that has become the centralized data repository and the primary financial system 
consistent with the stated direction to upgrade the legacy systems  those applications were migrated to a new sun computer in may and an oracle database was successfully implemented 
with those enhancements in place  the foundation has been established for future developments on the oracle platform 
in october store systems were upgraded to the encore retail suite of applications from crs retail systems  an open technology allowing flexibility for the future 
a custom rental program was added to the store system in october merchandise replenishment is controlled by e software from the jda software group  inc running on an ibm as future projects include upgrading credit debit authorization processing in the fall of  a warehouse management system expected to be installed in the spring of  continual on going enhancements to the legacy system  and edi software from sps commerce  among other projects 
the company uses the sport chalet name as a service mark in connection with its business operations 
the company has registered sport chalet as a service mark with the state of california  and has obtained federal registration for certain purposes  which has been successfully defended in the past against attack by third parties 
the company also retains common law rights to the name  which it has used since the lack of federal registration for certain purposes might pose a problem if the company were to expand into a geographic area where the name or any confusingly similar name is used by someone with prior rights

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s primary capital requirements are for inventory and store expansion  relocation and remodeling 
historically  cash from operations  credit terms from vendors and bank borrowing have met the company s liquidity needs 
the company believes that these sources will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  was primarily the result of net income  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  and increases in bank overdraft combined with accounts payable offset by inventory purchases 
inventory levels from year to year typically increase due to the addition of new stores 
in fiscal and  the addition of three stores in each year increased inventories million and million  respectively  while in fiscal the inventory increase of million was a result of a significant increase in comparable store sales along with the purchase of john wells golf shops and the addition of one new store 
the company evaluates its inventory on a per store basis 
the average inventory per store was million in fiscal and and million in fiscal bank overdraft represents the total of checks in transit in excess of cash on hand 
for fiscal  invested cash built up in prior years was used to fund the company s expansion plan

accounts payable historically increases as inventory increases 
for fiscal  accounts payable combined with the bank overdraft increased by million primarily due to increased inventory 
during fiscal  accounts payable increased only  as part of the inventory increase occurred early in the year due to a new store and the purchase of john wells golf shops and vendors were paid before year end

as a result of the company s ongoing growth and strategic initiatives  forecasted capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million 
approximately million of this amount will be used to open two new stores  and  is planned for a new corporate office 
in addition  approximate expenditures on existing store improvements and information technology are million and million  respectively 
in june  the company amended its credit facility with bank of america national trust and savings association  inc the lender which  as modified  provides for advances up to million  increasing to million for the period october  through december   less the amount of any outstanding draws up to a million maximum in authorized letters of credit 
interest accrues at the bank s prime rate plus or can be fixed for a period of time at the then current rate established under one of several indices  all at the company s option 
this credit facility expires on september  and the company expects to renegotiate and extend the term of this agreement or obtain another form of financing before that date 

table of contents the company s obligation to the lender is presently secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the company s non real estate assets  and the company is subject to several restrictive covenants 
the principal operating covenants require the company to maintain certain minimum cash flow coverage and debt to equity ratios and restrict the level of capital expenditures  calculated on a quarterly basis 
the company currently is in compliance with the amended covenants and expects to remain in compliance with the amended covenants during the term of the credit facility 
the company believes its credit line with the lender is sufficient to fund capital expenditures for the foreseeable future and to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements 
however  unexpected conditions could cause the company to request additional borrowing capacity from the lender or alter its expansion plans or operations 
the company s primary contractual obligations and commitments are its store leases with initial terms expiring from through and typically provide for multiple five year renewal options payments due by period operating leases within year years years after years total all retail store leases provide for base rent which may or may not be credited against percentage rent based upon gross sales from the premises 
in some of the leases  base rental amounts increase as the lease term progresses  although in some cases  the company expects that percentage rent will more than offset the base rental amounts

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the financial statements  the company is required to make estimates and judgments which affect the results of its operations and the reported value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes that the following summarizes critical accounting policies which require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out determined by the retail method of accounting or market 
the company considers cost to include direct cost of merchandise  plus internal costs associated with merchandise procurement  storage and handling 
the company regularly reviews aged and excess inventories to determine if the carrying value of such inventories exceeds market value  a reserve is recorded to reduce the carrying value to market value as necessary 
a determination of market value requires estimates and judgment based on the company s historical markdown experience and anticipated markdowns based on future merchandising and advertising plans  seasonal considerations  expected business trends and other factors 

table of contents seasonality as noted previously  the months of november  december and january historically have accounted for the largest percentage of the company s net sales and a significant portion of its net income 
as is typical with other sporting goods retailers  the company s sales volume increases significantly during the holiday season and the peak ski and snowboard season generally corresponds to this three month period 
the company s operating results historically have been influenced by the amount and timing of snowfall at the resorts frequented by those living in southern california 
an early snowfall often has influenced sales because it generally extends the demand for winter apparel and equipment while a late snowfall may have the opposite effect 
the third and fourth quarters of fiscal experienced weaker than expected sales of winter related products as a result of warm winter weather conditions that provided snowfall well below average 
sales of winter related products ranged from to of the total company s net sales in recent years 
in each of fiscal  and   and  respectively  of the company s sales were attributable to the months of november  december and january 
suppliers in the ski and snowboard industry require that commitments be made for purchases of apparel and equipment by april for fall delivery  and only limited quantities of merchandise can be reordered during the fall 
consequently  the company places its orders in the spring anticipating snowfall in the winter 
if the snowfall does not at least provide an adequate base or occurs late in the season  or if sales do not meet projections  the company may be required to mark down its winter apparel and equipment 
factors that may affect future results the statements which are not historical facts contained in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  that involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those set forth below 
economic conditions 
the retail industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation  and a recession in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits have had  and may in the future have  a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
competition 
the sporting goods business and the retail environment are highly competitive  and the company competes with national  regional and local full line sporting goods chains  specialty stores  supplier owned stores  discount and department stores  and e tailers 
a number of the company s competitors are larger and have greater resources than the company 
regional market concentration 
currently  all of the company s stores are located in southern california and the las vegas area of nevada 
accordingly  the company is subject to regional risks  such as the economy  weather conditions  natural disasters and government regulations 
if the region were to suffer an economic downturn or if other adverse events were to occur  there could be an adverse effect on the company s net sales and profitability and its ability to implement its planned growth 
several of the company s competitors operate stores across the united states and  thus  are not as vulnerable as the company to such regional risks 

table of contents single distribution center 
the company has a single distribution center and if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at the facility  merchandise may be lost or undeliverable to our stores  thereby  reducing sales and profitability 
expansion plan 
the company s continued growth is dependent to a significant degree upon its ability to open new stores on a profitable basis 
the company s ability to expand will depend  in part  on business conditions and the availability of satisfactory store locations based on local competitive conditions  site availability and cost  and the company s ability to provide and maintain high service levels and quality brand merchandising at competitive prices 
in addition  a decline in the company s overall financial performance  increased rents or any other adverse effects arising from the commercial real estate market in the company s markets may adversely effect the company s current growth plan 
there can be no assurance that the company will possess sufficient funds to finance the expenditures related to its planned growth  that new stores can be opened on a timely basis  that such new stores can be operated on a profitable basis  or that such growth will be manageable 
future capital requirements 
the company may not be able to fund its future growth or react to competitive pressures if it lacks sufficient funds 
unexpected conditions could cause the company to be in violation of its lender s operating covenants 
currently  the company feels it has sufficient cash available through its bank credit facilities and cash from operations to fund existing operations for the foreseeable future 
the company cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in the future if necessary 
management of growth 
since its inception  the company has experienced periods of rapid growth 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in maintaining or increasing its sales in the future 
any future growth in sales will require additional working capital and may place a significant strain on the company s management  management information systems  inventory management  distribution facilities and receivables management 
any failure to timely enhance the company s operating systems  or unexpected difficulties in implementing such enhancements  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company depends on the continued service of its senior management 
the loss of the services of any key employee could hurt the business 
also  the future success of the company depends on its ability to identify  attract  hire  train and motivate other highly skilled personnel 
failure to do so may adversely affect future results 
seasonality 
the company s business is seasonal in nature 
as a result  the company s results of operations are likely to vary during its fiscal year 
see seasonality variability of quarterly results 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  a substantial variation in its net sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company believes that the factors which influence this variability of quarterly results include general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending  changing consumer demands  the timing of the company s introduction of new products  the level of consumer acceptance of each new product  the seasonality of the markets in which the company participates  the weather and actions of competitors 
accordingly  a comparison of the company s results of operations from period to period is not necessarily meaningful  and the company s results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
closely controlled stock 
at june   norbert olberz  the company s founder and chairman of the board of directors  owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
mr
