on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
the january  transition adjustment prescribed by sfas no 
was not material to the company s consolidated financial position or its results of operations 
as a result of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
 hedged residential real estate loans held for sale  commitments to 
table of contents originate loans for sale  and commitments to sell loans are now generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value  rather than at the lower of aggregate cost or fair market value  which was the company s policy prior to january  as a result of recording such items at estimated fair market value  the company recognized approximately million of additional mortgage banking revenues in if not for the required adoption of sfas no 
 such revenues would have generally been recognized in as the residential mortgage loans to which they related were sold 
the impact on the company s results of operations resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
as related to the company s use of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was not significant 
noninterest income totaled million in  above the million in noninterest income was million in approximately of the increase from to was attributable to revenues related to operations in market areas associated with the keystone and premier acquisitions 
growth in mortgage banking revenues  including the impact of adopting sfas no 
described in the preceding paragraph  and higher service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to the increase in noninterest income 
contributing to the higher noninterest income in as compared with were increases in service charges on deposit accounts  income from leasing activities and brokerage services income  partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues and losses from sales of bank investment securities 
approximately of the increase in s noninterest income from was attributable to revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with the keystone acquisition 
noninterest operating expenses  which exclude amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and nonrecurring merger related expenses  were million in  higher than million in nonrecurring merger related expenses excluded from noninterest operating expenses were million and million in and  respectively 
charges for goodwill and core deposit intangible amortization excluded from noninterest operating expenses were million and million  respectively  in and million and million  respectively  in expenses related to the acquired operations of keystone and premier significantly contributed to the higher operating expense levels in compared with also contributing to such higher expense levels were increased expenses for salaries and employee benefits  including incentive based compensation arrangements  advertising  professional and other services  and amortization of capitalized servicing rights 
noninterest operating expenses were higher in than s total of million 
excluded from m t s operating expenses in were million of nonrecurring merger related expenses  million of amortization of goodwill and million of amortization of core deposit intangible 
higher salaries and employee benefits expenses  including merit salary increases  incentive based compensation arrangements  and increased staffing levels as a result of acquisitions in and  contributed to s increase in noninterest operating expenses 
the efficiency ratio  or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income measures how much of a company s revenue is consumed by operating expenses 
the company s efficiency ratio  calculated using the operating expense totals noted above and excluding gains or losses from sales of bank investment securities from noninterest income  was in  improved from in and in 
table of contents cash operating results m t has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting  unlike many other banking companies 
as a result  the company had recorded intangible assets consisting predominately of goodwill and core deposit intangible totaling billion  billion and million at december   and  respectively 
included in such intangible assets at december   and was goodwill of billion  billion and million  respectively 
charges for amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible  after tax effect  were million 
per diluted share and million 
per diluted share  respectively  during comparable after tax amortization charges in were million 
per diluted share for goodwill and million 
per diluted share for core deposit intangible  and in were million 
per diluted share for goodwill and million 
per diluted share for core deposit intangible 
since the amortization of these acquired intangible assets does not result in a cash expense  m t believes that supplemental reporting of its operating results on a cash  or tangible  basis which excludes the after tax effect of amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and the related asset balances represents a relevant measure of financial performance 
the supplemental cash basis data presented herein do not exclude the effect of other non cash operating expenses such as depreciation  provision for credit losses  or deferred income taxes associated with the results of operations 
unless noted otherwise  cash basis data do  however  exclude the after tax impact of nonrecurring merger related expenses associated with acquisitions 
cash net income increased to million in from million in diluted and basic cash earnings per share in both increased by to and  respectively  from and  respectively  in in  cash net income totaled million  while diluted and basic cash earnings per share were and  respectively

as further discussed under the heading recently issued accounting standards  effective january  the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  goodwill associated with corporate acquisitions will no longer be amortized  but rather it will be tested for impairment no less frequently than annually 
however  goodwill associated with most branch acquisitions  core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets will continue to be amortized subsequent to january  amortization expense relating to such assets is expected to approximate million million after tax in net interest income lending and funding activities taxable equivalent net interest income rose to billion in from million in  largely the result of growth in average earning assets and a widening of the company s net interest margin

loans obtained in the premier acquisition on february  totaled million and included million of commercial loans  million of commercial real estate loans  million of residential real estate loans  and million of consumer loans 
approximately one fourth of the increase in average loans and leases during was attributable to net loan origination activities 
of such increase  approximately million was attributable to higher average balances of residential mortgage loans held for sale 
growth in average loans and leases in resulting from origination and acquisition activities was partially offset by the impact of the securitization of approximately billion of residential mortgage loans during s second quarter 
the resulting mortgage backed securities  which are fully guaranteed by the federal national mortgage association  are included in the company s portfolio of available for sale investment securities 
excluding the impact of the securitization  average loans and leases grew by approximately billion  or  from to approximately half of such growth was attributable to new originations  net of the impact of repayments

further information on such interest rate swaps is provided in note of notes to financial statements 
changes in the composition of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as described herein  as well as changes in interest rates and spreads  can impact net interest income 
throughout  the federal reserve took numerous actions to lower the level of interest rates by reducing its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate by basis points 
in general  such actions resulted in a greater and more rapid decline in short term rates as compared with the decline in longer term rates 
the decline in short term interest rates and the general steepening of the yield curve had a positive effect on the company s net interest spread  or the difference between the taxable equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  in the yield on the company s earning assets decreased basis points to in from in  while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in was  down basis points from in the impact of the more rapid repricing of interest bearing liabilities than earning assets combined with the magnitude of the interest rate reductions led to a basis point increase in the company s net interest spread  from in to in in  the net interest spread was  the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 
the yield on earning assets increased basis points in from in and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased even further  rising basis points from in actions taken by the federal reserve in the second half of and the first five months of contributed to the rising level of interest rates in

the increase in the contribution in as compared with resulted from the impact of that year s higher interest rates on interest bearing liabilities and a million increase in the average balance of net interest free funds  largely comprised of higher average balances in noninterest bearing deposits and retained earnings 
goodwill and core deposit intangible assets averaged billion in  million in and million in  while the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged million in  million in and million in increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income  but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations 
future changes in market interest rates or spreads  as well as changes in the composition of the company s portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads  could adversely impact the company s net interest margin and net interest income 
management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios 
in managing interest rate risk  the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or  as appropriate  the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of december  was approximately million 
in general  under the terms of these swaps  the company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable rates 
however  under the terms of million of swaps  the company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate 
in anticipation of the previously noted issuance of million of fixed rate subordinated notes in october  the company terminated certain interest rate swap agreements during september  including forward starting swaps  with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million 
under the terms of the terminated swaps  the company would have made fixed rate payments and received variable rate payments 
the termination of these swaps  which had been entered into to hedge interest rate risk associated with fixed rate commercial real estate loans  resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately million which is being recognized in income over the designated hedge period of the swaps 
the impact on the company s results of operations in and from amortizing the net deferred gain was not significant 
the amounts of net deferred gain to be recognized in future years is included in note of notes to financial statements 
as previously discussed  the company adopted sfas no 
on january  as a result  million of the company s interest rate swap agreements as of december  had been designated as fair value hedges and million had been designated as cash flow hedges 
in a fair value hedge  the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings 
the difference between changes in the fair 
table of contents value of the interest rate swaps and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the company s consolidated statement of income 
in a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately 
the amount of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash flow hedges recognized in was not material to the company s results of operations 
the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was a gain of approximately million at december  the fair value of such swaps was substantially offset by unrealized losses on the fair value of the hedged items 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges was a loss of approximately thousand at december  net of applicable income taxes  such loss was approximately thousand and has been included in accumulated other comprehensive income  net in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was not recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the unrecognized fair value associated with such interest rate swaps at december  and were pre tax gains of approximately million and million  respectively

the recent year s increase in nonperforming loans also reflects two larger balance commercial loans totaling million at s year end that were classified as non performing during the year

the outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government agencies 
the loans were repurchased to reduce servicing costs associated with the loans  including a requirement to advance to gnma principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors 
several factors influence the company s credit loss experience  including overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers  in general  and  due to the size of the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio  real estate valuations  in particular 
commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and  as a result  can be highly subjective

during the first quarter of  the company began classifying non guaranteed consumer loans and leases past due days or more as nonaccrual 
previously  such loans accrued interest until the loan balances were charged off 
the change in classification did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or its financial condition 
consumer loans and leases obtained in the keystone acquisition that were past due ninety days or more and accruing interest were million and million at december  and  respectively 
despite the existence of loan collateral in many cases  management conservatively evaluated the collectability of delinquent consumer loans and leases when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio  including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the current financial condition of specific borrowers  the economic environment in which borrowers operate  the level of delinquent loans and the value of any collateral 
management cautiously evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the company s exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for such losses as of each reporting date 
in addition to the impact of loans obtained in acquisitions and economic conditions in geographic areas entered through acquisitions  factors considered by management when performing its assessment included  but were not limited to i the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the company s loan portfolio  particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in new york state  in general  and in the new york city metropolitan area  in particular  ii the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area that have historically experienced significantly less economic growth than the vast majority of other regions of the country  and iii significant growth in loans to individual consumers 
the level of the allowance for credit losses is adjusted based on the results of management s analysis 
in ascertaining the adequacy of the level of the allowance for credit losses  the company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases 
the total allowance for credit losses  therefore  includes both specific and inherent base level loss components  as well as inherent unallocated loss components  which are described in the following paragraphs 

table of contents the amount of specific loss components in the loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of all nonaccrual commercial and commercial real estate loans 
specific loss components are also established for certain classified commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than  when it is determined that there is a differing risk of loss than otherwise prescribed under the inherent base level loss component calculation 
measurement of the specific loss components are typically based on expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
impaired loans  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended  are evaluated for specific loss components 
except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively  the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more 
the inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and management s classification of such loans under the company s loan grading system 
the company utilizes an extensive ten point loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits 
loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the company s credit policy 
internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the company s loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards 
loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained 
loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the company s loss estimate for each group of loans and leases 
items considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results  collateral value  financial condition  payment status  and other factors  levels of and trends in portfolio charge offs and recoveries  levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans  changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios  trends in volume and terms of loans  national and local economic conditions and trends  and observed trends and practices in the banking industry 
the specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses 
such allocated portion of the allowance represents management s assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed 
the inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable 
the inherent unallocated allowance includes management s subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as economic uncertainties  customer  industry and geographic concentrations  and expansion into new products and market areas 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from i comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the company  specifically new york state and central pennsylvania  that resulted in such regions not having experienced the same degree of economic growth in previous years as experienced by much of the rest of the country  ii portfolio concentrations regarding loan type  collateral type and geographic location  in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties 
table of contents in the new york city metropolitan area and other areas of new york state  iii the effect of expansion into new markets  including market areas entered through acquisitions  iv the introduction of new loan product types  including expansion of automobile loan and leasing activities in recent years  and  v the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance 
commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and  as a result  can be highly subjective 
commercial real estate values in the new york city metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate  economic conditions and interest rates  and  in many cases  the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property 
the tragic events of september  further dampened the economic outlook for the united states  which is now experiencing its first significant downturn in many years 
the economies of new york state  and new york city in particular  were specifically damaged by the events of september economic growth outside of new york city  especially in the industrialized upstate new york markets  continues to lag the rest of the country 
furthermore  consistent with other regions of the country  the unemployment rate in new york state grew significantly in  rising to at year end 
slower job growth  coupled with a declining population base  has left the upstate new york region susceptible to credit problems  particularly related to commercial customers 
after a brief stabilization in  the central pennsylvania economy again lagged the rest of the united states in employment in central pennsylvania declined by an average of 
in  compared with a 
average increase nationally 
the accompanying table presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends 
amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year end assessment and using the methodology described herein 
variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in management s estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components 
increased allocation percentages in the commercial loan and real estate loan portfolios from december  to december  reflect weakened economic conditions and an increased level of impaired and other classified loans 
as described in note of notes to financial statements  loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
increased to million at december  from million at december  the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to such loans was million and million at december  and  respectively 
increased allocation percentages in the commercial loan and real estate loan portfolios from december  to s year end were largely attributable to the acquired keystone loans  which were conservatively assigned loan grades based on facts known at the date of acquisition  pending more detailed analyses of such loans by the company s loan review department 
the increase in the allowance allocated to consumer loans as a percentage of such loans at the end of compared with december  was largely the result of a refinement in loss estimation techniques relating to certain past due consumer loans 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to 
and 
of total loans outstanding at december  and  respectively 
given the company s high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in new york state  including the upstate new york region  and central pennsylvania  and considering the other factors already discussed herein  management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable 
nevertheless  the company s allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category 
management believes that the aggregate allowance for credit losses at december  was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the 
table of contents portfolio as of that date 
the allowance for credit losses was million or of total loans at december   compared with million or at december  and million or at december  the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at year end  and was  and  respectively 
the level of the allowance reflects management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date 
the increase in the allowance as a percentage of total loans at december  compared with the prior year end also considered the weakened state of the economy in as well as the other specific factors and conditions described herein 
the decline in the allowance as a percentage of total loans at december  as compared with year end also reflects management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each date  the relatively favorable and or stable economic environment for many commercial borrowers during much of  and other factors 
commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties in the new york city metropolitan area represented of loans outstanding at december  the company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded of total loans at december  furthermore  the company had no exposure to less developed countries and less than million of outstanding foreign loans at december  assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled million at december   compared with million a year earlier and million at the end of other income other income grew to million in from million in approximately of the increase was attributable to the impact of the keystone and premier acquisitions 
higher service charges on deposit accounts and mortgage banking revenues also significantly contributed to the increase from other income totaled million in s improvement from resulted from increases in service charges on deposit accounts  income from leasing activities  and brokerage services income  which were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues and losses from sales of bank investment securities 
approximately of s increase was attributable to revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with the keystone acquisition 
mortgage banking revenues  which consist of residential mortgage loan servicing fees  gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights  and other residential mortgage loan related fees  increased to million in from million in the higher revenues in were due largely to the impact of lower interest rates that produced a favorable environment for loan origination and refinancing activities by consumers 
mortgage banking revenues in were lower than million in  largely the result of higher interest rates initiated by the federal reserve in the second half of and first half of that negatively impacted mortgage loan origination volume in and tighter pricing margins that resulted from competitive pressures 
residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately billion in  compared with billion and billion in and  respectively 
the company maintains residential mortgage loan origination offices in new york state and pennsylvania  as well as in arizona  colorado  idaho  massachusetts  new jersey  ohio  oregon  utah and washington 
realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and unrealized gains from recording residential mortgage loans held for sale  commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans at fair market value aggregated million in as noted earlier  the company adopted sfas no 
as of january  sfas no 

table of contents requires that changes in the fair value of hedged residential mortgage loans held for sale  commitments to sell loans  and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale be recorded in the company s results of operations 
such unrealized gains totaled approximately million pre tax at december  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 residential mortgage loans originated for sale and related commitments to sell loans and to originate loans for sale were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of aggregate cost or fair market value 
the previously noted favorable interest rate environment for loan origination and refinancing activities was the major contributor to the higher realized gains from sales of loans and loan servicing rights in realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights totaled million in and million in the tighter pricing margins and a lower volume of originations contributed to the decrease in realized gains from to revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were million in  up from million in and million in residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  capitalized servicing assets were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the increase from december  to reflects the keystone transaction  other purchased servicing rights and the previously noted securitization of billion of residential mortgage loans which added approximately million  million and million  respectively  to capitalized servicing assets in additional information about the company s capitalized servicing assets is presented in note of notes to financial statements 
service charges on deposit accounts rose to million in from million in  and from million in fees for services provided to customers in areas formerly served by keystone and premier contributed approximately of the increase from to also contributing to the higher level of service charges in were higher balances in transactional deposit accounts which generate higher levels of service charges than non transactional accounts 
the full year effect in of a third quarter increase in fees and the impact of acquisitions were significant factors contributing to the increase from to additionally  fees for services provided to customers in the areas formerly served by keystone contributed approximately of the increase from to trust income increased to million in from million in and from million in the increases were largely attributable to the acquisition of keystone 
brokerage services income  which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees  totaled million in  up from million in and higher than million in trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of million in  million in and thousand in in  a loss of approximately million was incurred as a result of a counterparty defaulting on the settlement of outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
during both and  the company sold bank investment securities resulting in gains of approximately million 
losses from sales of bank investment securities in reflect million of net losses incurred during the fourth quarter of from sales of investment securities following the acquisition of keystone and the combination of the investment portfolios of keystone and the company

other revenues from operations included million  million and million in  and  respectively  of tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance  which includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received 
also included were revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
other items that contributed to the increase in other revenues from operations in from and include higher letter of credit and other credit related fees  insurance related revenues  and automated teller machine atm usage fees 
letter of credit and other credit related fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
insurance related revenues totaled million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the impact of acquisitions was the leading factor contributing to higher insurance related revenues 
the increases in atm usage fees  from million in to million in and to million in were largely the result of the keystone transaction 
income from leasing activities in reflected a net gain of million resulting from a nonrecurring million gain from the sale of equipment previously leased to a commercial customer and an accrual of million for losses associated with selling automobiles and other vehicles leased to retail customers 
other expense operating expenses  which exclude amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible as well as nonrecurring merger related expenses  were million in  higher than million in and higher than million in expenses related to acquired operations significantly contributed to the higher expense levels in and however  since the operating systems and support operations related to keystone  premier and other acquisitions completed in earlier years have been combined with those of the company  the company s operating expenses cannot be precisely divided between or attributed directly to the acquired operations or to the company as it existed prior to each transaction 
components of other expense considered to be nonoperating in nature and therefore excluded from the operating expense totals noted above were amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible of million in  million in and million in  and merger related expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
salaries and employee benefits expense was million in  an increase of from million in and higher than the million in salaries and benefits related to acquired operations  merit salary increases  and higher expenses for incentive compensation arrangements and medical and other benefits were factors contributing to the increases in and the number of full time equivalent employees was  at december   compared with  and  at december  and  respectively 
excluding the nonoperating expense items previously noted  nonpersonnel expense totaled million in  higher than million in and higher than million in higher expenses for equipment and occupancy  advertising  promotion and travel  amortization of capitalized servicing rights  and professional services and processing  all largely attributable to the impact of acquisitions  were significant factors contributing to the rise in nonpersonnel expenses from to higher equipment and occupancy expenses  largely related to acquired operations  higher amortization of capitalized servicing rights and increased foreclosure related expenses contributed to the increase in expense from to

international activities the company s net investment in international assets was million and million at december  and  respectively 
offshore deposits totaled million at december  and million at december  liquidity  market risk  and interest rate sensitivity as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks  including liquidity and market risk 
liquidity refers to the company s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands for loans and deposit withdrawals  to fund operating costs  and to be used for other corporate purposes 
liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ 
historically  core deposits have been the most significant funding source for the company 
core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer  corporate and institutional customers  which over the past several years has become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the company s businesses 
nevertheless  in recent years the company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants  including banks  thrifts  mutual funds  securities dealers and others 
core deposits financed of the company s earning assets at december   compared with and at december  and  respectively 
the company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings  including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  brokered certificates of deposit  and borrowings from the fhlb and others 
m t bank had short term and long term credit facilities with the fhlb aggregating billion at december  outstanding borrowings under the fhlb credit facilities totaled billion at december  and billion at december  such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities 
m t bank and m t bank  na had available lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york at december  totaling approximately billion 
the amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral 
there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at either december  or as previously noted  m t bank issued million of fixed rate subordinated capital notes in october that provided liquidity and facilitated the acquisitions of keystone and premier 
informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding are available to the company through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions 
short term federal funds borrowings aggregated billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
in general  these borrowings were unsecured and matured within two business days 
should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt rating  or should the availability of 
table of contents short term funding become restricted  the company s ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted 
information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the company s short term and long term borrowings is provided in detail in note of notes to financial statements 
in addition to deposits and borrowings  other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities  repayments of loans and investment securities  and cash generated from operations  such as fees collected for services 
m t s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses  stockholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries  which are subject to various regulatory limitations 
these historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities 
information regarding trust preferred securities is included in note of notes to financial statements 
m t also maintains a million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank  of which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  a similar million line of credit that expired during was entirely available for borrowing at december  management closely monitors the company s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course of business 
management does not anticipate engaging in any activities  either currently or in the long term  which would cause a significant strain on liquidity at either m t or its subsidiary banks 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of the company s financial instruments 
the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk 
the core banking activities of lending and deposit taking expose the company to interest rate risk  which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change 
as a result  net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates 
the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk 
management s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income 
the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities  anticipated prepayments of mortgage related assets and expected maturities of investment securities  loans and deposits 
management supplements the modeling technique described above with analyses of market values of the company s financial instruments 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was approximately million 
information about interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under net interest income lending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements 
the company s asset liability committee  which includes members of senior management  monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  as well as statistically derived interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments  including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities 
when deemed prudent  management has taken action  and intends to do so in the future  to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or 
table of contents off balance sheet financial instruments 
possible actions include  but are not limited to  changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products  modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or entering into additional interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate risk management financial instruments 
the accompanying table as of december  and displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments resulting from changes in interest rates during the first modeling year 
many assumptions were utilized by the company to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on the company s net interest income 
the more significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets  cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes  loan and deposit volumes and pricing  and deposit maturities 
the company also assumed gradual changes in rates of and basis points up and down during a twelve month period 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions  as well as any actions  such as those previously described  which management may take to counter such changes 
in accordance with industry practice  the accompanying table presents cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames  as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes 
management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor  as assumed in the table  on the contractual maturity or repricing date 
furthermore  this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the company is likely to implement 
the company engages in limited trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to profit from perceived market opportunities 
trading activities are conducted utilizing financial instruments that include forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities  us treasury and other government securities  mortgage backed securities and interest rate contracts  such as swaps 
the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions 
the amounts of gross and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the company are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the asset liability committee 
the notional amounts of interest rate and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled billion and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december  the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
however  the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december

the statement also requires that an acquired intangible asset be recognized apart from goodwill if that asset arises from contractual or other legal rights 
sfas no 
stipulates that the pooling method of accounting may not be used for business combinations initiated after june  however  prior business combinations accounted for by the pooling method are grandfathered
