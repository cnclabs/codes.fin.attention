item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal year fiscal year sales increased approximately from fiscal year this increase is due primarily to sales of new ems products offset by declines in keyboard sales 
revenue from keyboard sales decreased million or from fiscal while revenue from ems sales increased million or 
even though keyboard sales continue to decline  the margins on these sales usually exceed those that can be realized on ems sales  so the company will continue to service this industry until such time that it is no longer feasible or profitable to do so 
the company s gross profit percentage on sales for fiscal year was  which is an increase of from fiscal year this increase is primarily the result of a new product line in full production during fiscal year that utilized excess operating capacity 
the company continues to emphasize expansion of ems products and services 
fiscal year fiscal year sales increased approximately from the prior year 
this slight increase is primarily due to the expansion of the company s electronic manufacturing services ems operations  the increase was smaller than the company expected due to decreased orders from one major customer 
unit keyboard sales decreased from the prior year  while the average selling price increased 
the increase in average selling price was primarily due to a higher percentage of keyboard sales to distributors 
distribution sales generally have higher margins than sales to oem customers 
the company was successful in expanding its ems business from of total revenue in to in the company continues to emphasize cost control to address price reductions expected by our customers 
if keyboard technology remains the same  price erosion is expected to continue in future years 
the company continues to focus its molding and manufacturing capabilities on increasing production in the ems market 
the company s gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this decrease is primarily due to the decline of orders by one significant customer resulting in lower sales and increased excess operating capacity 
there were also lower sales in the distribution keyboard business  which traditionally has much higher margins than the oem market 
critical accounting policies inactive  obsolete and surplus inventory reserve the company reserves for inventories that it deems inactive  obsolete or surplus 
this reserve is calculated based upon the demand for the products that the company produces 
demand is determined by expected sales or customer forecasts 
if expected sales do not materialize  then the company would have inventory in excess of their reserves and would have to charge the excess against future earnings 
in the case where the company has purchased material based upon a customer s forecast  the company is usually covered by lead time assurance agreements with each customer 
these contracts state that the financial liability for material purchased within lead time and based upon the customer s forecasts  lies with the customer 
if the company purchases material outside the lead time assurance agreement and the customer s forecasts do not materialize  the company would have the financial liability and would have to charge the excess against future earnings 
bad debt accrual the company values its accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is based on estimates of the portion of accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future  and the amount of this allowance is disclosed in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the estimates used are based primarily on specific identification of potentially uncollectible accounts 
such accounts are identified using publicly available information in conjunction with evaluations of current payment activity 
however  if any of the company s customers were to develop unexpected and immediate financial problems that would prevent payment of open invoices  the company could incur additional and possibly material expenses that would negatively impact earnings 
accrued warranty an accrual is made for expected warranty costs  with the related expense recognized in cost of good sold 
management reviews the adequacy of this accrual quarterly based on historical analysis and anticipated product returns 
over the course of the past three years  the company s warranty expense has decreased 
as the company has made the transition from manufacturing keyboards only to ems  its exposure to warranty issues has declined significantly 
the company s warranty period for keyboards is generally three times longer than that for ems products 
also the company does not warranty design defects for ems customers 
the declines in warranty expense and the related accrual account are directly related to the change in the composition of the company s revenue from keyboards to ems 
risks and uncertainties that could affect future results the following risks and uncertainties could affect the company s actual results and could cause results to differ materially from past results or those contemplated by the company s forward looking statements 
when used in this discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this annual report  the words expects  believes  anticipates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking 
table of contents statements 
actual future results may differ materially due to uncertainties including risks identified in potential fluctuations in quarterly results  litigation  competition  concentration of major customers  dependence on key personnel  technological change and new product risk  and dilution and stock price volatility 
forward looking statements are based on management s opinions as of the date of this report 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future due to a variety of factors  including changes in overall demand for computer products  success of customers programs  timing of new programs  new product introductions or technological advances by the company  its customers and its competitors  and changes in pricing policies by the company 
for example  the company relies on customers forecasts to plan its business 
if those forecasts are overly optimistic  the company s revenues and profits may fall short of expectations 
conversely  if those forecasts are too conservative  the company could have an unexpected increase in revenues and profits 
litigation on december   a jury in seattle federal court rendered a verdict in the case of f g scrolling mouse  llc  fernando falcon and federico gilligan v 
microsoft corporation  honeywell  inc  and key tronic corporation  united states district court for the western district of washington  case no 
c c finding that key tronic misappropriated trade secrets and breached a confidentiality agreement with plaintiffs fernando falcon  federico gilligan and their company  f g scrolling mouse llc 
plaintiffs alleged that key tronic misappropriated plaintiffs trade secrets and breached a confidentiality agreement by disclosing to microsoft  in violation of that agreement  information provided by plaintiffs to key tronic pursuant to the confidentiality agreement 
plaintiffs alleged that they were damaged as a result of microsoft s subsequent use of plaintiffs trade secrets in the development of microsoft s intellimouse product 
honeywell was dismissed without prejudice from this action on december   and plaintiffs settled with microsoft and dismissed that defendant with prejudice on march  although the jury found that the misappropriation was not willful  it awarded damages in the amount of million 
the judgment was subsequently increased to approximately million through an award of pre judgment interest 
the trial court denied key tronic s motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for new trial 
key tronic filed notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit on may  on june   the federal district court granted a stay of execution of judgment pending the outcome of the appeal to the ninth circuit 
under the terms of the stay of execution of judgment  the court approved a supersedeas bond on the terms requested by key tronic in the amount of million  with quarterly additions of of the company s operating income  as security for the million judgment 
key tronic intends to vigorously pursue its appeal in this matter 
an unfavorable outcome in this matter could likely impair the company s ability to continue as a going concern and have a material adverse impact on the company s cash flows 
competition the ems business is intensely competitive 
the company s major competitors in the ems business are much larger and may be able to offer customers lower prices and less risk particularly on large volume programs 
this could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  all of which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  competitors can copy the company s non proprietary designs after the company has invested in the development of products for customers  thereby enabling competitors to offer lower prices on such products due to savings in development costs 
concentration of major customers at present  the company s customer base is highly concentrated and could become even more concentrated 
three of the company s oem customers accounted for   and of net sales during fiscal year in  these same customers accounted for   and of net sales 
a newly acquired ems customer accounted for of net sales in fiscal year there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products from the company at current levels 
moreover  the company typically does not enter into long term volume purchase contracts with its customers  and the company s customers have certain rights to extend or delay the shipment of their orders 
the loss of one or more of the company s major customers  or the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from such customers  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
technological change and new product risk the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life cycles 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products  to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards  and to address evolving and increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
failure to do so could substantially harm the company s 
table of contents competitive position 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  developing  manufacturing and marketing products that respond to technological change  emerging industry standards or evolving customer requirements 
dilution and stock price volatility as of june   there were outstanding options for the purchase of approximately  shares of common stock of the company common stock  of which options for approximately  shares were vested and exercisable 
holders of the common stock will suffer immediate and substantial dilution to the extent outstanding options to purchase the common stock are exercised 
the stock price of the company may be subject to wide fluctuations and possible rapid increases or decreases over a short time period 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company  such as variations in quarterly operating results  or changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors relating to the computer manufacturing industry or securities markets in general  which  in recent years  have experienced significant price fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded 
net sales net sales in fiscal year were million compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
this represents an approximate increase of in fiscal year this increase is due primarily to sales of new ems products offset by decreases in keyboard sales 
sales to clorox  a newly acquired ems customer in fiscal year  contributed significantly to the increase in ems revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that continuing orders from clorox will exceed or even meet the current fiscal year s level 
ems sales were of total revenue in fiscal compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
keyboard sales were of sales in fiscal compared to and of total sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decline in keyboard revenue is mainly due to decreased sales to oem customers 
oem keyboard margins are extremely low so the company has not pursued that business as aggressively 
although revenues from keyboard sales continue to decline  margins on the remaining keyboard business tend to exceed those that can be realized from ems products 
therefore  the company will continue to service this industry as long as it remains feasible and profitable to do so 
cost of sales in fiscal year  cost of sales was of revenues compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the decrease in was due primarily to a newly acquired ems program that helped utilize excess capacity in one of the company s production facilities 
the increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due primarily to lower than expected revenues 
the company provides for warranty costs based on historical experience and anticipated product returns 
the amounts charged to expense were   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the decline in warranty expense is attributable primarily to the decline in keyboard sales 
the company s warranty period for keyboards is generally three times longer than that for ems products 
also the company does not warranty design defects for ems customers 
cost of sales also includes shipping and handling costs of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the company s freight costs for inbound shipments of production materials fluctuates from year to year depending on negotiated freight rates and the necessity for expedited shipping methods 
the company provides for obsolete and non saleable inventories based on specific identification of inventory against current demand and recent usage 
the amounts charged to expense were million  
million  and 
million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the large increase in this expense for fiscal year is the result of fully reserving the remaining inventory on hand for a particular keyboard product line that is unlikely to be sold based on current demand and usage 
research  development and engineering the company s research  development and engineering rd e expenses were million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses were   and  respectively 
in fiscal years   and  the company focused most of its rd e efforts on ems programs 
the number of rd e projects has remained fairly constant over the course of the three years 
the slight decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due primarily to decreased demand for these services in the second half of the fiscal year 
the decrease between fiscal years and was due primarily to the company reallocating resources to fee for services 
selling selling expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
selling expenses as a percentage of revenues were   and  respectively 
the decreases in fiscal years and were due primarily to significant declines in keyboard sales 
sales of keyboards through distribution require greater promotional and marketing programs than sales of ems products 
in addition  the company did not employ outside sales representatives for its keyboard products in fiscal year  so commission expense was significantly decreased 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses were in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to three factors  a significant decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts  a decrease in required professional services charged to g a  and decreased compensation and fringe benefits as a result of attrition and a reduction in salaries for more highly compensated employees 
the increase between fiscal years and was due primarily to an increase in the company s provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
interest expense the company had interest expenses of million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year was due to a decreased balance for the company s revolving line of credit and lower interest rates 
during fiscal year  the company offered discount terms to one of its larger ems customers  which contributed to increased availability of cash 
this cash  in turn  was used to pay down the company s revolving loan 
litigation the company reported expenses of  associated with the litigation judgment awarded to f g scrolling mouse llc by the united states district court for the western district of washington  case no 
c c

this judgment is discussed in detail in footnote  commitments and contingencies  following the financial statements 
other income  net the company had net other income of   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the net other income for fiscal year is primarily the result of recognizing gains on the sale of two of the company s buildings 
in february of  the company sold its real estate located in cheney  washington  recognizing a gain of  note 
in december of  the company sold its headquarters building in spokane  washington  under a sale lease back transaction 
the company did not recognize the gain on the sale of the headquarters building during the time period that it had guaranteed the rent on the second floor of the building 
at the end of december  the one year of guaranteed rent payments was fulfilled  and the company recognized a gain of  note from the sale of this building 
the difference between these gains and the reported amount of  is due to miscellaneous non operating charges taken by the company 
the increase in was primarily due to gains from the sale of fixed assets 
income taxes the company had income tax expense of million in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year  and  in fiscal the increase for fiscal year is due primarily to expensing the company s deferred tax assets in entirety after the litigation judgment was awarded to f g scrolling mouse 
these assets totaled million 
prior to the award of this judgment  key tronic had almost million in tax loss carry forwards 
financial accounting standard no 
requires that management assess the sources of future taxable income  which may be available to recognize the deductible differences that comprise deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is required if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
because the litigation judgment could be considered evidence of the company s possible inability to utilize the balance of the deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance was increased to the full value 
the company s tax loss carry forwards begin expiring in the remaining  of the company s income tax provision was due to income taxes on the earnings of foreign operations

foreign sales were of net sales in fiscal compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
sales from key tronic europe  ltd 
represented approximately of consolidated sales to external customers in fiscal year compared to in fiscal and in fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in foreign sales for fiscal year is primarily the result of declining sales to the foreign subsidiaries of one ems customer and the continuing decline of keyboard sales from the company s subsidiary in ireland 
although the company hopes to expand its ems business to include the european market  sales within europe currently are primarily for electronic keyboards 
sales from key tronic computer peripheral co  ltd 
to local customers represented only  in fiscal year in fiscal years and  sales to local customers were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in sales to local chinese customers is also the result of lower purchases from the same ems customer as previously discussed 
capital resources and liquidity the company generated cash flows from operating activities of 
million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the significant decrease in fiscal year was due primarily to the reduction of accounts payable 
the significant increase in fiscal year was due primarily to proceeds from the sale of real estate  property  and equipment 
capital expenditures were million  
million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company s cash position decreased by 
million from fiscal year to fiscal year cash generated from operating and financing activities allowed the net payment of million in long term debt and the purchase of million in property and equipment in fiscal the company had working capital of million at june  and million at june  this level of consistency was due primarily to lower levels of accounts receivable and inventory from fiscal year to offset by reduced accounts payable from fiscal year to on august   the company entered into a financing agreement with cit group business credit  inc for a revolving credit facility of up to million and paid off the gecc revolving loan 
the new revolving loan is secured by the assets of the company 
the financing agreement contains financial covenants that relate to maximum capital expenditures  minimum earnings before interest expense  income tax  depreciation  and amortization  and minimum tangible net worth 
the agreement is for a term of three years beginning on august  the closing date of the agreement and ending on august  in addition to the financial covenants  the financing agreement restricts investments  disposition of assets  and the payment of dividends 
as a result of the litigation judgment described in note to the financial statements  cit notified the company that it was in default of certain financial covenants contained in the revolving loan agreement  and that all subsequent loans or advances under the credit facility would be at the lender s sole discretion 
under these terms  the company s revolving debt would have had to be classified as short term 
on june   the federal district court granted a stay of execution of judgment to the company pending the outcome of the appeal to the ninth circuit  which was filed on may  as a result  on july   cit issued an amendment to the loan agreement containing a clause that granted a waiver of the defaults 
this amendment is contingent upon the continued stay of execution of judgment and the maintenance of the remaining covenants 
therefore  the revolving debt is classified as long term  because an outcome of the appeal is not probable prior to the end of the company s next fiscal year 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures of approximately million will be required during the next fiscal year 
capital expenditures are expected to be financed through cash flow from operating activities 
the company believes that funds available under the revolving credit facility and internally generated funds can satisfy cash requirements for a period in excess of months provided that the current stay of execution remains in place for a period in excess of months
