item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain statements in this annual report on form k including statements regarding our strategies  plans  objectives  expectations and intentions  may include forward looking information within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward looking statements 
for discussion of the factors that might cause such a difference  see item business factors that may affect future results of operations and other risks identified from time to time in our filings with the sec 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management  which has a material impact on the carrying value of net loans  management considers this accounting policy to be a critical accounting policy 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment as described in allowance for loan losses 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general in upfc reported income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  compared with a loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share for the same period a year ago 
including discontinued operations  we reported income of million  or per diluted share in  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share in contributing to our loss from continuing operations were charges as described below 
we recorded a pre tax charge of million during to reflect a write down in the value of residual interests arising from our subprime mortgage securitizations 
the residual interests were sold in january and were valued at december  according to the sale price and terms of this contract 
a pre tax charge of million  which was included in other expenses in the statement of operations  was also recorded during  relating to a write down of our goodwill arising from the purchase of norwest financial coast s insurance premium finance operations 
the write down reflects impairment in the value of this goodwill as a result of a decline in future benefits expected to be received from this acquisition as a result of a change in market conditions 
interest income for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million in while net interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period a year ago 
gross automobile receivables increased from million at december  to million at december  accounting for much of the increase in interest income and net interest income 
interest income interest income increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  due primarily to a million increase in average interest earning assets  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on interest earning assets 
the largest components of growth in our average interest earning assets were automobile installment contracts  which increased million  and securities  which increased million 
the increase in auto contracts principally resulted from the purchase of additional dealer contracts in existing and new markets consistent with the planned growth of this business unit 
the increase in securities was primarily a result of the reinvestment of proceeds received from the sale of discontinued mortgage assets and the increase in assets required for the bank to meet the qtl test of the ots 
the decline in the average yield on interest earning assets was principally due to the increase in securities  which have lower yields compared to loans  and to a general decline in market interest rates 
securities  with an average yield of  comprised of our average interest earning assets at december  compared with of our average interest earning assets at december interest expense interest expense increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december   due to a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on interest bearing liabilities 
the largest component of the increase in interest bearing liabilities was deposits of the bank  which increased from an average balance of million in to million in the increase in average deposits was due primarily to the reallocation of deposits to continuing operations compared to a year ago 
there were no deposits allocated to discontinued operations in the average cost of deposits decreased from for to for  generally as a result of a decrease in market interest rates and the repricing of deposits to these lower market rates 
average balance sheets the following tables set forth information relating to our continuing operations for the years ended december   and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities allocated to continuing operations  respectively  for the periods shown

provision for loan losses total provision for loan losses was  for the year ended december  of this   was the provision for loan losses reflecting estimated credit losses associated with our insurance premium finance business  compared with  for the year ended december  this increase resulted from the growth in the insurance premium finance loan portfolio as well as an increase in the allocation percentage from of loans in to in also  after review of loss experience  an additional  provision for loan losses was recognized in connection with the existing auto loan portfolio 
no comparable provision for the auto loan portfolio was recognized in in addition to the provision for loan losses  our allowance for loan losses is also increased by an allocation of acquisition discounts related to the purchase of automobile installment contracts 
we allocate the estimated amount of acquisition discounts attributable to credit risk to the allowance for loan losses 
at december   we allocated of the net contract purchased to provision for loan losses compared to at december  our total allowance for losses was million at december  compared with million at december   representing of loans held for investment at december  and at december  net charge offs to average loans were for the year ended december  compared with in a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on our regular evaluation of loans held for investment and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes it has adequately provided for losses and does not expect any material loss on its loans in excess of allowances already recorded  no assurance can be given that economic or other market conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio 
non interest income non interest income increased million  from a loss of million in to million in the increase resulted from an million pre tax write down of the value of residual interests in securitizations in and a million gain on sales of loans in we sold our residual interests in securitizations in january and this sale was used to determine the fair value of these assets at december  other components of non interest income include fees and charges for bank services and miscellaneous other items 
the total of all of these items increased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  included in non interest income is a charge of  in both and in connection with the write off of upfc s investment in airtime technology  related to the discontinued world cash subsidiary 
non interest expense non interest expense increased million  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  this increase primarily reflects an increase in salaries  employee benefits and other personnel costs of approximately million associated with the expansion of our automobile finance operations 
in addition  occupancy expense increased  reflecting the costs associated with maintaining and expanding the branch offices in the auto finance lending area 
overall  other expenses decreased million during compared to this decrease resulted from a million pretax charge in in connection with the write down of goodwill arising from the purchase of northwest financial corp s insurance premium operations and a  pre tax provision in for the relocation of certain offices with no comparable expenses in these reductions were partially offset by a million increase during compared to in other operating expense  including professional fees  supplies  data processing  telephone and postage  as a result of growth in our automobile lending operation 
income taxes benefit income taxes benefit increased million  from a benefit of million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  this increase occurred as a result of an million increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes between the two periods 
discontinued operations mortgage finance as announced on february   we discontinued our subprime mortgage origination operations 
all related operating activity of the mortgage operations has been reclassified and reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the wind down of these operations  sales of subprime mortgage loans in were million  compared with million in we originated no new sub prime mortgage loans during compared with million during the year ended december  during the second quarter of  a charge of million  net of tax  was recorded related to loss on disposal of our subprime mortgage finance business 
included in our statement of financial condition as of december   is a reserve of million consisting primarily of lease and other contractual obligations related to the estimated remaining costs of discontinuing the subprime mortgage operations 
if actual costs of disposal are higher than anticipated  additional charges may be required in subsequent periods results of operations 
in determining net interest income charged to discontinued operations  we included all interest income from our mortgage finance business less an allocation for interest expense 
we allocated average deposits of million for the year ended december  and average warehouse lines of credit of million for the year ended december  no such allocation was required in comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets increased million  from million at december  to million at december  the increase occurred primarily as a result of a million increase in cash and cash equivalents  from million at december  to a million at december   a million increase in securities available for sale  from million at december  to million at december   and a million increase in loans from at december  to at december  loans increased as a result of planned increases in our auto loan portfolio and securities available for sale and cash and cash equivalents increased as a result of the reinvestment of proceeds of increased borrowings from fhlb and reverse repurchase agreements 
the increase in assets is required in order for upfc to meet the limitation on our auto loans as required by the qtl 
residual interests in securitizations consisted of beneficial interests in the form of an interest only strip representing the subordinated right to receive cash flows from a pool of securitized loans after payment of required amounts to the holders of the securities and certain costs associated with the securitization 
our residual interests were million at december  upfc sold all of the residual interests arising from the securitizations in january accordingly  as of december   these residual interests were valued based on the terms and conditions of the sales contract and the net cash proceeds received at the settlement date in january premises and equipment increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily as a result of the continuing growth of our auto finance business 
deposit accounts increased million  from million at december  to million at december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in brokered cd s from million at december  to million at december  retail deposits decreased million  from million at december  to million at december  other interest bearing liabilities include fhlb advances and repurchase agreements 
fhlb advances were million at december  compared with million at december  reverse repurchase agreements were as of december there were no outstanding repurchase agreements at december  the increase in fhlb advances and repurchase agreements was primarily due to our use of wholesale borrowings as an alternative to deposits as a funding source for asset growth 
net deferred tax assets were million at december  due principally to temporary differences in the recognition of reserves for loan losses and discontinued operations for federal and state income tax reporting and financial statement reporting purposes 
shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december   as a result of our profit of million   of unrealized gain on securities and a million increase as a result of stock options in the second quarter of  partially offset by a million repurchase of upfc stock 
management of interest rate risk the principal objective of our interest rate risk management program is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our business activities  determine the level of appropriate risk given our operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with guidelines approved by the board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the exposure of our operations to changes in interest rates 
the board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the asset liability position of upfc  including simulation of the effect on capital of various interest rate scenarios 
upfc s profits depend  in part  on the difference  or spread  between the effective rate of interest received on the loans it originates and the interest rates paid on deposits and other financing facilities  which can be adversely affected by movements in interest rates 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by the board of directors and management  through the use of a model  which estimates the change in the bank s net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and npv ratio is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
we review a market value model the ots npv model prepared quarterly by the ots  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by approximating the bank s npv under various scenarios which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
at december   the bank s sensitivity measure resulting from a basis point decrease in interest rates was basis points and would result in a million increase in the npv of the bank and a basis point increase in interest rates was basis points and would result in a million decrease in the npv of the bank 
at december   the bank s sensitivity measure was below the threshold at which the bank could be required to hold additional risk based capital under ots regulations 
although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
management monitors the results of this modeling  which are presented to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the following tables show the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december  and december  assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of  and basis points bp 
the increase in sensitivity for december   as compared to december  is a result of the bank s purchase of securities  which are more sensitive to movements in market interest rates 
the bank acquired these securities in order to manage its sources of funds and the mix of its assets to ensure it meets the qtl test 
the december  table does not include data for bp or bp because these changes in rates would infer negative interest rates and are therefore not relevant

while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we have continued to maintain the required levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
management  through its asset and liability committee  monitors rates and terms of competing sources of funds to use the most cost effective source of funds wherever possible 
a major source of funds consists of deposits obtained through the bank s retail branches in california 
the bank offers checking accounts  various money market accounts  regular passbook accounts and fixed interest rate certificates with varying maturities and retirement accounts 
deposit account terms vary by interest rate  minimum balance requirements and the duration of the account 
interest rates paid  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by the bank periodically  based on liquidity and financing requirements  rates paid by competitors  growth goals and federal regulations 
at december   such retail deposits were million or of total deposits 
the bank uses wholesale and broker originated deposits to supplement its retail deposits and  at december   wholesale deposits were million or of total deposits 
the bank solicits wholesale deposits by posting its interest rates on a national on line service  which advertises the bank s wholesale products to investors 
generally  most of the wholesale deposit account holders are institutional investors  commercial businesses or public sector entities 
brokered deposits are originated through major dealers specializing in such products 
included in wholesale deposits at december  are million of broker originated deposits

however  as a result of these shorter term deposits  the rates on these accounts may be more sensitive to movements in market interest rates  which may result in a higher cost of funds

through the bank  we may obtain advances from the fhlb collateralized by securities 
the fhlb functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for thrifts and certain other member financial institutions 
advances are made pursuant to several programs each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
limitations on the amount of advances are based generally on a fixed percentage of net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of an institution s credit worthiness

for uacc loans a percentage of each new loan  currently of net contract amount  is allocated to the allowance for loan losses 
this percentage is established by reviewing historical trends and levels of delinquencies and charge offs 
this percentage reflects the level of losses expected over the life of the loans 
periodically thereafter  management reviews the level of allowance for loan losses in light of any major changes in delinquencies and charge offs to assure the balance remains adequate to protect upfc from unexpected loss 
if this review reflects possible weakness  management will allocate an additional provision for loan loss  charged against current earnings  to maintain appropriate levels of allowance for loan losses 
for ipf loans  management establishes a level of allowance for loan losses based on recent trends in delinquencies and historical charge offs  currently of loans  that it feels is adequate for the risk in the portfolio 
each month an amount necessary to reach that level is charged against current earnings and added to allowance for loan losses

upfc s general policy is to discontinue accrual of interest on a mortgage loan when it is two payments or more delinquent and  accordingly  loans are placed on non accrual status generally when they are days delinquent 
a non mortgage loan is charged off or placed on nonaccrual status when it is delinquent for days or more 
when a loan is reclassified from accrual to nonaccrual status  all previously accrued interest is reversed 
interest income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received or the borrower s ability to make periodic interest and principal payments is in accordance with the loan terms  at which time the loan is returned to accrual status 
accounts which are deemed fully or partially uncollectible by management are generally fully reserved or charged off for the amount that exceeds the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the underlying collateral 
we do not generally modify  extend or rewrite loans

these allowances include specific reserves for identifiable impairments of individual loans and general valuation allowances for estimates of probable losses not specifically identified 
in addition  our allowance for loan losses is also increased by the allocation of acquisition discounts related to the purchase of automobile installment contracts 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors  including an assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio  prior loss experience  the levels and trends of non performing loans  the concentration of credit  current and prospective economic conditions and other factors 
upfc s management uses its best judgment in providing for possible loan losses and establishing allowances for loan losses 
however  the allowance is an estimate  which is inherently uncertain and depends on the outcome of future events 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to increase the allowance based upon their judgment of the information available to them at the time of their examination

the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of upfc are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
recent accounting developments in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria which intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet in order to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on upfc 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment 
as permitted by sfas no  upfc plans to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of the fiscal year upon adoption of sfas no  upfc will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments and or impairment adjustments 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
beginning on january   amortization of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives will cease 
it is not anticipated that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on upfc 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs would be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  upfc will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
two provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement will have no material impact on upfc 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for long lived assets to be held and used  sfas no 
retains the requirements of sfas no 
to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value 
further  sfas no 
eliminates the requirement to allocate goodwill to long lived assets to be tested for impairment  describes a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows  and establishes a primary assets approach to determine the cash flow estimation period 
for long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale eg  assets abandoned  exchanged or distributed to owners in a spin off  sfas no 
requires that such assets be considered held and used until disposed of 
further  an impairment loss should be recognized at the date an asset is exchanged for a similar productive asset or distributed to owners in a spin off if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  sfas no 
retains the requirement of sfas no 
to measure a long lived asset classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and to cease depreciation
