item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading item business risk factors 
overview from to  we derived substantially all of our revenues from the license of custom search and retrieval applications and consulting and other services related to such applications 
in  we began refining and enhancing our core technology to add functionality and facilitate incorporation of our technology in a variety of markets 
we now offer solutions and technology that address the business portal market 
the business portal market includes corporate portals used for sharing information within an enterprise  e commerce portals for online selling and market exchange portals for business to business activities 
business portals provide personalized information to employees  partners  customers and suppliers 
we expect that for the foreseeable future we will continue to derive the largest portion of our revenues from licensing our technology for enterprise and e commerce applications and business portal solutions 
during the quarterly periods ended august  to august  and february  to may   we experienced increased revenues on a quarterly basis 
in addition  during the thirteen consecutive quarterly periods ended may   we experienced twelve quarters of record revenues 
due to a delay in closing three large transactions  revenues for the quarter ended november  were lower than expected 
in fiscal years  and  we achieved net income of million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal year  as a result of the slowdown in worldwide economic conditions  we experienced a substantial decrease in revenue and net income  which totaled million and million  respectively 
while our goal is to increase revenue and continue to generate net income in future periods  we cannot assure you that our strategy will be successful  that we will experience the rate of revenue growth we experienced from august  to may  in future periods  or that we will continue to maintain positive cash flow or profitability 
our revenues are derived from license fees for our software products and fees for services complementary to our products  including software maintenance  consulting  technical support and training 
fees for services generally are charged separately from the license fees for our software products 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition 
we recognize maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support and product upgrades ratably over the term of the applicable maintenance agreement  which is typically twelve months 
generally  we receive payments for maintenance fees in advance and they are nonrefundable 
we recognize revenues for consulting and training generally when the services are performed 
for agreements with multiple elements  such as license  maintenance  training and consulting services  we allocate revenue to all undelivered elements usually maintenance and other services  based on objective evidence of its fair value  which is specific to us 
any remaining amount is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue when the conditions set forth above are met 
we recognize revenue allocated to maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and product updates ratably over the period of the maintenance contract  which is typically twelve months 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are non refundable 
for revenue allocated to training and consulting services  we recognize revenue as the related services are performed 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our revenues are derived from license fees for our software products and fees for services complementary to our products  including software maintenance  consulting and training 
we generally charge fees for services separately from the license fees for our software products 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
the aicpa and its software revenue recognition task force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
also  the securities and exchange commission sec has issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
delivery generally occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support and product upgrades ratably over the term of the applicable maintenance agreement  which is typically twelve months 
generally  we receive payments for maintenance fees in advance and they are nonrefundable 
we recognize revenues for consulting and training generally when the services are performed 
for agreements with multiple elements  such as license  maintenance  training and consulting services  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method and defer revenue from the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we base fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations on separate sales of these items to other customers or on contractually stipulated renewal rates 
we base fair value of services  such as training and consulting  upon separate sales of these services to other customers 
we allocate any remaining amount to the delivered elements and recognize it as revenue when the conditions set forth above are met 
sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns allowance in any accounting period 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of may   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for sales returns of million and allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
our income tax accounting process involves our recording the estimated future tax effects of 
table of contents temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we evaluate this tax asset at each balance sheet date to determine its realizability  considering  without limitation  currently enacted tax laws  expected future taxable income and origins of the specific components of the deferred tax asset 
if we determine that it is not fully realizable  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the asset balance to its realizable value through a charge to income tax expense 
determining whether we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carryforward requires that we estimate future taxable income and make judgments regarding the timing of future tax obligations 
actual taxable income could differ from our estimates 
as of may   we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the majority of our tax asset through expected future taxable profits  but believe that it is more probable than not that we will not be able to recover any benefits from net operating loss carryforwards originating from deductions for the exercise and or disposition of stock options in recent periods 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance related to this component of the deferred tax asset 
the net operating loss carryforwards originating from deductions for the exercise and or disposition of stock options and the related valuation allowance has been recorded against additional paid in capital and did not affect net income for the period 
if we conclude that other components of the deferred tax asset require a valuation allowance in the future  the effect on income tax expense could be material

table of contents years ended may   and revenues total revenues percent percent change change dollars in millions total revenues the decrease in total revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to the impact of the slowdown in worldwide economic conditions resulting in customers canceling or delaying orders  due to their downsizing capital spending  partly offset by increased service and other revenue derived from our installed base 
the decrease was the result of both a decrease in the total number of customer transactions and a reduction in the average revenue per transaction 
the increase in total revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was due primarily to increased revenues from sales of our business portal solutions and our enterprise application businesses and  to a lesser extent  an increase in maintenance and consulting revenues

the increase in costs of software products in absolute dollars and as a percentage of software revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily attributable to increasing costs of third party software components and costs associated with the introduction of our portal suite of products 
in fiscal years  and  we did not capitalize any software development costs since such costs were not material 
costs of service and other percent percent change change dollars in millions costs of service and other percentage of service and other revenues costs of service and other consists of costs incurred in providing consulting services  customer training  telephone support and product upgrades to customers 
significant cost components include personnel related and third party contractor costs  facilities costs  travel expenses associated with training and consulting implementation services and depreciation expense

our future research and development expenses may vary as a percentage of total revenues

we anticipate that we will continue to make significant investments in marketing and sales and that our quarterly marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars over our quarter ended may  spending levels 
the decrease in marketing and sales expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily related to a reduction in sales personnel resulting from our workforce restructuring in the quarter ended november   to a decrease in sales commissions resulting from the decrease in software product revenues and to decreased spending on all marketing programs 
the increase in marketing and sales expenses as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was principally related to decreased total revenues for the period 
the increase in marketing and sales expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily related to the expansion of our marketing and sales organizations  to higher commission expenses relating to the increase in total revenues  to the development of our sales distribution channels in the united states and europe  and to outbound marketing activities associated with the branding and advertising of our company

other income  net percent percent change change dollars in millions other income  net percentage of total revenues other income consists primarily of interest income and realized gains from our investments in marketable securities 
the decrease in other income in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to decreasing overall yields on our portfolio of marketable securities caused by the decreasing interest rate environment partially offset by higher cash balances when compared with the prior year

the tax effect of this difference is reported as deferred income taxes 
during the year ended may   we assessed the qualification of our research and development expenses for state and federal research and development tax credits 
we expect the tax savings for fiscal due to research and development tax credits to result in a marginally lower effective tax rate and accordingly applied an effective tax rate of to the result of our year ended may  we will continually reassess the impact of our research and development expenses on our effective tax rate in future periods

recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no

this standard eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july   and applies to all business combinations accounted for under the purchase method that are completed after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard eliminates the amortization of goodwill and requires goodwill to be reviewed at least annually for impairment  the useful lives of previously recognized intangible assets to be reassessed and the remaining amortization periods to be adjusted accordingly 
this standard is effective for our fiscal year beginning on june  we do not expect the implementation of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations

accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no  however it retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
develops a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired assets and consequently amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a division of a business 
additionally  sfas no 
expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under eitf issue no 
 an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
in sfas  the board acknowledges that an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability and requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
it also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability 
sfas will be 
table of contents effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect an impact on our financial position and results of operations from the adoption of sfas related party transactions regent pacific management corporation  a management services firm of which mr

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of may   approximately of our portfolio matures in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than three years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of may  fy fy fy total fair value in thousands cash equivalents average interest rate short term investments average interest rate long term investments average interest rates foreign currency risk 
we transact business in various foreign currencies  including the euro  the british pound  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the swedish krona  the south african rand  the mexican peso  the brazilian real and the singaporean dollar 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain sales contracts denominated in foreign currency 
under this program  fluctuations in foreign currencies during the period from the signing of the contract until payment are partially offset by realized gains and losses on the hedging instruments 
the goal of this hedging program is to lock in exchange rates on our sales contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the notional amount of hedged contracts and the estimated fair value are not material
