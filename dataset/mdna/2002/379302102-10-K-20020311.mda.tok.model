critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used to establish common area maintenance  real estate tax and insurance tenant accounts receivable  and accounts receivable reserves 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the company s estimate of the amounts of the recorded accounts receivable at the balance sheet date that will not be realized from cash receipts in subsequent periods 
if the financial condition of the company s tenants deteriorates as a result of operating difficulties or tenants operating under bankruptcy protection  additional provisions may be required 
the company maintains a diverse portfolio of real estate assets 
the portfolio holdings have increased as a result of both acquisitions and the development of new properties and have been reduced by selected sales of assets 
the amounts to be capitalized as a result of acquisition and developments and the periods over which the assets are depreciated or amortized are determined based on the application of accounting standards that may require estimates as to fair value and the allocation of various costs to the individual assets 
the sale of real estate assets may also involve the application of judgements in determining whether the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer and that a sale has been completed for purposes of recognizing a gain on the sale 
although the company has from time to time entered into negotiations or contracts that cover the sale of individual assets  the assets sales have not been part of a plan to dispose of specific holdings 
the determination of whether specific assets are classified as held for sale or maintained as operating assets which continue to be depreciated reflects management s judgement and future intent with respect to the properties 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its investments in real estate assets to be held and used and records an impairment charge when there is an indicator of impairment and the undiscounted projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount for a particular property 
a decline in operating results or adverse market conditions for a particular property could result in the inability to fully recover the carrying amount of the investment and therefore require an impairment charge in the future 
the company s investment in certain of its real estate holdings is in the form of joint ventures in which the company has a or less ownership interest 
the company provides leasing  development  legal and construction and property management services to the joint ventures 
these joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the determination as to whether these holdings are included in the financial statements as a consolidated subsidiary or reflected under the equity method of accounting requires judgement as to the company s level of control and or influence with respect to significant decisions  consideration of the debt structure of the joint venture and the participants equity contribution 
the company has used interest rate cap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure and interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors  and all contracts are intended to be effective as hedges of specific interest rate risk exposures 
in connection with the determination of the effectiveness of these hedges and the recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on these contracts  the company computes the fair value of the contracts at each balance sheet date 
to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  the company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
information technology the company has successfully completed the first phase of its erp implementation 
this phase focused on oracle e business suite of financial applications 
the company continues to work with oracle corporation to develop a comprehensive web based property management solution for reits 
the property manager software will be tested by our users during the second half of and is expected to be implemented in the company has standardized on dell for its intel based servers  desktops and laptops 
all the intel based servers have been upgraded with respect to hardware and software 
the company has also entered into a corporate license agreement with novell for all its server and collaboration software and a volume license agreement with microsoft for all its desktop application software 
these agreements have helped streamline our it processes with standardization across the company and allow the company to manage and enforce software license compliance 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years and has had a minimal impact on the company s properties 
many tenants leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents in the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
substantially all of the leases  other than those for anchors  require the tenants to pay a proportionate share of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
inflation may  however  have a negative impact on some of the company s other operating items 
interest expense and general and administrative expenses may be adversely affected by inflation as these specified costs could increase at a rate higher than rents 
also  for tenant leases with stated rent increases  inflation may have a negative effect as the stated rent increases in these leases could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company uses interest rate protection agreements to manage interest rate risks associated with long term  floating rate debt 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s debt  after giving effect to interest rate swap agreements  bore interest at fixed rates with weighted average maturity of years and years  respectively  and weighted average interest rates of approximately and  respectively 
the remainder of the company s debt bears interest at variable rates with weighted average interest rates of approximately and  at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the fair value of the company s debt excluding its credit facility was  million and million  respectively  compared to its carrying amounts of  million and million  respectively 
the company s combined future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  primarily libor 
based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december  and  a basis points increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by million and million  respectively  and decrease the fair value of debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
a basis points decrease in the market rates of interest would increase future earnings and cash flows by million and million  respectively  and increase the fair value of debt by approximately million and million  respectively
