general real estate markets are cyclical in nature and highly sensitive to changes in national  regional and international economic conditions  including  among other factors  levels of employment and discretionary disposable income  consumer confidence  available financing and interest rates 
while a downturn in the economy in general or in the market for real estate could have a material adverse effect on the company  and there are no assurances that a continuation or decline in existing conditions will not have a material adverse effect  the company believes that current general economic conditions have not materially impacted the company s financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended march  the company recognizes revenue on residential land and timeshare interest sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash  the refund or rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and the company has completed substantially all of its obligations with respect to any development relating to the real estate sold 
in cases where all development has not been completed  the company recognizes income in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method of income recognition  income is recognized as work progresses 
measures of progress are based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to expected total costs 
the company has been dedicating greater resources to more capital intensive residential land and timeshare projects 
as development on more of these larger projects is begun  to the extent possible  and based on the company s strategy to pre sell projects when minimal development has been completed  the amount of income deferred under the percentage of completion method of accounting may increase significantly 
costs associated with the acquisition and development of timeshare resorts and residential land properties  including carrying costs such as interest and taxes  are capitalized as inventory and are allocated to cost of real estate sold as the respective revenues are recognized 
the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its gross revenues and net earnings 
this seasonality may cause significant fluctuations in the quarterly operating results of the company  with the majority of the company s gross revenues and net earnings historically occurring in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year 
as the company s timeshare revenues grow as a percentage of total revenues  the company believes that the fluctuations in revenues due to seasonality may be mitigated in part 
in addition  other material fluctuations in operating results may occur due to the timing of development and the company s use of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
management expects that the company will continue to invest in projects that will require substantial development with significant capital requirements 
there can be no assurances that historical seasonal trends in quarterly revenues and earnings will continue or be mitigated by the company s efforts 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on its revenues and results of operations during any of the three years ended march   other than to the extent that the company continually challenges and has historically increased the sales prices of its timeshare interests annually 
based on prior history  the company does not expect that inflation will have a material impact on the company s revenues or results of operations in the foreseeable future  although there is no assurance that the company will be able to continue to increase prices 
to the extent inflationary trends affect short term interest rates  a portion of the company s debt service costs may be affected as well as the interest rate the company charges on its new receivables from its customers 
the company believes that the terrorist attacks on september  in the united states and subsequent events that have decreased the amount of vacation air travel by americans have not  to date  had a material adverse impact on the company s sales in its domestic sales offices 
with the exception of la cabana  guests at the company s bluegreen vacation club destination resorts more typically drive  rather than fly  to these resorts due to the accessibility of the resorts 
while there was an adverse impact on sales at la cabana during certain months in the post september th period  based on current conditions the company does not believe that there will be a long term adverse impact on its sales in aruba from decreased air travel  partially due to the fact that a significant portion of aruba s tourist traffic comes from south america 
there can be no assurances  however  that a long term decrease in air travel or increase in anxiety regarding actual or possible future terrorist attacks or other world events would not have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations in some future period 
the company s real estate operations are managed under two divisions 
the resorts division manages the company s timeshare operations and the residential land and golf division acquires large tracts of real estate  which are subdivided  improved in some cases to include a golf course on the property and sold  typically on a retail basis as home sites 
inventory is carried at the lower of cost  including costs of improvements and amenities incurred subsequent to acquisition  or fair value  net of costs to dispose 
a portion of the company s revenues historically has been and  although no assurances can be given  is expected to continue to be comprised of gains on sales of loans 
the gains are recorded on the company s consolidated income statement and the related retained interests in the portfolios are recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale 
the amount of gains and the fair value of the retained interests recorded are based in part on management s estimates of future prepayment  default and loss severity rates and other considerations in light of then current conditions 
if actual prepayments with respect to loans occur more quickly than was projected at the time such loans were sold  as can occur when interest rates decline  interest would be less than expected and may cause a decline in the fair value of the retained interests and a charge to earnings currently 
if actual defaults or other factors discussed above with respect to loans sold are greater than estimated  charge offs would exceed previously estimated amounts and may cause a decline in the fair value of the retained interests and a charge to earnings currently 
there can be no assurances that the carrying value of the company s retained interests in notes receivable sold will be fully realized or that future loan sales will be consummated or  if consummated  result in gains 
declines in the fair value of the retained interests that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those that relate to the recognition of revenue  including recognition under the percentage of completion method of accounting  the company s reserve for loan losses  the valuation of retained interests in notes receivable sold and the related gains on sales of notes receivable  the recovery of the carrying value of real estate inventories  intangible assets and other assets  and the estimate of contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from management s estimates  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate  the company recognizes revenue on retail land sales and sales of timeshare interests when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash  the legal rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and the company has completed substantially all of its obligations with respect to any development related to the real estate sold 
in cases where all development has not been completed  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
should the company s estimates regarding the collectibility of its receivables change adversely or the company s estimates of the total anticipated cost of its timeshare and residential land and golf projects increase  the company s results of operations could be adversely impacted 
o the company considers many factors when establishing and evaluating the adequacy of its reserve for loan losses 
these factors include recent and historical default rates  current delinquency rates  contractual payment terms  loss severity rates along with present and expected economic conditions 
the company examines these factors and adjusts its reserve for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
should the company s estimates of these and other pertinent factors change  the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity position could be adversely affected 
o when the company sells notes receivables either pursuant to its timeshare receivables purchase facilities or  in the case of land mortgages receivable  private placement remics  it retains subordinated tranches  rights to excess interest spread  servicing rights and in some cases a cash reserve account  all of which are retained interests in the sold notes receivable 
gain or loss on sale of the receivables depends in part on the allocation of the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
the company initially and periodically estimates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of the key assumptions prepayment rates  loss severity rates  default rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
should the company s estimates of these key assumptions change  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
o the company periodically evaluates the recovery of the carrying amount of individual resort and residential land properties under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets for long lived assets to be disposed of 
factors that the company considers in making this evaluation include the estimated remaining life of project sales for each project based on current retail prices and the estimated costs to complete each project 
should the company s estimates of these factors change  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
o the company periodically evaluates the recovery of the carrying amount of goodwill and other long lived assets by determining if any impairment indicators are present 
these indicators include duplication of resources resulting from acquisitions  income derived from businesses acquired  the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the entity over the remaining amortization period  the recoverability of the long lived assets over their estimated lives and other factors 
should the company s estimates of these factors change and indicators of impairment prove to be present  the company may be required to write down its goodwill or other long lived assets in some future period  which may have a material adverse impact on the results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for the company s fiscal year under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas no 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal beginning april  
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations in thousands residential resorts land and golf total year ended march  sales    cost of sales    gross profit    other resort and golf operations revenues    cost of resort and golf operations    field selling  general and administrative expenses    field operating profit    year ended april  sales    cost of sales    gross profit    other resort and golf operations revenues    cost of resort and golf operations    field selling  general and administrative expenses    field operating profit    year ended april  sales    cost of sales    gross profit    other resort and golf operations revenues    cost of resort and golf operations    field selling  general and administrative expenses    field operating profit    cost of sales represents the cost of inventory including the cost of improvements  amenities and in certain cases previously capitalized interest and real estate taxes 
general and administrative expenses attributable to corporate overhead have been excluded from the tables 
corporate general and administrative expenses totaled million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sales and field operations consolidated sales were million for the year ended march  fiscal  million for the year ended april  fiscal and million for the year ended april  fiscal  representing an increase of from fiscal to fiscal and an increase of from fiscal to fiscal resorts division during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  sales of timeshare interests contributed million or  million or and million or  respectively  of the company s total consolidated sales 
the following table sets forth certain information for sales of timeshare interests for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting 
years ended  march  april  april  number of timeshare sale transactions    average sales price per transaction    gross margin the million increase in resorts division sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to the million increase in sales at the company s owned big cedar wilderness club  as this resort had just commenced sales in fiscal and was in the start up phase 
this increase was partially offset by the closure of the offsite sales office serving the cleveland  ohio market in may  due to low profitability 
the cleveland sales office generated million in sales prior to its closure in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the increase in timeshare sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to the fiscal opening of the company s offsite sales office serving the detroit  michigan market 
the detroit sales office generated timeshare sales of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in addition  the company s mountainloft resort sales office in gatlinburg  tennessee generated million more timeshare sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to a increase in prospective buyers touring the property combined with a point increase in the sales office s prospect to tour conversion percentage 
also  the company s lodge alley inn sales office in charleston  south carolina generated million more sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to a increase in prospective buyers touring the property combined with a point increase in the sales office s prospect to tour conversion percentage 
the falls village resort in branson  missouri  generated million more sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to a increase in prospective buyers touring the property combined with a point increase in the sales office s prospect to tour conversion percentage 
the company believes these increases are attributed to the implementation of an improved sales process relative to the bluegreen vacation club product and more effective marketing programs 
finally  the opening of the company s owned big cedar wilderness club resort adjacent to the big cedar lodge in ridgedale  missouri  contributed million to the overall increase in timeshare sales during fiscal gross profit from other resort services increased million or to million from  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to million in increased profits related to management and other fee income earned for services provided to bluegreen vacation club members  due to an increase in members from  to  members at april  and march   respectively 
as the bluegreen vacation club member base increases  the company anticipates increased gross profits from the related management fees  although there can be no assurances that the member base will increase or that such increased management fees will be realized 
this increase was partially offset by additional costs incurred in connection with the expansion of the resorts division s customer service area 
gross profit from other resort services decreased million to  from million during fiscal as compared to fiscal  respectively 
the company added a resort customer service department in fiscal  at a cost of over  in addition  profits from the company s resort rental brokerage services decreased approximately  the reduction in field selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of timeshare sales to from during fiscal as compared to fiscal  respectively  was primarily due to the company s focused efforts on increasing tour flow from our inhouse  referral and owner marketing programs as well as a new compensation plan which tied the company s regional sales and marketing directors compensation to profitability 
in addition  the centralization of certain marketing functions contributed to the decrease in costs 
another factor in the decrease of field selling  general and administrative expenses was a new  standardized commissions plan implemented in fiscal as well as the centralization of commission processing and monitoring at the company s corporate headquarters  which resulted in a decrease in administrative personnel 
field selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is an important indicator of the performance of the resorts division and the company as a whole 
no assurances can be given that this positive trend will continue or that field selling  general and administrative expenses will not increase as a percentage of sales in future periods 
residential land and golf division during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  residential land and golf sales contributed million or  million or and million or  respectively  of the company s total consolidated sales 
the table set forth below outlines the number of home sites sold and the average sales price per home site for the residential land and golf division for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting and excluding sales of bulk parcels 
years ended  march  april  april  number of home sites sold    average sales price per home site    gross margin residential land and golf division sales increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to million of increased sales at the preserve at jordan lake  a golf course community located near raleigh durham  north carolina 
the preserve at jordan lake had just commenced sales and development during fiscal  and therefore had a significant portion of its sales during this start up year deferred under percentage of completion accounting 
this increase was partially offset by an million decrease in sales in the company s arizona region due to the two main projects in this region being substantially sold out in fiscal the company still intends to consider acquiring additional residential land projects in the arizona market  although no assurances can be given that the company will acquire additional inventory in that area 
the remaining offsetting decrease was due to a million sale of a bulk tract of land in fiscal by the company  with no such corresponding sale in fiscal residential land and golf division sales decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to decreases in available inventories due  in part  to a strategic decision not to replace certain properties which either sold out in fiscal or which are approaching sell out in areas of the country where the company has chosen to exit 
these areas include florida  tennessee  wisconsin and new mexico 
this factor resulted in fewer lot sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal also  included in the fiscal results of operations is a one time  bulk sale of land and mineral rights in colorado to a developer of oil and gas rights  which contributed approximately million and million to residential land and golf division sales and field operating profit  respectively 
the company intends to primarily focus its residential land golf division resources on developing new golf communities  continuing to support its successful regions in texas and exploring continued expansion into the california market 
during fiscal  the company s golf communities and texas regions comprised approximately and  respectively  of the company s total residential land and golf sales 
in december  the company acquired approximately  acres near san diego  california  representing the company s first acquisition in the california market 
this property was acquired for million in cash  including acquisition costs 
sales at the project are currently delayed while the company obtains necessary entitlements on the land 
the company currently expects that this project will commence sales during fiscal  although there can be no assurances 
the decrease in gross margin during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to million in impairment charges taken on the company s crystal cove tm project in tennessee 
additional development expenditures required for road and utility work at the project exceeded the company s original estimates 
the company believes that this charge is adequate to reduce the carrying value of this project its fair value less estimated selling costs  however there can be no assurances that further charges will not be required 
the decrease in gross margin during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the impact of the sale of mineral rights and related land in colorado to a developer of oil and gas rights  which accounted for million of sales and million in gross profit in fiscal excluding this one time transaction  residential land and golf division gross margins would have been during fiscal in addition  gross margins were adversely impacted by unanticipated additional roadwork  the costs of which are being directly expensed to cost of sales  at the crystal cove project 
the company s investment committee approves all property acquisitions 
in order to be approved for purchase by the investment committee  all residential land and golf as well as resort properties are expected to achieve certain minimum economics including a minimum gross margin 
no assurances can be given that such minimum economics will be achieved 
the gross loss from golf operations decreased  or during fiscal as compared to fiscal and  or during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to decreased losses from the operations at carolina national  as the operation continues to mature 
interest income interest income was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company s interest income is earned from its notes receivable  retained interests in notes receivable sold including remic transactions and cash and cash equivalents 
the decrease in interest income during fiscal was due to due to lower average cash balances on hand  lower interest rates on cash balances and residential land and golf division mortgages held and lower timeshare notes receivables held due to increased sales of timeshare notes receivable during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in interest income during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the average notes receivable balance during fiscal  as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the fact that the company s timeshare receivables purchase facility see liquidity and capital resources was not executed as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal  and therefore the company did not sell any receivables during the first half of fiscal  thus generating more interest income from higher average notes receivable balances 
gain on sale of notes receivable in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company recognized million  million and million in gains  respectively  on the sale of timeshare notes receivable pursuant to timeshare receivables purchase facilities in place during the respective periods the current timeshare receivables purchase facility is more fully described below under credit facilities for timeshare receivables and inventories 
the amount of gain increased in fiscal and fiscal commensurate with the increase in the principal amount of notes receivable sold million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
another factor that increased the gain on sale of theses receivables during fiscal as compared to fiscal was the decrease in commercial paper rates during the respective periods 
the return earned by the parties who purchased these fixed rate approximately receivables is based on variable commercial paper rates  so as interest rates decrease the available interest spread increases which in turn increases the value of the company s retained interest in the receivable pools sold and hence increases the company s gain on sale 
corporate general and administrative expenses for a discussion of field selling  general and administrative expenses  please see sales and field operations  above 
the company s corporate general and administrative g a expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred to administer the various support functions at the company s corporate headquarters  including accounting  human resources  information technology  mergers and acquisitions  mortgage servicing  treasury  legal  etc

the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased depreciation expense on fixed assets and increased outside legal fees in the normal course of business 
interest expense interest expense totaled million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was due to lower outstanding balances on the company s acquisition and development loans borrowed in prior years and lower interest rates on variable rate facilities 
the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to increased interest expense from the hypothecation of receivables during the first half of fiscal pending the first sale of timeshare receivables under the company s timeshare receivables purchase facility entered into during september see liquidity and capital resources 
the majority of this hypothecation interest expense was offset by increased interest income earned on the timeshare receivables held

the decrease in the provision during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to increased  non recourse sales of notes receivable pursuant to the company s timeshare receivables purchase facility during fiscal as compared to fiscal see liquidity and capital resources 
other notes receivable at march   primarily consists of a loan to the property owners association that is responsible for the maintenance of la cabana  casa grande cooperative association i see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

the company reports cash flows from borrowings collateralized by notes receivable and sales of notes receivable as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the majority of the company s sales for the resorts division result in the origination of notes receivable from its customers

credit facilities for timeshare receivables and inventories the company s ability to sell and or borrow against its notes receivable from timeshare buyers is a critical factor in the company s continued liquidity 
the timeshare business involves making sales of a product pursuant to which a financed buyer is only required to pay of the purchase in cash up front  yet selling  marketing and administrative expenses are primarily cash expenses and which  in the company s case for the period  approximated of sales 
accordingly  having facilities for the sale and hypothecation of these timeshare receivables is critical to meet the company s short and long term cash needs 
in june  the company executed agreements for the purchase facility with csfb acting as the initial purchaser 
in april  ing acquired and assumed csfb s rights  obligations and commitments as initial purchaser in the purchase facility by purchasing the outstanding principal balance under the facility of million from csfb

ing may attempt to securitize and sell the receivable portfolio that it purchased from csfb along with additional receivables purchased from the company prior to such securitization and sale

the company seeks new timeshare receivable purchase facilities to replace expiring facilities 
the company is currently discussing terms for a potential new timeshare receivable purchase facility with a financial institution 
factors which could adversely impact the company s ability to obtain new or additional timeshare receivable purchase facilities include  but are not limited to  a downturn in general economic conditions  negative trends in the commercial paper or libor markets  increases in interest rates  a decrease in the number of financial institutions willing to engage in such facilities in the timeshare area  and a deterioration in the company s performance generally and the performance of the company s timeshare notes receivable  specifically increased delinquency  default and loss severity rates 
there can be no assurances that the company will obtain a new purchase facility to replace the purchase facility when it is completed or expires 
as indicated above  the company s inability to sell timeshare receivables under a current or future facility could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity and operations 
the company had a timeshare receivables warehouse loan facility the warehouse facility  which expired on april   with heller financial  inc  a financial institution that was subsequently acquired by general electric capital real estate ge 
loans under the warehouse facility bear interest at libor plus 
the warehouse facility had detailed requirements with respect to the eligibility of receivables for inclusion and other conditions to funding 
the borrowing base under the warehouse facility was of the outstanding principal balance of eligible notes arising from the sale of timeshare interests except for eligible notes generated by bluegreen properties nv tm  for which the borrowing base was 
the warehouse facility includes affirmative  negative and financial covenants and events of default 
during fiscal  the company borrowed an aggregate million under the warehouse facility  of which the company repaid an aggregate million by using cash generated from principal and interest payments on the underlying loans and proceeds from the sale of the underlying receivables under a previous timeshare receivables purchase facility with the same financial institution 
the remaining balance of the warehouse facility was due in april   however ge has represented to the company that the remaining balance is not considered to be in default pending ge s approval of a new combined warehouse and purchase facility 
the remaining balance on the warehouse facility continues to be repaid as principal and interest payments are collected on the timeshare notes receivable 
as of march   there was million outstanding under the warehouse facility 
there can be no assurances that ge will approve the increase and extension of the warehouse facility or that ge will not declare the warehouse facility to be in default and due and payable immediately 
the company believes that in the event that ge requires the warehouse facility to be repaid  the revolving credit facility with foothill capital corporation foothill  discussed below  or the purchase facility could be utilized to satisfy this obligation in the normal course of business

the company is currently in the process of closing a million receivables warehouse facility and a million acquisition and development facility for the resorts division with a financial institution 
there can be no assurances that these facilities will close as anticipated

the company is currently in the process of closing a million acquisition and development facility for the residential land and golf division with a financial institution 
there can be no assurances that this facility will close as anticipated 
over the past three years  the company has received approximately to of its land sales proceeds in cash 
accordingly  in recent years the company has reduced the borrowing capacity under credit agreements secured by land receivables 
the company attributes the significant volume of cash sales to an increased willingness on the part of certain local banks to extend more direct customer home site financing 
no assurances can be given that local banks will continue to provide such customer financing 
historically  the company has funded development for road and utility construction  amenities  surveys and engineering fees from internal operations and has financed the acquisition of residential land and golf properties through seller  bank or financial institution loans 
terms for repayment under these loans typically call for interest to be paid monthly and principal to be repaid through home site releases 
the release price is usually defined as a pre determined percentage of the gross selling price typically to of the home sites in the subdivision 
in addition  the agreements generally call for minimum cumulative annual amortization 
when the company provides financing for its customers and therefore the release price is not available in cash at closing to repay the lender  it is required to pay the creditor with cash derived from other operating activities  principally from cash sales or the pledge of receivables originated from earlier property sales 
other credit facility the company has a million unsecured line of credit with first union national bank 
amounts borrowed under the line bear interest at libor plus 
interest is due monthly and all principal amounts are due on december  the company is only allowed to borrow under the line of credit in amounts less than the remaining availability under its current  active timeshare receivables purchase facility plus availability under certain receivable warehouse facilities  less any outstanding letters of credit 
the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants and conditions typical of arrangements of this type 
as of march   there was no amount outstanding under the line  nor have there been any borrowings under the line through june  this line of credit is an important source of short term liquidity for the company  as it allows the company to fund through its timeshare receivables purchase facility less frequently than it otherwise would 
summary the company intends to continue to pursue a growth oriented strategy  particularly with respect to its resorts division 
in connection with this strategy  the company may from time to time acquire  among other things  additional resort properties and completed timeshare interests  land upon which additional resorts may be built  management contracts  loan portfolios of timeshare interest mortgages  portfolios which include properties or assets which may be integrated into the company s operations  interests in joint ventures  and operating companies providing or possessing management  sales  marketing  development  administration and or other expertise with respect to the company s operations in the timeshare industry 
in addition  the company intends to continue to focus the residential land and golf division on larger  more capital intensive projects particularly in those regions where the company believes the market for its products is strongest  such as new golf communities in the southeast and other areas and continued growth in the company s successful regions in texas 
the company s material commitments for capital resources as of march   included the required payments due on it s receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes and debentures payable  commitments to complete its timeshare and residential land projects based on its sales contracts with customers and commitments under noncancelable operating leases 
the following table summarizes the contractual minimum principal payments required on all of the company s outstanding debt including its receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes and debentures payable and its noncancelable operating leases as of march  by period due in thousands payments due by period contractual less than after obligations total year years years years receivable backed notes payable    lines of credit and notes payable     senior secured notes payable   convertible subordinated notes payable to related parties   convertible subordinated debentures     noncancelable operating leases    total contractual obligations      includes unamortized discount on notes payable of approximately  the company intends to use cash flow from operations  including cash received from the sale of timeshare notes receivable  and cash received from new borrowings under existing or future debt facilities in order to satisfy the above principal payments 
while the company believes that it will be able to meet all required debt payments when due  there can be no assurances 
the company estimates that the total cash required to complete resort buildings in which sales have occurred and resort amenities and other common costs in projects in which sales have occurred as of march  is approximately million 
the company estimates that the total cash required to complete its residential land projects in which sales have occurred as of march  is approximately million 
these amounts assume that the company is not obligated to develop any building  project or amenity in which a commitment has not been made through a sales contract to a customer 
the company plans to fund these expenditures over the next five years primarily with available capacity on existing or proposed credit facilities and cash generated from operations 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to obtain the financing or generate the cash from operations necessary to complete the foregoing plans or that actual costs will not exceed those estimated 
the company believes that its existing cash  anticipated cash generated from operations  anticipated future permitted borrowings under existing or proposed credit facilities and anticipated future sales of notes receivable under the timeshare receivables purchase facility or any replacement facility will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company will be required to renew or replace credit facilities that will expire or were terminated by the company in fiscal and fiscal the company will  in the future  also require additional credit facilities or issuances of other corporate debt or equity securities in connection with acquisitions or otherwise 
any debt incurred or issued by the company may be secured or unsecured  bear fixed or variable rate interest and may be subject to such terms as the lender may require and management deems prudent 
there can be no assurances that the credit facilities or receivables purchase facilities which have expired  which are scheduled to expire or which have been terminated in the near term will be renewed or replaced or that sufficient funds will be available from operations or under existing  proposed or future revolving credit or other borrowing arrangements or receivables purchase facilities to meet the company s cash needs  including  without limitation  its debt service obligations 
the company s credit facilities  indentures  receivables purchase facilities and other outstanding debt instruments include customary conditions to funding  eligibility requirements for collateral  cross default and other acceleration provisions  certain financial and other affirmative and negative covenants  including  among others  limits on the incurrence of indebtedness  limits on the repurchase of securities  payment of dividends  investments in joint ventures and other restricted payments  the incurrence of liens  transactions with affiliates  covenants concerning net worth  fixed charge coverage requirements  debt to equity ratios and events of default or termination 
no assurances can be given that such covenants will not limit the company s ability to raise funds  satisfy or refinance its obligations or otherwise adversely affect the company s operations 
in addition  the company s future operating performance and ability to meet its financial obligations will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which will be beyond the company s control 
the company s ability to service or to refinance its indebtedness or to obtain additional financing including its ability to consummate future notes receivable securitizations depends  among other things  on its future performance  which is subject to a number of factors  including the company s business  results of operations  leverage  financial condition and business prospects  the performance of its receivables  prevailing interest rates  general economic conditions and perceptions about the residential land and timeshare industries  some of which are beyond the company s control 
if the company s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations and support its operation  the company  among other consequences  may be forced to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures  reduce its financing of sales  sell assets  obtain additional equity capital or refinance or restructure its debt 
the company cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity on attractive terms  or at all 
in addition  many of our obligations under our debt arrangements contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions 
as a result  if we default under one debt arrangement  other lenders might be able to declare amounts due under their arrangements  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the company s level of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on its operations  including the following i the company has significant cash requirements to service debt  reducing funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increasing the company s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  ii the company s leveraged position increases its vulnerability to competitive pressures  iii the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in the indentures  the credit agreements and other agreements relating to the company s indebtedness will require the company to meet certain financial tests and will restrict its ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  dispose of assets  make investments or pay cash dividends on  or repurchase  preferred or common stock  and iv funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes may be limited 
certain of the company s competitors operate on a less leveraged basis and have greater operating and financial flexibility than the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the company s total revenues and net assets denominated in a currency other than us dollars during fiscal were less than of consolidated revenues and consolidated assets  respectively 
sales generated and long term debt incurred to date by bluegreen properties  nv  the company s subsidiary in aruba  are transacted in us dollars 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have not historically been significant to the company s operations or net assets 
interest rate risk the company sold million  million and million of fixed rate timeshare notes receivable during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  under the purchase facility and previous timeshare receivable purchase facilities see credit facilities for timeshare receivables and inventories and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the gain on sale recognized by the company is based upon variable interest rates at the time of sale including the prevailing weighted average term treasury rate  commercial paper rates or libor rates depending on the purchase facility in effect and many other factors including  but not limited to the weighted average coupon rate and remaining contractual life of the loans sold  and assumptions regarding the constant prepayment rate  loss severity and annual default rates 
the company also retains residual interests in pools of fixed and variable rate land notes receivable sold in private placement remic transactions 
the company believes that it has used conservative assumptions in valuing the residual interests retained in the timeshare and land notes sold through the purchase facility and remic transactions  respectively  and that such assumptions should mitigate the impact of a hypothetical one percentage point interest rate change on these valuations 
there can be no assurances that the assumptions will prove to be conservative 
as of march   the company had fixed interest rate debt of approximately million and floating interest rate debt of approximately million 
in addition  the company s notes receivable from timeshare and residential land and golf customers were comprised of million of fixed rate loans and million of notes bearing floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates are based either upon the prevailing prime or three month libor interest rates 
for floating rate financial instruments  interest rate changes do not generally affect the market value of debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate financial instruments  interest rate changes do affect the market value of debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the prevailing prime or libor rates  as applicable  would decrease after tax earnings of the company by approximately  per year  based on the impact of increased interest income on variable rate residential land and golf notes receivable and cash and cash equivalents offset by the increased interest expense on variable rate debt 
a similar change in the interest rate would decrease the total fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  excluding the debentures and the notes  by a nominal amount 
the fact that the debentures are publicly traded and convertible into the company s common stock makes it impractical to estimate the effect of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the fair value of the debentures 
in addition  the fact that the notes see note offering are publicly traded in the over the counter market makes it impractical to estimate the effect of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the fair value of the notes 
due to the non interest related factors involved in determining the fair value of these publicly traded securities  their fair values have historically demonstrated increased  decreased or at times contrary relationships to changes in interest rates as compared to other types of fixed rate debt securities 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of such a change  management may likely take actions to mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
