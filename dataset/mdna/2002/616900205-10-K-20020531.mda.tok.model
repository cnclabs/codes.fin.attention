there is no tax effect of the loss 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to changes in estimated alternative minimum tax payments 
liquidity and capital resources 
the company  like others in the restaurant industry  operates on minimal working capital and relies on cash flow from operations  debt borrowings and lease financing for the construction and refurbishment of restaurant properties and repayment of debt 
cash flow activity for fiscal  and is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
capital expenditures for fiscal were  substantially all of which related to the addition of concepts to restaurants  the addition of equipment necessary for new products and home office and restaurant computer equipment 
in fiscal the company made principal payments on long term debt of  and on capital lease obligations of  the quick service restaurant operations of the company have historically provided sufficient cash flow to service the company s debt  refurbish and upgrade restaurant properties and cover administrative overhead 
management believes that operating cash flow will provide sufficient capital to continue to operate and maintain the kfc  taco bell and n restaurants  service the company s debt and support required corporate expenses 
certain of the company s debt arrangements require the maintenance of a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of to regarding all of its mortgage loans and individual restaurant coverage ratios of to morgan s foods  inc 
part ii cont d on certain of its loans 
the company was in compliance with the consolidated ratio of to applicable to its loans 
the company was not in compliance with the to unit level ratio on certain of its restaurants 
the company has obtained waivers of these violations from the applicable lender 
management expects to be in compliance with all financial covenants in future periods  or to obtain amendments or waivers of any covenants 
the company is currently not in full compliance with the american stock exchange financial condition guidelines for continued listing 
specifically  the guidelines indicate that any company with shareholders equity less than  and losses in of its last fiscal years may be considered for delisting 
this condition has been reviewed with representatives of the american stock exchange who indicated that the company s performance would continue to be monitored by the exchange 
the company has been financing the expansion and image enhancement of its restaurants primarily through the use of fixed rate long term debt on which the rate is fixed at the time of funding 
at march  there was  of such debt outstanding at rates ranging from to 
the company s market risk exposure is primarily due to possible fluctuations in interest rates as they relate to future borrowings 
the company has evaluated the potential effect of a increase in these rates on future capital spending plans and believes that there would be no material effect 
the company does not enter into derivative financial investments for trading or speculation purposes 
as a result  the company believes that its market risk exposure is not material to the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
the company expects to commit approximately  to image enhancements and expansions of existing kfc restaurants during fiscal seasonality 
the operations of the company are affected by seasonal fluctuations 
historically  the company s revenues and income have been highest during the summer months with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to weather conditions in the company s marketplace which consists of portions of ohio  pennsylvania  missouri  illinois  west virginia and new york 
critical accounting policies 
the company s reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require it to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
the company believes that its most significant policies require estimation of cash flows associated with the impairment of long lived assets and projected compliance with debt covenants 
determination of the appropriate valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and reserves for potential tax exposures
