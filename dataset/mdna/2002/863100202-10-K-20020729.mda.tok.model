item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under factors that may affect our future results 
overview we develop  manufacture and sell optical subsystems and components for high data rate networking  data storage and telecommunication applications 
these optical subsystems are designed for use in local area networks lans  storage area networks sans  metropolitan area networks mans  wide area networks wans long distance telecommunication networks  and military communications 
our optical subsystems are compatible with the advanced transmission protocols used in these networks  including gigabit ethernet  fast ethernet  fibre channel  infiniband  escon and synchronous optical network sonet 
we also design  manufacture and sell a full line of optical components  cable assemblies and fiber management products for use in these networks 
on february   methode electronics  inc methode announced plans to create a separate company comprised of its optical products businesses 
accordingly  we were incorporated in delaware in april as a wholly owned subsidiary of methode 
in june we launched our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
after the completion of our public offering  methode owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
on march   methode announced that its board of directors had declared a stock dividend of all of methode s shares in us 
the dividend was distributed on april  to methode stockholders of record as of april  the distribution was made on the basis of shares of stratos stock for each share of methode class a and class b common stock held 
our net sales are derived principally from the sale of optical subsystems and components to optical communication original equipment manufacturers oems 
our net sales have fluctuated from period to period based on customer demand for our products  the size and timing of customer orders  particularly from our largest customers  and based on any canceled  delayed or rescheduled orders in the relevant period 
we determine reserves for rapid technological change on a product by product basis 
while it is likely that obsolescence due to rapid technological change will continue  the timing and amount of this obsolescence cannot be predicted with certainty 
the average unit prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature in response to factors such as increased competition  the introduction of new products and increased unit volumes 
we anticipate that average selling prices will continue to decline in future periods  although the timing and degree of the declines cannot be predicted with any certainty 
we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices 
license fees and royalties represent payments received from licensees of our patented technology  which is also used by us in our optical subsystems 
these license agreements generally provide for up front payments and or future fixed payments or ongoing royalty payments based on a percentage of sales of the licensed products 
the timing and amounts of these payments is beyond our control 
accordingly  the amount received in any given period is expected to vary significantly 
the duration of all of these license agreements extends until the expiration of the licensed patents 
we will consider entering into similar agreements in the future  however  we are not able to predict whether we will enter into any additional licenses in the future and  if so  the amount of any license fees or royalties 
our cost of sales consists of materials  salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel and manufacturing overhead 
we purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from a limited number of suppliers 
we have periodically experienced shortages and delivery delays for these materials 
in some circumstances  we maintain an inventory of limited source components to decrease the risk of shortage 
if we overestimate our requirements  we may have excess inventory of these components 
substantially all of our products are designed and manufactured in our own facilities 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of sales is fixed over the near term 
in order to remain competitive  we must continually reduce our manufacturing costs through design and engineering innovations and increases in manufacturing efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our manufacturing costs or introduce new products to offset anticipated decreases in the average selling prices of our products 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers  scientists and other technical personnel  depreciation of test and prototyping equipment  and tooling 
research and development expenses also consist of materials and overhead costs related to major product development projects 
prior to may   research and development expenses have included allocations from methode electronics  inc methode of expenses for salaries and related expenses for research and development personnel 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our long term business success 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development programs in future periods for the purpose of enhancing or reducing the cost of current optical subsystems and components  and developing new optical subsystems and components 
we market and sell our products domestically and internationally through our direct sales force  local resellers and manufacturers representatives 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including sales commissions and product marketing and promotion costs 
prior to may   expenses have included allocations from methode of expenses for the salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel 
we expect to continue to make significant expenditures for sales and marketing services 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our administrative and financial groups  as well as legal  accounting and other professional fees 
general and administrative expenses also include the amortization of goodwill resulting from the excess of the purchase price over net assets of the acquired companies 
prior to may   expenses have included allocations from methode for the salaries and related expenses for administrative  finance and human resources personnel  professional fees  information technology and other corporate expenses 
we expect to continue to make significant expenditures for general and administrative services 
critical accounting policies accounts receivable we sell products primarily to various telecommunications providers and distributors 
sales to these customers have varying degrees of collection risk associated with them 
judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables based on aging  historical experience and customer s financial condition 
inventory reserves it is our policy to reserve of the value of inventory we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process or items that have potential quality problems 
excess inventory is defined as inventory in excess of one year s projected usage 
excess inventory is determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
in general  our policy is to scrap inventory determined to be obsolete shortly after the determination is made and to keep excess inventory for a reasonable amount of time before it is discarded 
occasionally  changed circumstances in the marketplace present us with an opportunity to sell inventory that was previously determined to be excessive and reserved for 
if this occurs  we intend to vigorously pursue such opportunities 
long lived assets impairment we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including goodwill  if the facts and circumstances  such as significant declines in sales  earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate suggest that it may be impaired 
if this review indicates that goodwill or other long lived assets will not be recoverable  as determined based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the long lived asset  impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the long lived asset to fair value 
fair value is determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or appraisals 
if an asset is considered held for sale  we adjust the carrying value of the underlying assets to fair value  as determined based on the estimated net realizable proceeds of the assets 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts  is recognized when title passes  which generally occurs upon shipment 
we handle returns by replacing  repairing or issuing credit for defective products when returned 
we establish a reserve for returns based on any known and anticipated returns 
customer returns it is our policy to establish a reserve for customer returns based on any known and anticipated returns based on past experience 
occasionally  we will receive requests from customers to accept the return of merchandise for which they had previously accepted delivery 
although we have no obligation to do so  each such request is evaluated in light of the contemplation of future business from the customer 
we will continue to consider these requests in the future  however  we are not able to predict that we will enter into any additional agreements in the future  and  if so  the amount of any returns 
research and development all expenses relative to the development of a new product  prior to its introduction into production  are considered research and development expenses 
in addition  the costs of the engineering effort to do significant redesign to enhance product performance that results essentially in a new product are also considered to be research and development expenses 
because the true manufacturability of our products is not obvious until a period of volume production has occurred  initial production is considered a part of the development process 
during this phase  a portion of the scrap expense and yield loss would be considered development expense 
a product is still considered under development until it matures to the point where its production yields volumes are consistent with other mature products and any engineering effort is predominately dedicated to customer applications and or quality support 
basis of presentation our historical consolidated financial statements for periods ending on or prior to may  have been carved out from the consolidated financial statements of methode using the historical results of operations and cash flows and historical basis of the assets and liabilities of our business 
the historical consolidated financial statements also include allocations to us of methode s corporate expenses  including centralized accounting  treasury  information technology  human resources  sales and marketing  legal  real estate and other corporate services and infrastructure costs 
we consider the expense allocations to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of the services provided to us or the benefits received by us 
the consolidated financial statements after may  reflect the operations  cash flows and assets and liabilities of the company on a stand alone basis 
our historical financial information for periods ending on or prior to may   is not indicative of our financial position  results of operation or cash flows in the future  nor is it necessarily indicative of what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been were we a separate  stand alone entity for the periods presented 
our consolidated financial information for periods ending on or prior to may  does not reflect additional expenses which we may incur as a result of being a stand alone public company 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended april  revenue net sales license fees and royalties total cost and expenses cost of sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses income loss from operations investment income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes credit net income loss fiscal years ended april  and net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this million decrease is the result of a million decrease in net sales of optical subsystems and a million decrease in net sales of optical components 
the decrease in net sales during fiscal of our optical subsystems was primarily due to a decrease in sales of our embedded and removable transceivers 
the decrease in sales of our optical components was primarily due to a decrease in sales of our optical backplane connectors and cable assemblies 
the overall decrease in sales was primarily due to lower customer demand due to the current economic climate and reduced capital spending for optical networking equipment 
sales were also negatively impacted by declines in average unit prices for our products resulting from pricing pressure and changes in product mix 
our total sales order backlog decreased to million as of april  from million as of april  of this million decrease in backlog  million was due to a decrease in orders for our optical subsystems  and million was due to a decrease in orders for our optical components 
these decreases reflect lower customer demand for our products  customer push outs and cancellation of orders  due in part to delays in the launch of new product programs by our customers 
license fees and royalties 
license fees and royalties decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease primarily relates to lump sum payments of approximately million from the receipt of license and royalty payments in association with the settlement of several patent infringement cases in fiscal and generally lower sales of optical subsystems and components among licensees consistent with general economic conditions in the optical networking market 
the decrease was partially offset by the receipt of a million lump sum payment from the settlement of a patent infringement suit in fiscal license fees consist of both fixed schedule payments and contingent payments based on sales volumes of licensed products 
cost of sales and gross margins 
cost of sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  decreased to negative in fiscal from in fiscal approximately percentage points of the percentage point decrease in gross margin was due to charges for obsolete and slow moving inventory  percentage points of the decrease in gross margin was a result of the decline in sales and the decline in the average unit selling price for our products due primarily to pricing pressures and product mix  percentage points was due to the expenses related to the restructuring charges including percentage points due to charges for obsolete and slow moving inventory relating to the exit from the single ferrule connector business  percentage points for fixed asset impairment related to the exit from the single ferrule connector business and the discontinuance of the vertical cavity surface emitting laser vcsel development program  and percentage points for employee severance pay related to the restructuring of operations  and percentage points was due to customer returns of unusable inventory 
these factors were offset by the sale of approximately million of inventory that was previously considered excess and fully reserved in the fourth quarter of fiscal the sale of this inventory favorably impacted gross margin by percentage points 
cost of sales was charged approximately million and million in fiscal and to increase the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to million in material and overhead costs related to major product development projects  million of additional personnel costs dedicated to research and development  and million for expanded research and development facilities 
during fiscal  we refined our policy on research and development expenses to include the costs of scrap and the yield loss during the development stage of our products 
the effect of this change was the classification of million in expenses as research and development that would have been classified as cost of sales under the previous policy 
it is not practicable to determine the effect this change would have had on prior years 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due to a decrease of  in sales and marketing salaries  fringe benefits  bonuses and commissions  and  in field sales operating costs supporting our sales volume 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this million increase was due primarily to million of expenses related to the restructuring charges including million for fixed asset impairment related to the proposed sale of the company s bandwidth semiconductor llc subsidiary and the company s corporate aircraft  million for goodwill impairment related to bandwidth semiconductor llc  and million of legal and other costs related to the restructuring of operations  a million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts offset in part by a reduction of  in corporate management costs 
we operate in markets that are currently experiencing a severe economic downturn that began late in the third quarter of fiscal and escalated during the first quarter of fiscal as a result  many of our customers began to stretch their payment terms and our days sales in accounts receivable increased to days at april  days sales in accounts receivable improved to days at april  during the first quarter of fiscal  we identified customers that we considered to be high risk relative to the collection of accounts receivable 
based upon this review  we recorded a million provision for doubtful accounts in the first quarter of fiscal investment income  net 
investment income  net of investment expense  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal investment income consists of earnings on the short term investment of excess cash balances and the decrease of this income in fiscal reflects the reduction of excess cash balances as well as lower interest rates throughout the market place during this period 
income taxes 
the tax benefit recognized in fiscal represents the benefit of tax loss carrybacks available to us 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we determined the need for a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets primarily associated with tax loss carry forwards based on the significant reduction in business levels experienced during the quarter and our revised estimated of taxable earnings for the remainder of the fiscal year 
as a result  a million valuation allowance has been recorded which eliminated the tax benefit attributable to the net losses incurred in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal approximately million  eliminated approximately million of tax benefits recorded in the quarter ended july   and reserved for approximately  of deferred tax assets recorded as of april  we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that are available to offset taxable income in the future 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal years ended april  and net sales 
net sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended april   from million in the fiscal year ended april  this million increase is the result of a million increase in net sales of optical subsystems and a million increase in net sales of optical components 
the increase in sales of our optical subsystems was due primarily to an increase in sales of our embedded and removable transceivers in a variety of wavelengths and form factors 
the increase in sales of our optical components was primarily due to an increase in sales of our optical backplane connectors and cable assemblies 
license fees and royalties 
license fees and royalties increased to million in the fiscal year ended april   from million in the fiscal year ended april  the increase of million principally related to our receipt of up front royalty payments from the settlement of several patent infringement cases 
license fees and royalties consist of both fixed schedule payments and contingent payments based on sales volumes of licensed products 
cost of sales and gross margins 
cost of sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended april   from million in the fiscal year ended april  the increase was due primarily to increases in the production of both our optical subsystems and optical components 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  decreased to in the fiscal year ended april   from in the fiscal year ended april  approximately of the decrease in gross margin was the result of recording a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal year due to decreased demand for certain products 
the balance of the decrease was due to declines in average unit prices for our products due primarily to pricing pressure and product mix 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended april   from million in the fiscal year ended april  this increase was due primarily to million in material and overhead costs related to major product development projects  million of additional personnel costs dedicated to research and development   for legal costs related to intellectual property and million for new and expanded research and development facilities in chicago  illinois  and bedford  massachusetts 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended april   from million in the fiscal year ended april  this increase was due to an increase of million in sales and marketing salaries  fringe benefits  bonuses and commissions  and  in field sales operating costs supporting our sales volume 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended april   from million in the fiscal year ended april  this million increase was due primarily to million of additional costs for expanded facilities and staff  million of additional corporate management costs and million in legal fees for the settlement of certain patent infringement cases 
investment income  net 
investment income  net of investment expense  increased to million in the fiscal year ended april  investment income consists of earnings on the short term investment of excess cash balances 
we did not have any investment income in the fiscal year ended april income taxes 
the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year ended april   compared with for the fiscal year ended april  the overall decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal was principally the result of investment income not taxable for federal income tax purposes 
no separate tax returns have been filed for our business because our operating results have been fully consolidated for tax purposes with the results of methode 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities totaled million for fiscal the use of cash in operating activities resulted primarily from the net loss and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset in part by decreases in accounts receivable and inventories 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal and resulted primarily from growth in net income and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  which were offset in part by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities during these periods related primarily to acquisitions  purchases of equipment and facilities  and the purchase of short term investments in fiscal and we expended million for the acquisition of polycore technologies  inc in july  million for the acquisition of the optoelectronics division of spire corporation in december   for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of b h mold  inc in november   to increase our investment in mp optical communications llc in march  million for the acquisition of substantially all of the net assets of the optical flexcircuits division of advanced interconnection technology  inc and million net of cash received for the acquisition of tsunami optics  inc in february in addition  the company acquired million in cash from the acquisition of all the outstanding common stock of paracer  inc in march net cash used in financing activities for fiscal represents repayments on long term borrowings 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal consisted primarily of net proceeds of million  after related expenses  from our initial public offering  offset by million in net advances repaid to methode subsidiaries and  for repayment of a note assumed in connection with the acquisition of our stratos ltd 
subsidiary 
we sold  shares of common stock at per share in our initial public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal consisted primarily of cash contributions from methode 
as of april   our principal source of liquidity was approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our future net sales and the timing and rate of expansion of our business 
our only cash commitment is the repayment of long term debt of approximately million 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and repayments of long term debt for the next months 
factors that may affect our future results risks relating to our business we have recently incurred significant net losses  primarily due to the current economic downturn 
unless we are able to increase our sales or further reduce our costs  we will continue to incur net losses 
the current economic downturn has resulted in reduced capital spending for optical networking products 
as a result  many of our customers have significantly reduced  cancelled or rescheduled orders for our products and expressed uncertainty as to their future requirements 
we experienced a decrease in net sales of and incurred a net loss of million during fiscal we expect difficult industry conditions to continue for at least the next to months and may continue for a longer period 
any continued or further decline in demand for our customers products or in general economic conditions would likely result in further reduction in demand for our products and our business  operating results and financial condition would suffer 
although we have implemented personnel reductions and other cost reduction programs  many of our costs are fixed in the near term and we expect to continue to incur significant manufacturing  research and development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses 
consequently  we will need to generate higher revenues while containing costs and operating expenses if we are to return to profitability 
if our efforts to increase our revenues and contain our costs are not successful  we will continue to incur net losses 
our net sales and operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter  and our stock price may fall if our quarterly performance does not meet analysts or investors expectations 
our quarterly net sales and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our net sales and operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
some of the factors which cause our net sales and operating results to vary include 
the timing of customer orders  particularly from our largest customers  
the level of demand for our customers products  
the cancellation or postponement of orders  
our ability to manufacture and ship our products on a timely basis  
changes in our product mix  
competitive pressures resulting in lower prices  
our ability to control costs and expenses  
the introduction of new products or technologies by us or our competitors  
the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalty payments relating to our intellectual property  and 
general economic factors 
our net sales and operating results have been and in one or more future quarters will likely be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
our success depends on the long term growth of communication networks and their use of optical communication technologies 
if these events do not occur  our net sales may decline and our business would likely be significantly harmed 
our optical subsystems and components are used primarily in enterprise  metropolitan area  wide area and telecommunication networks 
these markets are rapidly evolving and it is difficult to predict their potential size or future growth rate 
in addition  there is uncertainty as to the extent to which optical communication technologies will be used throughout these markets 
our success in generating revenue in these markets will depend on the long term growth of these markets and their use of optical communication technologies 
if these markets do not grow  or if the use of optical communication technologies in these markets does not expand  our net sales may decline and our business would likely be significantly harmed 
we must develop new products and technology as well as enhancements to existing products and technology in order to remain competitive 
if we fail to do so  our products will no longer be competitive and our net sales will decline 
the market for our products and technology is characterized by rapid technological change  new and improved product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our future success will depend to a substantial extent on our ability to develop  introduce and support new products and technology on a successful and timely basis 
if we fail to develop and deploy new products and technologies or enhancements of existing products on a successful and timely basis or we experience delays in the development  introduction or enhancement of our products and technologies  our products will no longer be competitive and our net sales will decline 
the introduction of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products 
in addition  a slowdown in demand for existing products ahead of a new product introduction could result in a write down in the value of inventory on hand relating to existing products 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  if at all  or on a timely basis 
further  we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards 
any failure to respond to technological change would significantly harm our business 
our products are incorporated into larger systems which must comply with various domestic and international government regulations 
if the performance of our products contributes to our customers inability to comply with these requirements  we may lose these customers and our net sales will decline 
in the united states  our products are incorporated into larger systems which must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories 
internationally  our products are incorporated into larger systems which must also comply with standards established by local authorities in various countries which may vary considerably 
if the performance of our products contributes to our customers inability to comply with existing or evolving standards established by regulatory authorities or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals we may lose these customers and our net sales will decline 
if our products fail to comply with evolving industry standards or alternative technologies in our markets  we may be required to make significant expenditures to redesign our products 
our products comprise only a part of an entire networking system and must comply with evolving industry standards in order to gain market acceptance 
in many cases  we introduce a product before an industry standard has become widely accepted and we depend on the companies that provide other components to support industry standards as they evolve 
because industry standards do not exist in some cases at the time we are developing new products  we may develop products that do not comply with the eventual industry standard 
if this occurs  we would need to redesign our products to comply with adopted industry standards 
in addition  if alternative technologies are adopted as an industry standard within our target markets  we would have to dedicate significant time and resources to redesign our products to meet this new industry standard 
if we are required to redesign our products  we may incur significant expenses and losses due to lack of customer demand  unusable purchased components for these products and the diversion of our engineers from future product development efforts 
if we are not successful in redesigning our products or developing new products to meet new standards or any other standard that may emerge  our net sales will decline 
we derive a significant portion of our net sales from a few large customers  and our net sales may decline significantly if any of these customers cancels  reduces or delays purchases of our products 
our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers 
for the fiscal year ended april   mcdata corporation and its contract manufacturers accounted for of our net sales 
for the fiscal year  our three largest customers and their respective contract manufacturers accounted for of our net sales  with mcdata corporation  alcatel network systems and cisco systems accounting for  and of our net sales  respectively 
we expect our dependence on sales to a small number of large customers to continue 
the markets in which we sell our products are dominated by a relatively small number of systems manufacturers  thereby limiting the number of our potential customers 
as a result  our relationships with these customers are critically important to our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers  that we will be able to attract additional customers or that our customers will be successful in selling their products which incorporate our products 
our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us and will continue to do so in the future 
also  many of our customers have canceled  reduced or delayed purchases of our products 
further  some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to joint ventures between these customers and our competitors 
the loss of or a significant reduction in orders from one or more of our largest customers  our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or future price concessions that we may make could cause our net sales to significantly decline 
our sales cycle runs from our customers initial design to production for commercial sale 
this cycle is long and unpredictable and may cause our net sales to decline or increase our operating expenses 
we cannot predict the timing of our sales accurately because of the length of our sales cycles 
as a result  if sales forecasts from specific customers are not realized  we may be unable to compensate for the sales shortfall and our net sales may decline 
the period of time between our initial contact with a customer and the receipt of a purchase order may span up to a year or more  and varies by product and customer 
during this time  customers may perform  or require us to perform  extensive evaluation and qualification testing of our products 
generally  they consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products  including ability to interoperate with other subsystems and components  product performance and reliability 
we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort while our potential customers are qualifying our products 
even after incurring these costs  we ultimately may not sell any or only small amounts of our products to these potential customers 
consequently  if new sales do not result from our efforts to qualify our products  our operating expenses will increase 
our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time and may cancel or defer purchases on short notice  which may cause our net sales to decline or increase our operating expenses 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers 
sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders  often with extremely short lead times  that may be canceled or deferred by customers on short notice without significant penalty 
our customers base their orders for our products on the forecasted sales and manufacturing schedules for their own products 
our customers have in the past significantly accelerated  canceled or delayed orders for our products in response to unanticipated changes in the manufacturing schedules for their own products  and will likely do so again in the future 
during the last twelve months  our customers have cancelled a significant number of orders 
the reduction  cancellation or delay of individual customer purchase orders has caused and could continue to cause our net sales to decline 
moreover  these uncertainties complicate our ability to accurately plan our manufacturing schedule and may increase our operating expenses 
if we do not decrease our manufacturing costs or increase sales of higher margin products as the average unit price of our existing products decreases  our gross margins will decline 
the average unit price of our products generally decrease as the products mature in response to increased competition  the introduction of new products and increased unit volumes 
substantially all of our products are designed and manufactured in our own facilities 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of sales is fixed over the near term 
in order to remain competitive  we must continually reduce our manufacturing costs through design and engineering changes and increases in manufacturing efficiencies 
we must also continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices 
our inability to reduce manufacturing costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices will cause our gross margins to decline  which would significantly harm our operating results 
the market for optical subsystems and components is highly competitive  which may result in lost sales or lower gross margins 
the markets for optical subsystems and components are highly competitive and are expected to intensify in the future 
for optical subsystems  we compete primarily with agilent technologies  inc  finisar corporation  infineon technologies corp  jds uniphase corporation and optical communications products  inc for optical components  we compete primarily with infineon technologies corp  lucent technologies inc  molex  inc 
and tyco international  ltd 
and numerous other smaller companies 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources and brand name recognition than we have 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  several of our competitors have large market capitalizations or cash reserves and are much better positioned than we are to acquire other companies in our consolidating industry in order to gain new technologies or products 
many of our competitors have much greater name recognition  more extensive customer bases  better developed distribution channels and broader product offerings 
these companies can leverage their customer bases and broader product offerings and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
in addition  companies with diversified product offerings can better sustain an economic downturn 
we expect that more companies  including some of our customers  will enter the markets for our products 
we may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors 
competitive pressures  combined with weakening demand  may result in further price reductions  lower margins and loss of market share 
in addition  some of our current and potential customers are attempting to integrate their operations by producing their own optical subsystems or components or acquiring one or more of our competitors which may eliminate the need to purchase our products 
furthermore  larger companies in other related industries are developing and acquiring technologies and applying their significant resources  including their distribution channels and brand name recognition  in an effort to capture significant market share 
while this trend has not historically impacted our competitive position  it may result in future decreases in our net sales 
we depend on suppliers for several key components 
if we underestimate or overestimate our requirements for these components  our business could be significantly harmed 
we purchase several key components that are incorporated into our products from a limited number of suppliers 
we have experienced shortages and delays in obtaining key components in the past and expect to experience shortages and delays in the future 
these shortages and delays have typically occurred when demand within the industry has increased rapidly and exceeds the capacity of suppliers of key components in the short term 
delays and shortages also often occur in the early stages of a product s life cycle 
the length of shortages and delays in the past has varied from several days to a month 
we are unable to predict the length of any future shortages or delays 
the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components that meet our quality requirements may interrupt and delay the manufacturing of our products or result in the cancellation of orders for our products 
in addition  our suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these components at any time 
we may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion  or at all 
any transition to alternative suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit our ability to deliver products to our customers 
furthermore  if we are unable to identify an alternative source of supply  we may have to redesign or modify our products  which may cause delays in shipments  increased design and manufacturing costs and increased prices for our products 
we make forecasts for our component requirements based on anticipated product orders 
although we enter into long term agreements for the purchase of key components from time to time  our purchases of key components are generally made on a purchase order basis 
we may also maintain an inventory of limited source components to limit the potential impact of a component shortage 
we may not accurately predict the demand for our products and the lead time required to obtain key components 
if we overestimate our requirements  we may have excess inventory  which may become obsolete and would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers 
either of these occurrences would significantly harm our business 
our success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified technical personnel  and if we are unable to do so  our product development efforts and customer relations will suffer 
our products require sophisticated manufacturing  research and development  marketing and sales  and technical support 
our success depends on our ability to attract  train and retain qualified technical personnel in each of these areas 
competition for personnel in all of these areas is intense and we may not be able to hire or retain sufficient personnel to achieve our goals or support the anticipated growth in our business 
the market for the highly trained personnel we require is very competitive  due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products and technology 
if we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel  our product development efforts and customer relations will suffer 
our products may contain defects which may cause us to incur significant costs  divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers 
our products are complex and may contain defects  particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our customers integrate our subsystems and components into systems and products that they develop themselves or acquire from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in equipment or a system into which our products have been incorporated  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
we may be subject to liability claims for damages related to product defects or experience manufacturing delays as a result of these defects in the future  any or all of which could be substantial 
the length of any future manufacturing delays in connection with a product defect will depend on the nature of the defect and whether we or one of our component suppliers was the source of the defect 
moreover  the occurrence of defects  whether caused by our products or technology or the products of another vendor  may result in significant customer relations problems and injury to our reputation and may impair the market acceptance of our products and technology 
we are subject to environmental laws and other legal requirements that have the potential to subject us to substantial liability and increase our costs of doing business 
our properties and business operations are subject to a wide variety of federal  state  and local environmental  health and safety laws and other legal requirements  including those relating to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our manufacturing processes 
we cannot assure you that these legal requirements will not impose on us the need for additional capital expenditures or other requirements 
if we fail to obtain required permits or otherwise fail to operate within these or future legal requirements  we may be required to pay substantial penalties  suspend our operations or make costly changes to our manufacturing processes or facilities 
although we believe that we are in compliance and have complied with all applicable legal requirements  we may also be required to incur additional costs to comply with current or future legal requirements 
economic  political and regulatory risks associated with international operations may limit our sales and increase our costs of doing business abroad 
a portion of our sales are generated from customers located outside the united states  principally in europe 
we also operate manufacturing facilities in china and the united kingdom 
sales to customers located outside of the united states were approximately of our net sales during fiscal and approximately of our net sales in fiscal our international operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including 
difficulties in managing operations in different locations  
changes in foreign currency rates  
longer accounts receivable collection cycles  
difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  
seasonal reductions in business activities in some parts of the world  such as during the summer months in europe  
trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements  
changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  
potentially adverse tax consequences  
the potential difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries  and 
acts of terrorism directed against the united states or us affiliated targets 
these factors could adversely impact our international sales or increase our costs of doing business abroad or impair our ability to expand into international markets  and therefore could significantly harm our business 
we intend to pursue additional acquisitions 
if we are unable to successfully integrate any businesses or technologies that we acquire in the future or are unable to realize the intended benefits of any future acquisitions  our business will be harmed 
as part of our strategy  we intend to pursue opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand our markets or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
our experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies is limited 
acquisitions could result in a number of financial consequences  including 
use of significant amounts of cash  
the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  
potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  
large one time write offs  and 
amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
acquisitions also involve numerous operational risks  including 
difficulties in integrating operations  products  technologies and personnel  
unanticipated costs or write offs associated with the acquisition  
diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
diversion of capital and other resources from our existing businesses  and 
potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations 
if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses or any other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in the future or are unable to realize the intended benefits of any future acquisitions  our business will be harmed 
our recent acquisitions have not generated significant sales and require significant amounts of capital 
if these businesses do not become profitable  our operating results could be seriously harmed 
in february  we acquired all of the capital stock of tsunami optics  inc in march  we acquired all of the capital stock of paracer  inc 
the integration of these businesses into our company is not complete 
these businesses are expected to focus on the development and introduction of new products and have not generated significant revenues to date 
in addition  these businesses have or will require significant amounts of capital to support their product development activities  and we expect to continue to invest substantial amounts of capital in these businesses for the foreseeable future 
if these businesses do not become profitable  our operating results could be seriously harmed 
our inability to protect our intellectual property rights would significantly impair their value and our competitive position 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
although we have numerous issued patents and pending patent applications  we cannot assure you that any patents will issue as a result of our pending patent applications or  if issued  that any patent claim allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any existing or future patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any right granted thereunder would provide us with meaningful protection of our technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property or to take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
further  enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and the success of these efforts cannot be predicted with certainty 
litigation has been necessary and may continue to be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
this litigation could be costly and its outcome cannot be predicted with certainty 
our inability to adequately protect against unauthorized use of our intellectual property would significantly impair its value and our competitive position 
we are currently involved in pending patent litigation which  if decided against us  could impair our ability to prevent others from using our technology  result in the loss of future royalty income and require us to pay significant monetary damages 
we are plaintiffs in several lawsuits relating to our intellectual property rights 
the defendants in these lawsuits include infineon technologies corp 
and e  inc in these actions  stratos alleges that optoelectronic products sold by the defendants infringe upon certain stratos patents 
the defendants in these lawsuits have filed various affirmative defenses 
these lawsuits are in the preliminary stage  and we cannot predict their outcome with certainty 
if one or more of these patents were found to be invalid or unenforceable  we would lose the ability to prevent others from using the technologies covered by the invalidated patents 
this could result in significant decreases in our sales and gross margins for our products that use these technologies 
in addition  we would lose the future royalty payments from our current licensees of these patents 
we could also be required to pay significant monetary damages to one or more of the defendants or be required to reimburse them for their legal fees 
accordingly  if one or more of these patents were found to be invalid or unenforceable  our business would be significantly harmed 
claims that we infringe third party intellectual property rights could result in significant monetary damages and expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
from time to time  third parties may assert patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies used in our business 
in addition  our rights to use our name or other trademarks are subject to challenge by others 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
if we are unsuccessful in defending ourselves against these types of claims  we could be subject to significant monetary damages and may be required to do one or more of the following 
stop using the challenged trademarks or selling our products that use or incorporate the relevant technology  
attempt to obtain a license to sell or use the challenged intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  or 
redesign those products that use the relevant technology 
in the event a claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our business would be significantly harmed 
we are currently defending several class action lawsuits which could subject us to significant money damages  cause us to incur significant costs or otherwise harm our business 
we and certain of our executive officers are defendants in certain purported class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court  southern district of new york 
although we believe these lawsuits are without merit  an adverse result in these lawsuits could subject us to significant money damages 
this litigation may also require us to incur significant costs in defense of these lawsuits  could require significant involvement of our senior management and may divert management s attention from our business and operations  any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operation or financial condition 
risks relating to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock the market prices for securities of technology related companies have been volatile in recent years and our stock price could fluctuate significantly 
our common stock has been publicly traded only since june  the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering 
these fluctuations could continue 
factors that could affect our stock price include 
economic and stock market conditions generally and specifically as they may impact participants in the communication industry  
earnings and other announcements by  and changes in market evaluations of  participants in the optical communication industry  
changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts following our stock  
announcements or implementation by us or our competitors of technical innovations or new products  and 
strategic moves by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions 
in addition  the securities of many companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years  often unrelated to the companies operating performance 
specifically  market prices for securities of technology related companies have frequently reached elevated levels  often following their initial public offerings 
these levels may not be sustainable and may not bear any relationship to these companies operating performances 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of your shares 
our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include a classified board of directors and limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquiror 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although certain of our subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  foreign currency exposures arising from these transactions are not material to us 
the primary foreign currency exposure arises from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed are the pound sterling and chinese renminbi
