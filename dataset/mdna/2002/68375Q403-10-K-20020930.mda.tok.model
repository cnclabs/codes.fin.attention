item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
overview we design  manufacture and market fiber optic subsystems  integrated modules and components that expand optical bandwidth  amplify optical signals  monitor and protect wavelength performance and redirect light signals within an optical network 
we offer a broad line of products that increase the performance of optical networks and enable service providers and optical system manufacturers to provide flexible and scalable bandwidth to support the increase of data traffic on the internet and other public and private networks 
our bandwidth creation products increase the performance and capacity of fiber optic networks 
our bandwidth management products provide communications service providers with the ability to monitor and manage optical signals to enhance network performance 
we produce optical subsystems  integrated modules and fiber optic components for next generation  all optical dense wavelength division multiplexing  or dwdm  optical amplification  switching and routing  and monitoring and conditioning applications 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from the sale of fiber optic subsystems  integrated modules and components 
to date  we have developed over standard products that are sold or integrated into customized solutions for our customers 
our products are generally categorized into the following major groups our bandwidth creation products  which include wavelength expansion and optical amplification products  and our bandwidth management products  which include wavelength performance monitoring and protection  and optical switching products 
a majority of our revenues are derived from our bandwidth creation products  which include our wavelength expansion products  in particular  dwdms and multiplexers used in optical amplification 
during the fiscal year ended june   our revenues were substantially reduced  by to million  our headcount was reduced by  people  or  our manufacturing operations were moved to china and we further reduced our cost structure to respond to the significantly lower revenues than previously experienced by the company due to the severe downturn in the market for fiber optic subsystems  integrated modules and components 
the fiber optics industry has been in a significant period of consolidation following a dramatic slowdown in capital spending since late by carriers faced with substantial excess bandwidth capacity and high levels of corporate debt 
beginning in late  as the industry entered its downturn and consolidation phase  various customers canceled existing orders 
we incurred substantial costs associated with excess and obsolete inventory  workforce reduction  canceled orders  excess fixed assets  excess facilities and other special charges 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists of raw material  salaries and related personnel expense  manufacturing overhead  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventories and warranties 
we expect cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  to fluctuate from period to period 
our gross margins will primarily be affected by manufacturing volume  our pricing policies  production yield  costs incurred in improving manufacturing processes  mix of products sold  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories and mix of products manufactured in china or the united states 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  depreciation  non recurring engineering charges and prototype costs  patent filing costs and fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  all of which relate to the design  development  testing  pre manufacturing and significant improvement of our products 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for marketing  sales  customer service and application engineering support personnel  
table of contents commissions paid to internal and external sales representatives  as well as costs associated with promotional  trade shows and other marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  and human resources personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
non cash compensation expense 
prior to our initial public offering  we granted stock options and issued warrants to employees and consultants at prices below the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant or issuance 
during the period from july  through june   we recorded aggregate deferred stock compensation  net of cancellations  of approximately million of which million  million and million was expensed during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
while this expense has increased our net loss  it has had no impact on our cash flows 
with respect to employee stock based compensation  we are amortizing the deferred compensation expense over the vesting period  as set forth in fasb interpretation no 
 or fin under the fin method  each vested tranche of options is accounted for as a separate option grant awarded for services 
the compensation expenses are recognized over the period during which the services are provided 
accordingly  this method results in higher compensation expenses being recognized in the earlier vesting periods of an option 
non employee grants are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and emerging issues task force  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf and valued using the black scholes model 
the deferred compensation expense related to non employees stock option grants are amortized over the vesting period as set forth in fin the remaining million will be expensed over future remaining vesting periods 
we estimate that our deferred stock compensation expense from options and shares granted or issued from july through june  will be million  million and  for the years ending june   and  assuming no cancellations or additional stock option grants with exercise prices below fair value of our common stock 
in october  we sold  shares of common stock in an underwritten initial public offering  including  shares of common stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million  before offering expenses of approximately million 
simultaneously with the closing of the public offering   shares of convertible preferred stock were converted to shares of common stock on a one for one basis 
in addition  the note payable to cisco systems and the related interest expense was converted into  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  or of the public offering price of per share 
the discount feature of this convertible note payable resulted in a charge of million  recorded as sales and marketing expense in the quarter ended december  acquisition of aurora 
in june  we acquired aurora associates and aurora photonics  inc aurora in a transaction accounted for as a purchase business combination 
aurora is a developer of acoustic optic ao devices and systems 
these advanced ao devices and systems are classified as spatial ao deflectors and bragg cells  temporal ao modulators and frequency shifters and spectral ao tunable filter modulations 
the purchase price comprised million cash   shares of common stock valued at   of transaction costs and  in assumed liabilities 
the total purchase price aggregated million and was allocated to tangible assets acquired of  identifiable intangible assets acquired of  goodwill of  and in process research and development ip r d of  acquisition of telelight 
in april  we acquired telelight communication inc  telelight in a merger transaction accounted for as a purchase business combination 
the purchase price comprised  shares of common stock valued at million and  of acquisition costs 
the total purchase price aggregated million and was allocated to tangible assets acquired of million  identifiable intangible assets acquired of million  goodwill of million  deferred tax liability of million and ip 
table of contents r d of million 
in june  the company restructured and abandoned the telelight technology 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets representing of the remaining value of the telelight acquisition 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  and the company s procedures relating to these policies  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue using the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists 
under these guidelines  revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment of the product or customer acceptance  which ever is later  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and no significant obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue associated with contract related cancellation payments from customers is recognized when a formal agreement is signed or a purchase order issued by the customer covering such payments and the collectibility of the cancellation payments is determined to be probable 
in addition  we estimate what future product returns based upon actual historical return rates and reduce our revenue by these estimated future returns 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  future estimates could be revised accordingly 
warranty obligations we provide reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical experience of known product failure rates and expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
additionally  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than needed  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
risk evaluation financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable 
substantially all of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are managed or held by three financial institutions 
such deposits are in excess of the amount of the insurance provided by the federal government on such deposits 
to date  we have not experienced any losses on such deposits 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the united states  europe and asia 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and currently 
table of contents require no collateral from our customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses are maintained in anticipation of the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  such as the result of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific allowance to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer s outstanding receivable balance 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of customers  and if the condition or circumstances of our customers deteriorates  estimates of the recoverability of trade receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provide for more allowances than needed  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on actual collection experience 
excess and obsolete inventory we regularly assess the valuation of inventories and write down those inventories which are obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value 
estimates of realizable value are based upon our analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  forecasted sales levels by product  expected product lifecycle  product development plans and future demand requirements 
if market conditions are less favorable than our forecast or actual demand from customers is lower than our estimates  we may be required to record additional inventory write downs 
if demand is higher than expected  we may sell inventories that had previously been written down 
in recent periods we have recorded significant charges related to excess and obsolete inventory 
see restructuring costs and other special charges below 
property  plant and equipment we evaluate the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of property  plant and equipment  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows was less than the carrying amount of the assets  we would write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
in the years ended june   and  we had no such write down 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rate and terminal growth rates 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of property  plant and equipment  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
in recent periods we have recorded significant charges related to excess fixed assets and facilities 
see restructuring costs and other special charges below 
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
a million charge 
table of contents was recorded based upon an impairment analysis of the carrying amount of the goodwill and purchased intangible assets related to the telelight acquisition during the fiscal year ended june  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on july  we ceased to amortize goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
results of operations for each of the years ended june   and revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was substantially due to decreased shipments of all our products including our wavelength expansion products  optical amplification products and optical switching products to existing and new customers 
the decreases in shipments were primarily due to the slowdown in telecommunications equipment spending 
additionally  in fiscal there was a minor impact due to decreases in average selling prices of our products over the prior year 
further declines in shipments and average selling prices are anticipated through the fiscal year ended june  included in revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  is million and million  respectively  for contract cancellation fees from significant customers 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily due to increased shipments of our existing wavelength expansion products  optical amplification products and optical switching products to existing and new customers  and shipments of new products to existing and new customers 
this increase was offset by decreases in the average selling price of many of our products 
during the fiscal year ended june   we reduced our headcount by  people  or  moved our manufacturing operations to china and further reduced our cost structure to respond to the significantly lower revenues than previously anticipated by the company 
we expect to continue to implement programs to improve manufacturing yields and reduce costs 
there is no certainty that these programs will be successful to offset the reduced shipments to customers and declining average selling prices 
future additional actions by us in response to reduced shipments to customers and declining average selling prices could include further reductions in headcount  transitioning a portion of our current research and development in the united states to china and further consolidation of assets and facilities 
our visibility continues to be limited with respect to telecommunications equipment providers 
we will continue to evaluate our business on an ongoing basis in light of current and future revenue trends and adjust our cost structure accordingly 
gross profit loss 
the following table summarizes gross margin as a percentage of revenue years ended june  revenue gross profit calculation of gross profit excluding special items non cash compensation provision for excess inventory cancellation fee revenue sale of fully reserved inventory gross profit excluding special items 
table of contents gross profit decreased million  or  to a gross loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  from a gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended june  this resulted in a decrease in gross margin from to 
our gross margin for the fiscal year ended june   was negatively impacted by the million excess inventory charge and  non cash compensation expense  partially offset by the million in revenues for cancellation fees from significant customers and the unexpected sale of inventory that had been previously fully reserved of  our gross margin for the fiscal year ended june   was negatively impacted by the million excess inventory charge and million non cash compensation expense partially offset by the million in revenues for cancellation fees from significant customers 
excluding special items  this resulted in a decrease in our gross profit of million  or  to a gross loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  from a gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended june  gross margin  excluding special items  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the excess inventory charges reflect the continued significant downturn in customer demand 
in response to this downturn  we focused on completing the transition of substantially all of our manufacturing to china 
we cannot assure you that this transition will result in improved gross margins due to the cost benefits of manufacturing in china 
we are continuing to implement programs to further improve production yields of our products 
we cannot assure you  however  that these programs will be successful in increasing our gross margin 
in addition to the special items  our gross margin decreased due to higher manufacturing costs relative to our production volume  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the transfer of our manufacturing capacity to china and lower yields in our manufacturing facilities in china due to the rapid manufacturing transfer partially offset by cost savings associated with the worldwide workforce reduction and the consolidation of excess facilities and the cost benefits of operating in china 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  this resulted in a decrease in gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in our gross margin was primarily due to a million provision for excess and obsolete inventory and million non cash compensation expense recorded in the fiscal year ended june   compared to a provision of million and non cash compensation expense of million in the fiscal year ended june   higher manufacturing costs relative to our production volume  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the transfer of our manufacturing capacity and lower yields in our manufacturing facilities in china 
these decreases were partially offset by yield improvements in our domestic manufacturing facilities and the cost benefits of manufacturing in china 
manufacturing overhead costs  excluding non cash compensation expense  associated with the expansion of our manufacturing operations both domestically and internationally increased million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the prior fiscal year 
research and development 
research and development expenses  excluding non cash compensation expense of  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in research and development expenses was due primarily to cost savings of million associated with the worldwide workforce reductions 
research and development expenses  excluding non cash compensation expense  increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were primarily due to the substantial increase in personnel  an increase in prototype expenses for the design and development of new products as well as significant improvements to existing products  depreciation expense and an increase in occupancy costs due to expansion of facilities 
research and development expenses  including non cash compensation expense  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses  including non cash compensation expense  increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  we believe that developing customer solutions at the prototype stage is critical to our strategic product development objectives 
we further believe that  in order to meet the changing requirements of our customers  we will need to fund investments in several concurrent product development projects even in the face of decreased demand 
we expect our research 
table of contents and development expenses to decrease in dollar amount and increase as a percentage of revenues for the next fiscal quarter as we continue to cut costs  transition research and development to china and develop new products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses  excluding non cash compensation recovery of  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  sales and marketing expenses  excluding non cash compensation recovery for the fiscal year ended june   and a charge of million related to the discount feature of the convertible note payable to cisco systems and non cash compensation expense for the fiscal year ended june   decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  and increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the prior fiscal year were primarily due to lower commissions paid to our internal and external sales representatives associated with decreased revenues and a decrease in tradeshow costs  advertising and other customer related costs 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing personnel and personnel related costs and occupancy costs 
sales and marketing expenses  excluding non cash compensation expense  increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increases in sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the prior fiscal year were primarily due to a substantial increase in sales and marketing personnel and personnel related costs  commissions to our internal and external sales representatives  tradeshow  advertising and other customer related costs 
sales and marketing expenses  including non cash compensation recovery and excluding the cisco systems conversion charge  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  sales and marketing expenses  including non cash compensation expense and excluding the cisco systems conversion charge  increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  sales and marketing expenses  including the cisco systems conversion charge and non cash compensation recovery  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  sales and marketing expenses  including the cisco systems conversion charge and non cash compensation expense  increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to remain flat in dollar amount and increase as a percentage of revenues for the next fiscal quarter 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash compensation expense  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a reduction in our legal fees and cost savings associated with the worldwide workforce reduction 
general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash compensation expense  increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increases in general and administrative expenses were primarily due to costs associated with the substantial increase in personnel and personnel related costs  occupancy costs  legal fees and costs associated with the reporting requirements of a public company 
general and administrative expenses  including non cash compensation expense  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  general and administrative expenses  including non cash compensation expense  increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  we expect our general and administrative expenses to remain flat in dollar amount and increase as a percentage of revenues for the next fiscal quarter as we continue to cut costs 

table of contents non cash compensation expense 
from july  through june   we had recorded an aggregate of million in deferred non cash compensation  net of cancellations 
non cash compensation expense decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in deferred non cash compensation was primarily due to the method under which the deferred non cash compensation was amortized  as set out in fasb interpretation no 
 and stock option cancellations 
non cash compensation expense increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  restructuring costs and other special charges 
we  like many of our peers in the telecommunications industry  continue to be affected by the slowdown in telecommunications equipment spending 
our revenues have been generally decreasing in sequential quarters from million in the fiscal quarter ended december  to million  million  million  million  million  and ending with million in the fiscal quarter ended june  due to the continued weakness in the general economy  and the telecom sector in particular  year over year revenue growth is expected to decline further compared to the fiscal year ended june   putting downward pressure on margins and profits 
due to this decline in business conditions  we continued to restructure our business and realigned resources to focus on monitoring costs  preserving cash  accelerating our planned move of manufacturing operations to china and focused on core opportunities 
for the year ended june   million of restructuring costs and other special charges were incurred and classified as operating expenses 
in addition  a million and million excess and obsolete inventory charge was recorded to cost of sales for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
for the year ended june  the restructuring plan included a charge of million for worldwide workforce reduction and consolidation of excess facilities 
additionally  a million charge was recorded based upon an impairment analysis of the carrying amount of the goodwill and purchased intangible assets related to the telelight acquisition 
while we believe that the correction to our inventory levels will not continue at the same level as experienced in the fiscal years ended june  and  we do expect further workforce reductions  excess fixed asset charges and facility closures in the future 
the following paragraphs provide detailed information relating to the restructuring costs  other special charges and excess and obsolete inventory charge 
worldwide workforce reduction our worldwide workforce reductions started in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fiscal year ended june   we recorded a charge of approximately million primarily related to severance and fringe benefits associated with the planned reduction of approximately  employees 
of the approximate  employee planned reduction  approximately  were engaged in manufacturing activities and approximately and  were from sites located in san jose  california and china  respectively 
as of june   approximately  employees had been terminated 
the planned worldwide workforce reductions will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of calendar excess fixed assets  facilities and other special charges we recorded a restructuring charge of million relating to excess fixed assets during the fiscal year ended june  the excess fixed assets charge represented the charge required to re measure such assets at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the carrying amount of the remaining fixed assets to be disposed of was million as of june   and has been included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
while the remaining assets with an original cost of million removed from operations as of june  are being actively marketed  we expect the period of disposal to be an additional twelve months for most of the assets 
the property and equipment disposed of or removed from operations were related to the manufacture of fiber optic networking subsystems  integrated modules and components and consisted primarily of production and engineering equipment  but also included leasehold improvements  computer equipment  office equipment and furniture and fixtures 
in addition  we incurred a charge of million for leases primarily related to excess or closed facilities with planned exit dates 
we estimated the cost of the facility leases based on the contractual 
table of contents terms of the agreements and then current real estate market conditions 
we determined that it would take approximately two years to sublease the various properties that will be vacated  and then subleased at lower values then we are contractually obligated to pay 
amounts related to the lease expense net of anticipated sublease proceeds will be paid over the respective lease terms through the consolidation of excess facilities includes the closure of certain manufacturing and research and development facilities located in san jose  california and beijing  chengdu and fuzhou  china 
the total number of sites closed under the restructuring plan is six 
we also recorded other restructuring costs and special charges of million relating primarily to payments due to suppliers and vendors to terminate agreements for the purchase of capital equipment and inventory 
summary a summary of the restructuring costs and other special charges is outlined as follows in thousands workforce reduction excess fixed assets consolidation of excess facilities and other charges impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets total initial restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal non cash charge cash payments balance at june  accrued restructuring  current accrued restructuring  non current additional restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal non cash charge cash payments balance at june  accrued restructuring  current accrued restructuring  non current provision for inventory we recorded provisions for excess and obsolete inventory totaling million and million  which was charged to cost of sales during the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
this excess inventory charge was due to a sudden and material decline in backlog and forecasted revenue 
we evaluate the need to provide write downs for excess and obsolete inventory on an individual part analysis based on estimated future sales of our products compared to quantities on hand at each balance sheet date 
this analysis is based on specific sales forecasts for each of our products 
information that we would consider in determining the forecast would include contractual obligations to deliver products  purchase orders with delivery dates or our knowledge of a specific order that would significantly alter the sales forecast 
return of property and equipment as of june   we had accrued in accounts payable million associated with the purchase of certain capital equipment from a vendor 
in connection with our evaluation of our manufacturing capacity needs  we determined that this new capital equipment was excess based on current anticipated production levels 
during the fiscal year ended june   we negotiated a settlement with the vendor whereby the vendor accepted the return of this equipment totaling million for a settlement fee of  accordingly  the reduction in accounts payable and fixed assets is reflected as a non cash item in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

table of contents merger fees 
in connection with the proposed merger between oplink and avanex corporation  which was not approved on august   at the special meeting of our stockholders  we incurred million in merger fees for the fiscal year ended june  in process research and development ip r d 
in connection with the acquisition of aurora in june  we recorded a  charge for ip r d in the fourth quarter of fiscal for products that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
these products included an ao variable optical attenuator which will regulate optical signals  a fiber optic bypass switch which will act as a temporary switch and can be used in conjunction with existing mechanical switches  a piao tunable filter which will be the first electronically chargeable filter  a portable optical spectrum analyzer which will view various wavelengths and indicate events on a real time basis  a dynamic fiber amplifier equalizer which will balance the signals inside the fiber before transmission to the amplifier  and a reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexer which will allow the user to electronically change ports  wavelengths and fiber on demand 
the value of the ip r d products was determined by estimating the net cash flows from the sale of the products resulting from the completion of this project  reduced by the portion of the net cash flows from the revenue attributable to core technology 
the resulting cash flows were then discounted back to their present value using a discount rate of 
at the time of the acquisition  the six products ranged from approximately to complete 
the fair value assigned to the in process research and development totaled  and was charged to expense at the time of the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition of telelight communication inc in april  we recorded a million charge for ip r d for products that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill of approximately  million and  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  represents charges incurred as a result of our acquisition of aurora in june and telelight in april we will not amortize goodwill in the future in accordance with the recent accounting pronouncement  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower yields on our cash investments  overall decreased cash balances from the use of cash in the fiscal year s loss in operations  investing outlays for capital purchases  financing outlays relating to repurchase of common stock  repayment of line of credit borrowings and repayment of capital lease obligations 
interest and other income  net increased million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in interest income was due to larger cash balances from the proceeds of our initial public offering in october  preferred stock financing in february and convertible note payable to cisco systems in august and was offset by the interest expense on the convertible note payable to cisco systems 
gain on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets increased million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the sale of excess fixed assets greater than the carrying amount of assets held for sale 
provision for income taxes 
at june  we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
because of certain changes in ownership of the company in and  there is an annual limitation of approximately  on the use of the net operating loss carryforwards pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
we have recorded a gross deferred tax asset of million as of june   which is net of a valuation allowance that reduces the gross deferred tax asset to zero  an amount that management believes will more likely than not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management recorded a valuation allowance to the extent we do not have a 
table of contents carryback right 
based on our history of losses and uncertainty of generating future taxable income  the realizable portion of the deferred tax assets is equal only to the amount of income tax expense expected to be paid during fiscal  which is zero  and represents the amount that we believe will more likely than not be realizable based on current available objective evidence 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents our operating results for the last eight quarters 
the information for each of these quarters is unaudited but has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements

table of contents the availability of raw materials used in our products and increases in the price of these raw materials  the ability of our manufacturing operations in china to timely produce and deliver products and components in the quantity and of the quality we require  our ability to achieve acceptable production yields in china  the practice of communication equipment suppliers to sporadically place large orders with short lead times  the mix of products and the average selling prices of the products we sell  competitive factors  including introductions of new products  new technologies and product enhancements by competitors  consolidation of competitors in the optical networking components market and pricing pressures  our ability to develop  introduce  manufacture and ship new and enhanced optical networking products in a timely manner without defects  and costs associated with and the outcomes of any intellectual property or other litigation to which we are  or may become  a party 
due to the factors noted above and other factors noted under risk factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance

during fiscal  we expect to use approximately million for capital expenditures worldwide 
we expect to use cash generated from our initial public offering for these expenditures

in fiscal and fiscal  our financing activities provided cash of million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash was primarily from the net proceeds from our initial public offering  proceeds from the convertible promissory note payable to cisco systems and issuance of our convertible preferred stock 
on september   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to an aggregate of million of our common stock 
such repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices  in negotiated transactions off the market or pursuant to a b plan adopted by the company 
in accordance with rule b under the securities exchange act  we adopted a plan in august which allows oplink to repurchase its shares during specified periods when we are likely to be in possession of material non public information 
as of june  repurchases of million have been made under the repurchase program 
our principal source of liquidity at june  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
our capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal we may use cash and cash equivalents from time to time to fund our acquisition of businesses and technologies 
we may be required to raise funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our ability to pursue our business strategy and achieve and maintain profitability

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates interest rate exposure the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
as of june   all of our investments were in money market funds  certificates of deposits  municipal bonds or high quality commercial paper with maturities of less than six month from the balance sheet date 
declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure we operate in the united states  manufacture in china  and substantially all sales to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we currently have no material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we expect our international revenues and expenses to be denominated predominately in us dollars 
certain expenses from our china operations are incurred in the chinese renminbi 
our china operations will expand in the future and account for a larger portion of our worldwide manufacturing and revenue 
we anticipate that we will experience the risks of fluctuating currencies due to this expansion and may choose to engage in currency hedging activities to reduce these risks
