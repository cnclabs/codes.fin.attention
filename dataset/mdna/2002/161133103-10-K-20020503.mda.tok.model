item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
as used herein  the terms fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal refer to our fiscal years ended february   february   and january   respectively 
fiscal consisted of weeks  while fiscal and fiscal each consisted of weeks 
forward looking statements with the exception of historical information  the matters contained in the following analysis and elsewhere in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements may include  but are not limited to  projections of revenues  income or loss  and capital expenditures  plans for future operations  and financing needs or plans  as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing 
the words expect  project  estimate  predict  anticipate  believes  and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified 
future events and actual results  performance  and achievements could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking statements 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect actual results or changes in or additions to the factors affecting such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause our actual results of operations or financial condition to differ from those described in this report include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following o our business is dependent upon our being able to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends  customer preferences and other fashion related factors  which we may not be able to successfully accomplish in the future 
o the general slowdown in the united states economy and the uncertain economic outlook has led to reduced consumer demand for our apparel and accessories and may continue to do so in the future 
o the women s specialty retail apparel industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
o we cannot assure the successful implementation of our business plan for increased profitability and growth in our plus sized women s apparel business 
o our business plan is largely dependent upon the continued growth in the plus sized women s apparel market which may not continue 
o we depend on key personnel  particularly our chief executive officer  dorrit j 
bern  and we may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
o we depend on our distribution centers and could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores if any of these distribution centers were to shut down for any reason 
o we depend for our working capital needs on the availability of credit  including credit we receive from our suppliers and their agents  and on our credit card securitization program 
if we were unable to obtain sufficient financing at affordable cost  our ability to merchandise our stores would be adversely affected 
o we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and face a variety of risks including political instability  imposition of duties or quotas  increased security requirements applicable to imports  delays in shipping  increased costs of transportation  and issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad 
o our stores experience seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income 
any decrease in sales or margins during our peak sales periods  or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding such periods  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  extreme or unseasonable weather conditions may have an impact on our sales 
o war  acts of terrorism  or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise  customer traffic to our stores and otherwise adversely impact our business 
o we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance for our operations at a reasonable cost 
o we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights  which we believe are important to our success and our competitive position 
o we may be unable to hire and retain suitable sales associates at our stores 
o we may be unable to successfully implement our restructuring plan described elsewhere in this report 
o our manufacturers may be unable to manufacture and deliver merchandise to us in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards 
o our sales are dependent upon a high volume of traffic in the strip centers and malls in which our stores are located and our future growth is dependent upon the availability of suitable locations for new stores 
o we may be unable to successfully integrate lane bryant into our current operating structure  and we currently rely on management information systems and logistics services from the limited with respect to our lane bryant stores 
critical accounting policies we have prepared the financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  analysis of current trends  and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we periodically reevaluate our accounting policies  assumptions  and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances warrant 
historically  actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  we consider the following accounting policies to be more critical to the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition our revenues from merchandise sales are net of returns and allowances and exclude sales tax 
we have adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  effective as of the beginning of fiscal as a result of adoption of sab  we established a reserve for estimated future sales returns based on an analysis of actual returns received following the end of each fiscal period and we began deferring recognition of layaway sales to the date of delivery 
a change in our actual rates of sales returns and layaway sales experience would affect the level of revenue recognized 
in fiscal  we began a customer loyalty card program for our fashion bug store customers 
the program provides discounts on customer purchases over a twelve month period upon payment of a annual fee 
we recognize revenues from card fees as sales over the life of the membership dependent upon discounts being earned by the customer 
if a customer does not earn discounts in an amount that exceeds the card fee  such difference is recognized as revenue upon the expiration of the annual period 
upon early cancellation of a loyalty card  refunds of membership fees are reduced by the amount of any discounts granted to the member under the program 
we recognize our costs of administering the program in cost of goods sold as incurred 
we offset revenues recognized from card fees by discounts granted under the program 
an increase in the level of refunds of membership fees could impact the level of revenue recognized 
inventories we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market under the retail inventory method average cost basis  which is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are adjusted in proportion to markdowns and shrinkage on our retail inventories 
the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
the rim calculation involves certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markup  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
events such as store closings  liquidations  and the general economic environment for retail apparel sales could result in an increase in the level of markdowns  which under the rim could result in lower inventory values and increases to cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in future periods 
in addition  failure to estimate markdowns currently can result in an overstatement of inventory cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
at the end of fiscal  for purposes of valuing our inventory  we recognized markdowns that had not been taken and which reduced inventories by approximately million 
in connection with our restructuring plan announced on january  see recent developments restructuring charges below  we recognized additional markdowns of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the markdowns were related to the valuation of inventory for the stores we expect to close during the first half of fiscal impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires us to assess these assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived tangible and intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
our estimation of fair value is generally based on either appraised value or measured by discounting future cash flows  based on a number of assumptions and estimates 
in connection with our restructuring plan announced on january  see recent developments restructuring charges below  we recognized a write down of store fixed assets of approximately million in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in determining this impairment charge are reasonable and appropriate 
at february   we evaluated the recoverability of goodwill and other long lived assets by comparing carrying values to undiscounted cash flows 
when we fully adopt sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal  impairment for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be determined by comparing carrying values and fair values 
indefinite lived intangible assets must be tested during the first quarter 
the initial step in testing goodwill must be completed by the end of the second quarter 
we currently believe that upon adoption of sfas no 
 we may be required to write down a significant portion of catherine s goodwill  which totaled million at the end of fiscal any such write down would be presented as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the fiscal consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
acquisitions purchase price allocation we allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we assign to all identifiable assets acquired  including intangible assets  and all identifiable liabilities assumed a portion of the cost of the acquired company equal to the estimated fair value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition 
we record the excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed as goodwill 
we make the initial purchase price allocation based on the evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements 
as final information regarding the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is evaluated and estimates are refined  we make appropriate adjustments to the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and change the amounts allocated to goodwill 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and  for major business acquisitions  typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
we have  if necessary  up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation 
asset securitizations we use an asset securitization program to fund substantially all of the credit card receivables generated by our fashion bug credit card program 
the fashion bug credit cards are issued by spirit of america national bank  one of our subsidiaries 
asset securitization is a practice commonly used in the retail industry which allows companies with proprietary credit card programs to finance credit card receivables at attractive rates 
asset securitization involves the sale of the bank s fashion bug proprietary credit card receivables to a special purpose entity  which in turn transfers the receivables to a qualified special purpose entity the trust which is administered by an independent trustee 
because the trust qualifies as a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  its assets and liabilities are not consolidated in our balance sheet 
the trust issues to investors various forms of certificates or credit card receivable interests the certificates that represent interests in the underlying trust assets 
the trust pays to the holders of certificates a portion of future scheduled cash flows under preset terms and conditions  the receipt of which is dependent upon cash flows generated by the underlying performance of the trust assets 
in each securitization transaction  we retain certain subordinated interests  which effectively serve as a form of credit enhancement to the certificates sold to outside investors 
to the extent amounts remain available after repayment to the outside investors  the amounts are paid to us 
neither the investors nor the trust have recourse against us beyond the combination of trust assets and our subordinated interests  other than for breaches of certain customary representations  warranties and covenants 
these representations  warranties  covenants and related indemnities do not protect the trust or the outside investors against credit related losses on the receivables 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  we record an interest in the estimated present value of cash flows to be received by us over the expected outstanding period of the receivables 
these cash flows essentially represent finance charges and past due fees in excess of the amounts paid to certificate holders and credit losses  and are referred to as the i o strip 
we use certain valuation assumptions related to the average lives of the receivables sold and anticipated credit losses  as well as the appropriate market discount rate  in determining the estimated present value of the i o strip 
changes in the average life of the receivables sold  loan payment rate  discount rate  and credit loss percentage could adversely impact the actual value of the i o strip 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from the estimates  and changes in circumstances could result in significant future changes to the assumptions currently being used

for fashion bug stores  improvements in junior sportswear were offset by declines in other merchandise categories 
in january  we announced plans to support growth in plus size apparel  and eliminated girls apparel from fashion bug stores effective at the end of the winter season 
sales of fashion bug girls apparel were approximately million during fiscal for catherine s stores  an increase in fiscal sales of casual sportswear was offset by declines in other merchandise categories 
in fiscal  we began a customer loyalty card program for our fashion bug store customers see critical accounting policies revenue recognition above 
we recognized million of revenues from card fees in connection with this program in fiscal cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy expenses were  million in fiscal  an increase of from  million in fiscal  principally reflecting the increase in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  these costs increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal reduced merchandise margins in our fashion bug and catherine s stores as a result of an increased level of promotional activity during fiscal  and costs related to exiting the girls business in our fashion bug stores  were partially offset by higher merchandise margins for our lane bryant stores and to a lesser extent by close management of in season inventory levels 
we include in cost of goods sold merchandise costs  net of discounts and allowances  freight  and inventory shrinkage 
net merchandise costs and freight are capitalized as inventory costs 
buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the lack of leverage on relatively fixed occupancy costs as a result of the decline in comparable store sales 
increased utilities expenses  relatively higher occupancy expenses for new and relocated stores as compared to our existing stores  and relatively higher occupancy expenses for our lane bryant stores also contributed to the increase in buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales 
buying expenses increased slightly as a percentage of net sales  primarily as a result of buying costs for lane bryant stores  which are relatively higher due to the product development and design process required to support a private label business 
buying expenses include payroll  payroll related costs  and operating expenses for our buying departments and warehouses 
occupancy expenses include rent  real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance  utilities  maintenance  and depreciation for our stores and warehouse facilities and equipment 
buying and occupancy costs are treated as period costs and are not capitalized as part of inventory

as a percentage of net sales  these costs increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal selling expenses increased as a percentage of net sales 
the relative increase was attributable to the lack of leverage on relatively fixed store payroll expenses as a result of the decline in comparable store sales 
an improvement in our credit operations which are included in selling expenses as a result of reduced interest rates related to our asset securitization program was partially offset by increased delinquencies in our proprietary credit card program during the latter part of fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal  primarily as a result of the synergistic effect of a larger sales base on corporate administrative expenses and the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives 
selling  general  and administrative expenses exclude goodwill amortization related to our acquisition of catherine s 
other income other income was million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in interest income 
interest income decreased as a result of lower levels of invested funds and a decrease in the average yield on investments during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  investments in marketable securities were converted into cash and cash equivalents  and we used million of cash and cash equivalents in connection with the acquisition of lane bryant 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of short term and long term borrowings incurred in connection with the lane bryant acquisition  and to a lesser extent  the result of additional long term mortgage borrowings and acquisitions of point of sale equipment under long term capital leases 
income tax provision benefit the income tax benefit for fiscal was thousand resulting in a effective tax rate  as compared to an income tax provision for fiscal of million  resulting in a effective tax rate

as a percentage of net sales  these costs decreased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the improvement in merchandise margins was primarily a result of the effect of relatively higher gross margins for our catherine s stores  although cost of goods sold for our fashion bug stores also decreased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal buying and occupancy expenses  expressed as a percentage of net sales  increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in buying and occupancy expenses was primarily a result of increased utilities expenses and relatively higher occupancy expenses for new and relocated stores as compared to our existing stores 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal  principally reflecting the acquisition of a large number of new stores in connection with the catherine s and modern woman transactions 
as a percentage of net sales  these costs increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the relative increase reflects relatively higher expenses for catherine s as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for the fashion bug stores were relatively unchanged as a percentage of net sales 
selling expenses were constant as a percentage of net sales 
increases in payroll costs were offset by lower marketing expenses as a percentage of sales and a reduction in the cost of our proprietary credit card program 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal  primarily as a result of the lack of sales leverage and relatively higher expenses for catherine s  which have been partially offset by improvements arising from the integration and consolidation of catherine s 
other income other income was million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal this increase was primarily caused by a decrease in net realized losses on sales of available for sale securities in fiscal as compared to fiscal during the second half of fiscal  we incurred realized losses from sales of available for sale securities to finance the catherine s and the modern woman acquisitions 
interest income also decreased as a result of reduced levels of available for sale securities during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of an increase in long term capital lease financing

included in the fiscal and fiscal tax provisions are million and million  respectively  related to one of our employee insurance programs 
the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is also the result of the non deductibility for tax purposes of goodwill related to our catherine s acquisition 
non recurring gain from demutualization of insurance company during fiscal  we received a stock distribution from one of our mutual insurance carriers in connection with the carrier s conversion to a publicly held corporation demutualization 
in accordance with the consensus reached in emerging issues task force issue no

as a percentage of net sales  these costs increased by in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal improvements in selling expense as a result of the net reduction in the cost of our proprietary credit card program and a decrease in store payroll expenses at our fashion bug and catherine s stores were offset by increased delinquencies in our proprietary credit card program and the negative effect of the lack of leverage on fixed expenses caused by the decline in comparable store sales 
recent developments acquisition of lane bryant on august   we acquired of the outstanding stock of lane bryant  inc from a subsidiary of the limited  inc 
for cash of million  including direct costs of the acquisition of million  and million shares of our common stock  valued at million 
as of the date of acquisition  lane bryant operated retail apparel stores in states  specializing in fashion apparel and related accessories for women wearing plus sizes and greater 
lane bryant had net sales of million in fiscal the cash we paid for the acquisition was funded with approximately million from our existing cash and cash equivalents  a million term loan  and revolving loans under a new credit facility obtained in connection with the acquisition 
based on a final determination of the value of the lane bryant net assets acquired  on december   we issued to a subsidiary of the limited an additional  shares of our common stock valued at million 
of the aggregate total of million shares issued to the limited  million shares had been previously held by us as treasury shares 
the limited  inc is restricted from selling our shares for one year after the close of the transaction 
we have accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting  and have included the results of operations of lane bryant in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
prior period results have not been restated 
concurrent with the acquisition of lane bryant  we began a detailed evaluation of lane bryant s operations  resulting in a plan for the closing of under performing lane bryant stores and the termination of approximately store employees 
as of february   we had finalized our plan to close the under performing stores and to terminate the store employees 
as a result  we recorded a liability of million as part of the purchase price allocation  which was primarily for estimated lease termination payments 
in addition  we recorded an accrual of thousand for severance of store employees 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a services agreement with the limited and certain of its affiliates under which we receive certain transitional services  including data center processing of lane bryant business applications such as store polling and support of store systems  continuation of contract services with vendors for voice and data networks  and conversion services  through october  we have begun moving all of the lane bryant business applications and processes from the limited to our platform and expect the transition to be completed by october  other transitional services provided by the limited have terms ranging from one month to months  and we expect to pay approximately million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  to the limited under these agreements 
the cost of the services to be provided by the limited is intended to approximate the limited s cost in providing the services 
we may terminate these agreements before their expiration dates with notice 
we also entered into a lease agreement with distribution land corp  an affiliate of the limited  under which lane bryant has leased a distribution center and office space near columbus  ohio for a period of three years 
the current monthly rental is thousand and is subject to annual consumer price index adjustments 
in addition  lane bryant subleased retail properties from the limited under a master sublease 
the stores subject to the master sublease had been operated as lane bryant stores before the acquisition 
we have guaranteed the obligations of lane bryant under the master sublease 
in connection with such guaranty  we agreed with the limited to certain limitations on our ability to incur debt  make distributions to our shareholders  and purchase our own shares 
these limitations will continue until the limited s liability for the leases falls below a certain level or in certain other circumstances 
restructuring charges closing conversion of the answer added dimension and fashion bug stores on january   we announced a restructuring plan  including a number of initiatives designed to position us for increased profitability and growth in the women s plus size apparel business 
the major components of the plan include the closing of the answer added dimensions chain of stores  including the conversion of approximately of the added dimensions stores to catherine s stores  the closing of under performing fashion bug stores  and the conversion of fashion bug store locations to lane bryant stores 
the restructuring plan resulted in a pre tax charge of million million after tax  or 
per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal the restructuring charge includes a million non cash write down of fixed assets primarily store fixtures and improvements in the stores to be closed  million of anticipated payments to landlords for the early termination of existing store leases  thousand for severance costs  and thousand for signage removal and other costs 
the fixtures and improvements have no alternative use or salvage value  and we expect them to be scrapped when the stores are closed 
our estimate of anticipated lease termination payments is based on our prior experience 
however  the actual payment amount will depend on the results of our negotiations with many landlords  which could result in future adjustments to this estimate 
we do not expect that any such adjustments would be material 
our estimated net after tax cash cost of the restructuring is approximately million 
our balance sheet at february  reflects the fixed asset write down and the accrued lease termination  severance  and other costs 
we expect to substantially complete the restructuring plan by the end of fiscal and anticipate that this will thereafter improve our annualized pre tax earnings by approximately million 
because a majority of the store closings will occur during the second half of fiscal  the full impact of the completion of the restructuring plan is expected to first benefit the fiscal year ending january  store restructuring and elimination of men s merchandise from fashion bug stores on march   our board of directors approved a restructuring plan that resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
the plan was approved in conjunction with the decision to eliminate men s merchandise from our fashion bug stores 
we closed stores and downsized stores in connection with the plan 
elimination of the men s merchandise from the stores was completed in october  the balance of the men s inventory was sold  and the selling space used for men s merchandise was re merchandised 
in fiscal  we determined that of the stores originally included in the plan would remain open as a result of negotiations with landlords and changes in economic conditions 
as a result  we reversed reserves related to these stores and recognized a pre tax restructuring credit of million in fiscal this restructuring plan was completed as of february   and there are no remaining restructure accruals relating to this plan 
the restructuring charge included a million write off of the carrying value of fixtures and improvements in the stores to be reduced in size or closed 
the fixtures and improvements had no alternative use or salvage value  and were expected to be scrapped at the time of the closing or downsizing of the stores 
the restructuring charge also included accruals for anticipated payments to landlords for the early termination of existing store leases of million  severance payments of thousand  costs to remove store signs and entrances of million  costs of supplies to be scrapped of thousand  and legal and architectural fees of thousand 
the accrual for severance payments was for store employees expected to be terminated as a result of the store closings 
the number of employees actually terminated was reduced to as a result of the stores that remained open  as discussed above  and the excess severance accrual was reversed as part of the restructuring credit of million recognized in fiscal during fiscal  we closed one store and completed the downsizing of stores in connection with the plan 
distribution center restructuring on december   our board of directors approved a plan to close our bensalem  pennsylvania distribution center and sell the facility 
the plan was approved in conjunction with the decision to consolidate the bensalem distribution center operations into our greencastle  indiana distribution center 
the plan resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of million during fiscal the restructuring charge included a million write down of the cost of the bensalem facilities from a carrying value of million to a net realizable value of million  based on an independent appraisal 
the restructuring charge also included an accrual of million for severance costs resulting from the termination of warehouse and distribution personnel and eleven management employees 
in addition  the restructuring charge included an accrual of thousand for incremental warehouse handling costs  outplacement services for terminated employees  legal fees related to the sale of the facility  and other non recurring costs relating to the closure 
the bensalem distribution center closed on december   and we completed the sale of the bensalem facility during fiscal upon completion of the sale of the facility  we recognized a pre tax restructuring credit of million in fiscal  which primarily represented sales proceeds in excess of the estimated net realizable value of the bensalem facility 
as of february   this restructuring plan has been completed  and there are no remaining restructure accruals relating to this plan 
closing of modern woman stores during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in connection with our acquisitions of modern woman and catherine s 
at the time of the catherine s acquisition  we had planned to consolidate modern woman stores into the catherine s division 
the restructuring charge was primarily for lease termination costs related to the closing of eleven modern woman stores that geographically overlapped catherine s stores 
during fiscal  we closed ten of the eleven stores  and paid lease termination costs of million related to the closed stores 
as of february   thousand of accrued restructuring charges related to the remaining store were unpaid 
we closed the remaining store during fiscal  utilizing the remaining accrual 
other recent developments on september   major terrorist attacks occurred against the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon in washington  dc these attacks adversely affected the united states economy  which was already slowing and showing signs of a recession before september  we did not experience any direct instances of destruction or impairment of our assets 
however  many strip centers and malls in which we have stores were closed  in some cases for more than one day  and since then the government has reported threats of further attacks against united states locations including malls 
we believe that the effects of the terrorist incidents had an adverse impact on our results of operations during fiscal financial condition liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operations  our proprietary credit card receivables securitization agreements  our investment portfolio  and our credit facilities described below 
the following table highlights certain information related to our liquidity and capital resources fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents    available for sale securities    cash provided by operating activities 
   working capital    current ratio long term debt to equity ratio our cash provided by operating activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  from million to million

s 
government agency bonds with early redemption provisions were called for redemption during the first half of fiscal the decrease in available for sale securities during fiscal was primarily a result of these redemptions

earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization and excluding non recurring gains increased by million from fiscal to fiscal  from million to million 
this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of catherine s and modern woman in fiscal a reduced level of growth in inventories from fiscal to fiscal was substantially offset by increased payments of prepaid and accrued expenses

during fiscal and fiscal  pursuant to a program to replace our existing point of sale pos equipment  we acquired million and million  respectively  of pos equipment for our fashion bug and catherine s stores under capital leases 
these leases generally have an initial lease term of months and contain a bargain purchase option 
during fiscal  we re negotiated the terms of certain of our existing pos equipment capital leases 
the re negotiated leases were combined into a new lease with a month term and a lower interest rate 
the effect of the re negotiation was a net decrease increase in total lease payments as follows fiscal thousand  fiscal thousand  fiscal thousand  fiscal thousand  fiscal thousand  fiscal million 
at february   our commitments for future principal payments under our short term and long term debt obligations  and minimum lease payments under our capital leases and operating leases  were as follows fiscal year ended in millions thereafter short term debt long term debt capital leases operating leases total commitments under operating leases include million payable under the lane bryant master sublease with the limited  which we have guaranteed 
we are currently analyzing our existing distribution network  and we are considering whether to purchase or lease an additional distribution center  either of which alternatives would require additional capital expenditures and will require approval under our existing credit arrangements 
we are also presently evaluating various alternatives to our current capital structure  including whether to refinance a portion of our existing long term debt 
there can be no assurance as to the terms and conditions of any such refinancing or whether any such refinancing will be accomplished 
we have formed a trust called the charming shoppes master trust to which spirit of america national bank  our credit card bank  has transferred through a special purpose entity its interest in credit card receivables created under our fashion bug proprietary credit card program 
we  together with the trust  have entered into various agreements under which the trust can sell  on a revolving basis  interests in these receivables for a specified term 
when the revolving period terminates  an amortization period begins during which principal payments are made to the parties with whom the trust has entered into the securitization agreement 
we securitized million and million of credit card receivables in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and had million of securitized credit card receivables outstanding as of february  we held retained interests in our securitizations of million as of the end of fiscal  which were generally subordinated in right of payment to certificates issued by the trust to third party investors 
our obligation to repurchase receivables sold to the trust is limited to those receivables that  at the time of their transfer  fail to meet the trust s eligibility standards under normal representations and warranties 
to date  we have repurchased only a small amount of receivables pursuant to this obligation 
a securitization series in the aggregate principal amount of million is scheduled to mature prior to the end of fiscal we are currently considering various alternatives to replace this series 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in securing such replacement financing 
charming shoppes receivables corp 
and charming shoppes seller  inc  our consolidated wholly owned indirect subsidiaries  are separate special purpose entities created for the securitization program 
at february   charming shoppes receivables corp 
held million of charming shoppes master trust certificates which are included in the million of retained interests we held at february  and charming shoppes seller  inc held retained interests of million 
these assets are first and foremost available to satisfy the claims of the respective creditors of these separate corporate entities  including certain claims of investors in the charming shoppes master trust 
we could be affected by certain events that would cause the trust to require additional enhancement from proceeds within the trust that would otherwise be available to be paid to us with respect to our subordinated interests 
specifically  if either we or the trust fail to meet certain financial performance standards  a credit enhancement condition would occur and the trust would be required to retain amounts otherwise payable to us 
during fiscal  credit card receivable credit loss percentages exceeded a specified threshold percentage  which obligates the trust to accumulate million into such an enhancement account  which if not required to be paid to the other certificate holders  will be available to us at the termination of the securitization series 
as of february   the charming shoppes master trust had million segregated for such additional enhancement purposes 
we do not expect the requirement to materially affect our liquidity or results of operations 
we have no obligation to directly fund these enhancement accounts of the trust  other than for breaches of customary representations  warranties and covenants 
these representations  warranties  covenants and related indemnities do not protect the trust or investors in the trust against credit related losses on the receivables 
the providers of the credit enhancements and trust investors have no other recourse to us 
these securitization agreements are intended to improve our overall liquidity by providing short term sources of funding 
the agreements provide that we will continue to service the credit card receivables and control credit policies 
this control allows us  absent certain adverse events  to fund continued credit card receivable growth and to provide the appropriate customer service and collection activities 
accordingly  our relationship with our credit card customers is not affected by these agreements

the credit facility also requires  among other things  that we not pay dividends on our common stock and  under certain circumstances  that we maintain an adjusted tangible net worth of million subject to adjustment 
in january  we amended the new credit facility in connection with our restructuring plan 
until the term loan is paid in full  the credit facility requires that we maintain a minimum twelve month earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization  as adjusted pursuant to the terms of the credit facility and to account for the acquisition of lane bryant adjusted ebitda of million for fiscal and million through the end of fiscal thereafter  until the term loan is paid in full  the credit facility requires that we maintain a twelve month adjusted ebitda of million 
until the term loan is paid in full  the credit facility also requires that we maintain a ratio of total secured debt to adjusted ebitda of not greater than to as of february   to at the end of the first quarter of fiscal  decreasing to to at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  and increasing to to at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter 
as of the end of fiscal  we were not in violation of any of the covenants included in the credit facility 
in november  we borrowed million under a mortgage note 
the mortgage note has a ten year term with monthly installments of principal and interest of thousand commencing in january  and a final payment of any remaining unpaid principal and interest in december the mortgage note is secured by our land  buildings  fixtures  and equipment in bensalem  pennsylvania and by leases and rents owned or received by us from tenants of the bensalem facility

in july  we completed a public offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes are redeemable  at our option  at of principal through july  and at declining prices thereafter  decreasing to on or after july  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  under certain circumstances involving a change in control 
there is no sinking fund for the notes

market risk we manage our fashion bug proprietary credit card program through various operating entities that we own 
the primary activity of these entities is to service our proprietary credit card portfolio  the balances of which we sell under a credit card securitization program 
under the securitization program  we can be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent that the interest rates charged to our customers vary from the rates paid on certificates issued by the trust 
until november  the credit card program billed finance charges based on a fixed rate 
as of november  finance charges on all accounts are billed using a floating rate index the prime lending rate  subject to a floor and limited by legal maximums 
the floating rate index on all of the certificates is either one month libor or the commercial paper rate  depending on the issuance 
consequently  we have reduced our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
however  we have exposure in the movement of basis risk between the floating rate index on the certificates and the prime rate 
as of february   the floating rate finance charge rate was below the contractual floor rate  thus exposing us to a portion of interest rate risk 
to the extent that short term interest rates were to increase by one percentage point by the end of fiscal  an increase of approximately thousand in selling  general  and administrative expenses would result 
as of february   only our borrowings of million under our credit facility were exposed to variable interest rates 
an increase in market interest rates will increase our interest expense and decrease our cash flows 
a decrease in market interest rates will decrease our interest expense and increase our cash flows 
we are not subject to material foreign exchange risk  as our foreign transactions are primarily us dollar denominated and our foreign operations do not constitute a material part of our business
