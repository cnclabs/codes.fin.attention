medtox scientific  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  medtox laboratories  inc  medtox diagnostics  inc  and new brighton business center llc are referred to herein as the company 
the company is engaged primarily in two distinct  but very much related businesses 
the business of manufacturing and distribution of diagnostic devices is carried on by medtox diagnostics  inc from its facility in burlington  north carolina and the business of forensic and clinical laboratory services is conducted by medtox laboratories  inc at its facility in st 
paul  minnesota

for the years ended december    and  laboratory services revenue accounted for  and of the company s revenues  respectively 
revenue from product sales accounted for  and of the total revenues of the company for the years ended december   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item on form k  beginning on page note that the preparation of this form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by management s review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s general expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have occurred in the past 
the company s consolidated trade accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
off site supplies inventory off site supplies represents collection kits and forms located at collections sites throughout the united states used by laboratory services customers to submit specimens for testing services 
at december   off site inventory was million 
the process for estimating off site inventory involves significant assumptions and judgments 
the estimate is based on the historical average time that a collection site uses the inventory  as well as the amount of inventory expected to be scrapped 
goodwill the company continually evaluates whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss of unamortized goodwill 
the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of unamortized goodwill include a significant  sustained negative trend in operating results or cash flows  a decrease in demand for the company s products or services  a change in the competitive environment  and other industry and economic factors 
the company measures impairment of unamortized goodwill utilizing the undiscounted cash flow method 
the estimated cash flows are then compared to recorded goodwill amounts  if the unamortized balance of the goodwill exceeds the estimated cash flows  the excess of the unamortized balance is written off 
as of december   the company determined that there has been no impairment of goodwill 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company will assess the impact based on a two step approach to assess goodwill based on applicable reporting units and will reassess any intangible assets  including goodwill  recorded in connection with previous acquisitions 
the company recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization during and would have recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization during in lieu of amortization  the company will be required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the company is currently assessing  but has not yet determined  the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on its consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company had unamortized goodwill of million 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company increases or decreases the valuation allowance in a period  the company must include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company has recorded a full valuation allowance of million due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize the deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses nol carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on management s estimate of taxable income primarily determined from four year cumulative historical results and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
it is possible that the company could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will realize all or a portion of the nol carryforward 
upon reaching such a conclusion  the company would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to the company s combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate under current tax rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although the company s cash payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized 
results of operations in  the company achieved record revenues and net income  driven by sales of the profile r test systems and the expanding verdict r ii product line  and an increase in volume from specialty laboratory testing services 
gross margin improved due to the company s continued focus on higher margin products and testing 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales reflecting continued efforts to reduce operating costs 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling  general  and administrative research and development restructuring costs other expense  primarily interest net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million in  driven by a million  or increase in product sales revenues and a million  or increase in laboratory services revenues 
the growth in laboratory services was primarily due to a increase in the company s specialty laboratory services revenues 
this increase is due to the expansion of clinical testing for the pharmaceutical industry and the october acquisition of leadtech corporation leadtech  a pediatric lead testing laboratory 
the company s research and development group continues to improve and add to the over proprietary bio analytical assays that have been developed 
in the past  these tests have largely been marketed to hospitals  clinics and other laboratories 
however  in  the company has increased its efforts to apply the assay development skills to the bio analytical needs of the pharmaceutical market 
specimen volume growth from the occupational health and corporate clients was relatively flat in the slowing economy and the impact of the tragic events occurring on september  caused volume from existing occupational health and corporate clients to be below expectations 
however  this impact has been largely mitigated by the company s continued success in acquiring new client relationships and gaining market share 
the company believes that the current lower volume from existing clients will continue to be offset by successful sales efforts to new clients 
the product sales segment achieved higher sales due to increased sales of substance abuse testing products  partially offset by decreased sales of agricultural diagnostic products 
product sales from substance abuse testing products  which incorporates the ez screen r  profile r ii  profile r er and verdict r ii on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances  increased million to million in this growth reflected the sales and marketing efforts for the company s second generation test kits  profile r ii  profile r er and verdict r ii 
the profile r er device is an on site  nine drugs of abuse panel  targeted at hospital laboratories for emergency response screening in drugs of abuse overdose situations 
the company received fda approval for its profile r er device and for configurations of its verdict r ii product in january the verdict r ii was developed for the prison  probation  parole and rehabilitation markets 
the verdict r ii product line now consists of different configurations to detect from one to seven drugs of abuse 
the company continues to develop new products in this area  including the profile iia r device which was introduced in november the profile iia r device screens for five drugs of abuse and uses a unique lateral flow test strip to screen for the five most common adulterants 
sales of contract manufacturing services  microbiological and associated products remained flat at million in both and product sales from agricultural diagnostic products decreased to million primarily as a result of decreased purchases by the us department of agriculture usda for the company s products 
the usda s needs for the company s products vary from year to year and sales to the usda are expected to fluctuate accordingly
