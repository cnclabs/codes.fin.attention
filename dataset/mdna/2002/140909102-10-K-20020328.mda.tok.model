item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a major manufacturer of recycled paperboard and converted paperboard products 
we operate in three business segments 
the paperboard segment manufactures recycled uncoated and clay coated paperboard and collects recycled paper and brokers recycled paper and other paper rolls 
the tube  core and composite container segment produces spiral and convolute wound tubes  cores and cans 
the carton and custom packaging segment produces printed and unprinted folding and set up cartons and provides contract manufacturing and packaging services 
our business is vertically integrated to a large extent 
this means that our converting operations consume a large portion of our own paperboard production  approximately in the remaining of our paperboard production is sold to external customers in any of the four recycled paperboard end use markets tube  core and composite containers  folding cartons  gypsum wallboard facing paper and other specialty products 
we are the only major manufacturer to serve all four end use markets 
as part of our strategy to maintain optimum levels of production capacity  we regularly purchase paperboard from other manufacturers in an effort to minimize the potential impact of demand declines on our own mill system 
additionally  each of our mills can produce recycled paperboard for more than one end use market 
this allows us to shift production between mills in response to customer or market demands 
recovered fiber  which is derived from recycled paper stock  is our most significant raw material 
historically  the cost of recovered fiber has fluctuated significantly due to market and industry conditions 
for example  our average recovered fiber cost per ton of paperboard produced increased from per ton in to per ton in  an increase of  before dropping to per ton in same mill recovered fiber cost per ton averaged and during and  respectively 
we raise our selling prices in response to increases in raw material costs 
however  we often are unable to pass the full amount of these costs through to our customers on a timely basis  and as a result often cannot maintain our operating margins in the face of dramatic cost increases 
we experience margin shrinkage during all periods of price increases due to customary time lags in implementing our price increases 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover any future increases in the cost of recovered fiber by raising the prices of our products 
even if we are able to recover future cost increases  our operating margins and results of operations may still be materially and adversely affected by time delays in the implementation of price increases 
excluding labor  energy is our most significant manufacturing cost 
energy is used to generate steam used in the paper making process and to operate our paperboard machines and all of our other converting machinery 
our energy costs increased steadily throughout and the first quarter of before showing some improvement by the end of in  the average energy cost in our mill system was approximately per ton 
in  energy costs increased to approximately per ton 
the increase was due primarily to increases in natural gas and fuel oil costs 
until recently  our business had not been significantly affected by energy costs  and we historically have not passed increases in energy costs through to our customers 
consequently  we were not able to pass through to our customers all of the energy cost increases we incurred in and as a result  our operating margins were adversely affected 
we continue to evaluate our energy costs and consider ways to factor energy costs into our pricing 
however  we cannot assure you that our operating margins and results of operations will not continue to be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
historically  we have grown our business  revenues and production capacity to a significant degree through acquisitions 
based on the difficult operating climate for our industry and our financial position  the pace of our acquisition activity  and accordingly  our revenue growth  has slowed as we have focused on conserving cash and maximizing the productivity of our existing facilities 
we made no acquisitions in we are a holding company that currently operates our business through subsidiaries 
we also own a interest in two joint ventures with temple inland  inc we have an additional joint venture with an unrelated entity of which our investment and share of earnings of this venture is immaterial 
we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting 
critical accounting policies our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause future reported financial condition and results to differ materially from financial results reported based on management s current estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
inventory 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management frequently reviews inventory to determine the necessity of reserves for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have over or under stated the reserve required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
impairment of goodwill 
we periodically evaluate acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
evaluating the impairment of goodwill also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows which also require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
self insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
consulting actuaries and administrators assist us in determining our liability for self insured claims 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses carried forward and state tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense  recorded obligation and funding requirements in future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our future expense 
results of operations the following table shows volume  gross paper margins and related data for the periods indicated 
the volume information shown below includes shipments of unconverted paperboard and converted paperboard products 
tonnage volumes from our business segments  excluding tonnage produced or converted by our unconsolidated joint ventures  are combined and presented along end use market lines

our consolidated sales for the year ended december  decreased to million from  million in acquisitions completed during accounted for million of sales during these acquisitions included milpak  inc  arrow paper products company and crane carton company  llc 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and their results of operations were included only from and after the date of the acquisition 
excluding acquisitions completed during  sales decreased during this decrease was due to lower selling prices and volume from the paperboard and the tube  core and composite container segments  partially attributable to the dispute with georgia pacific see georgia pacific litigation below  along with lower selling prices from the carton and custom packaging segment due to competitive pressures 
the decline in volume from the tube  core and composite container segment was primarily attributable to the downturn in the textile industry 
total paperboard tonnage for decreased to  thousand tons from  thousand tons in excluding acquisitions completed during  total paperboard tonnage declined to thousand tons 
this decrease was primarily due to lower shipments of unconverted paperboard to external customers combined with lower internal conversion by our converting operations in the other specialty products and the tube  core and composite container markets 
the decrease in shipments of unconverted paperboard was due primarily to a decline in industry demand and partially attributable to the dispute with georgia pacific 
excluding acquisitions  outside purchases decreased to thousand tons 
tons sold from paperboard mill production decreased for to thousand tons  compared with thousand tons for total tonnage converted decreased for to thousand tons compared to thousand tons in  and decreased from  excluding acquisitions 
excluding acquisitions completed during  volumes in the folding carton and tube  core and composite container end use markets decreased and  respectively 
gross margin 
gross margin for increased to of sales from in excluding the million reduction in reserves related to expiring unfavorable supply contracts at the sprague paperboard mill  gross margin was for this margin decrease was due primarily to lower margins in the carton and custom packaging and tube  core and composite container segments  partially offset by improved margins in the paperboard segment 
margins decreased in the carton and custom packaging segment due to lower selling prices resulting from competitive pressures 
margins in the tube  core and composite container segment decreased as a result of lower selling prices  higher paperboard costs and a decline in the textile industry 
the improved margins in the paperboard segment were the result of cost cutting efforts to reduce expenses combined with the substantial decline in fiber costs  which were partially offset by the decline in selling prices and the increase in energy costs 
restructuring and other nonrecurring costs 
in january  we initiated a plan to close our paperboard mill located in chicago  illinois and recorded a pretax charge to operations of approximately million 
the mill was profitable through  but declining sales resulted in losses of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
we expect the proceeds from the sale of the real estate to more than offset the pretax charge 
the million charge included a million noncash asset impairment write down of fixed assets to estimated net realizable value  a million accrual for severance and termination benefits for salaried and hourly employees terminated in connection with this plan and a thousand accrual for other exit costs 
during  we paid million in severance and termination benefits and thousand in other exit costs 
the remaining other exit costs will be paid by december  as of december   one employee remained to assist in the closing of the mill 
we are marketing the property and will complete the exit plan upon the sale of the property  which we anticipate will occur prior to december  in march  we initiated a plan to consolidate the operations of our salt lake city  utah carton plant into our denver  colorado carton plant and recorded a pretax charge to operations of approximately million 
the million charge included a million noncash asset impairment write down of fixed assets to estimated net realizable value  a thousand accrual for severance and termination benefits for salaried and hourly employees terminated in connection with this plan and a thousand accrual for other exit costs 
all exit costs were paid as of december  as of december   no employees remained at the plant 
in february  we initiated a plan to close our paperboard mill located in baltimore  maryland and recorded a pretax charge to operations of approximately million 
we adopted the plan to close the mill in conjunction with our ongoing efforts to increase manufacturing efficiency and reduce costs in our mill system 
the million charge included a million noncash asset impairment charge to write down machinery and equipment to estimated net realizable value 
the charge also included a thousand accrual for severance and termination benefits for salaried and hourly employees terminated in connection with this plan and a thousand accrual for other exit costs 
all exit costs were paid by december  as of december   one employee remained to assist in marketing the land and building 
we will complete the exit plan upon the sale of the property  which we anticipate will occur prior to december  the mill closure did not have a material impact on our operations 
in september  we initiated a plan to close our paperboard mill located in camden  new jersey and recorded a pretax charge to operations of approximately million 
the mill experienced a slowdown in gypsum facing paper shipments during the third quarter of  and the shutdown was precipitated by the refusal of georgia pacific  formerly our largest gypsum facing paper customer  to continue purchasing facing paper under a long term supply agreement 
the million charge included a million noncash asset impairment write down of fixed assets to estimated net realizable value  a thousand accrual for severance and termination benefits for salaried and hourly employees terminated in connection with this plan  and a thousand accrual for other exit costs 
during and  we paid thousand and thousand  respectively  in severance and termination benefits and thousand and thousand  respectively  in other exit costs 
the remaining other exit costs will be paid by june  as of december   no employees remained at the mill 
we are marketing the property and will complete the exit plan upon the sale of the property  which we anticipate will occur prior to december  this mill contributed sales and operating income of million and million  respectively  for the nine months ended september  and million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  in december  we recognized a nonrecurring cost of million related to the settlement of a dispute over abandoned property 
operating income 
operating income for was million  a decrease of million  or from operating income excluding the sprague reserve reduction  restructuring charges and acquisitions was million for  a decrease of million  or  from operating income of million in  excluding restructuring charges and other nonrecurring costs 
this decline was due primarily to lower volume in the tube  core and composite container and paperboard segments  partially attributable to the dispute with georgia pacific  and lower margins in the carton and custom packaging and tube  core and composite container segments 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in compared to  but decreased million  or  excluding acquisitions 
this decrease was primarily due to mill closures in the paperboard segment 
other income expense 
interest expense increased to million for from million in this increase was due to higher outstanding debt balances at higher interest rates  partially offset by savings from interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted portions of our fixed rate notes into variable rate obligations 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our debt  interest expense and interest rate swap agreements 
equity in loss from unconsolidated affiliates was million in  down million from equity in income of million in this decrease was primarily due to lower operating results for standard gypsum  lp  our gypsum wallboard joint venture with temple inland 
the lower results were due primarily to significantly lower selling prices in compared to due to excess capacity in that market 
net income loss 
as discussed above  our results for included restructuring charges recorded in conjunction with the closing of our chicago  illinois paperboard mill and the consolidation of operations of our salt lake city  utah carton plant into our denver  colorado carton plant 
these charges were million in the aggregate million  net of tax benefit  or per common share on a diluted basis 
also included in the results for was an extraordinary loss of million related to the early extinguishment of debt million  net of tax benefit  or per common share on a diluted basis 
partially offsetting these charges was the million reduction in reserves related to expiring unfavorable supply contracts at the sprague paperboard mill million  net of tax provision  or per common share on a diluted basis 
excluding the extraordinary loss  restructuring charges and the sprague reserve reduction  net loss in was million  or net loss per common share on a diluted basis  compared to net income before restructuring charges and other nonrecurring costs of million  or net income per common share on a diluted basis  in including the extraordinary loss  restructuring charges  other nonrecurring costs and the sprague reserve reduction  net loss was million in  or net loss per common share on a diluted basis  compared with net income of million  or net income per common share on a diluted basis  in events of september  the horrific terrorist attacks against the united states and their aftermath did not  during  and are not currently expected to  have a direct material effect on our operations 
however  to the extent that those events  other terrorist activities  the us military response and the resulting uncertainties have adversely affected  or will continue to adversely affect  the united states economy in general  sectors on which we depend in particular  and the us capital markets  our results of operations  financial condition and stock price have been  and could continue to be  adversely affected

operating income 
operating income for was million  a decrease of million  or  from operating income for comparable facilities  excluding restructuring and other nonrecurring costs  declined million  or 
this decline was due primarily to lower volume and higher energy costs in the paperboard segment  combined with lower margins in the carton and custom packaging and tube  core and composite container segments 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in compared to acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the increase and information technology costs accounted for approximately million of the increase 
other income expense 
interest expense increased to million for from million in due to higher average borrowings under our senior credit facility and the effect of a full year of interest expense attributable to our million public debt securities offering in june equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates was million  down million  or  from primarily due to lower operating results for standard gypsum  lp  our gypsum wallboard joint venture with temple inland  inc and start up costs at premier boxboard limited llc  our containerboard mill joint venture with temple inland 
net income 
as discussed above  our results for included restructuring and nonrecurring charges recorded in conjunction with the closings of our baltimore  maryland and camden  new jersey paperboard mills and a nonrecurring charge related to the settlement of a dispute over abandoned property  which were million in the aggregate million  net of tax benefit  or per common share on a diluted basis 
excluding these charges  net income was million  or per common shares on a diluted basis 
including the restructuring and other nonrecurring costs  net income decreased to million from million in diluted net income per common share  including the restructuring and other nonrecurring costs  decreased to for from in liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources and risks 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under the various debt facilities described below 
downturns in operations can significantly affect our ability to generate cash 
for example  in the difficult operating climate we experienced in  we generated million less cash from operations than we did in factors that can affect our operating results are discussed further in this report under risk factors in part i  item however  despite the lower operating cash flow in  we managed to improve our year end cash position by million over due primarily to conservative cash management 
we also believe that our existing cash and liquidity position will be further strengthened through the sale of the real estate at our baltimore  maryland  camden  new jersey and chicago  illinois paperboard mills  which we anticipate will occur in additionally  we expect to receive a federal tax refund of approximately million in the first half of if  however  we were to face unexpected liquidity needs  we could require additional funds from external sources such as our senior credit facility 
the availability of liquidity from borrowings is primarily affected by our continued compliance with the terms of the debt agreements governing these facilities  including the payment of interest and compliance with various covenants and financial maintenance tests 
in addition  as described below under joint venture financings  to the extent we are unable to comply with financial maintenance tests under our senior credit facility  we will fail to comply with identical financial maintenance covenant tests under our guarantees of the credit facilities of our joint ventures  which could potentially materially and adversely affect us through a series of cross defaults under both our joint ventures and our own obligations if we were unable to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments with respect to the underlying violations and any related cross defaults 
at december  and december   we were not in compliance with the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio  respectively  under both our senior credit facility and our joint venture guarantees  but in each case were able to obtain appropriate amendments and waivers with respect to each instance of non compliance and with respect to any technical cross default 
absent further material deterioration of the us economy as a whole or the specific sectors on which our business depends see part i  item  risk factors our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by downturns in industrial production  housing and construction and the consumption of durable and nondurable goods  we believe it is unlikely that we will breach our covenants under our debt agreements or joint venture guarantees during we also believe that in the event of such a breach due to a further deterioration in economic or industry conditions  our lenders would provide us with the necessary waivers and amendments 
however  we cannot assure you that we will achieve our expected future operating results or continued compliance with our debt covenants  or that  in such event  necessary waivers and amendments would be available at all or on acceptable terms 
if our debt or that of our joint ventures were placed in default  or if we were called upon to satisfy our joint venture guarantees  our liquidity and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
borrowings 
at december  and  total debt consisting of current maturities of debt  senior credit facility  and other long term debt  as reported on our consolidated balance sheets was as follows in thousands senior credit facility  senior subordinated notes  senior notes  senior notes   senior notes  other notes payable   total debt   on march   we completed a series of financing transactions pursuant to which we i issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due may  and million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due april   ii used the proceeds from these notes to repay in full our former senior credit facility and senior notes  and iii obtained a new million senior credit facility 
the senior notes and senior subordinated notes were issued at a discount to yield effective interest rates of and  respectively 
aggregate proceeds from the sale of these notes  net of issuance costs  was approximately million 
in connection with the repayment of the senior notes  we incurred a prepayment penalty of approximately million 
we recorded an extraordinary loss of million which includes the prepayment penalty and unamortized issuance costs of thousand  net of tax benefit of million 
the difference between issue price and principal amount at maturity of our senior notes and senior subordinated notes will be accreted each year as interest expense in our financial statements 
these notes are unsecured  but are guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by all of our domestic subsidiaries  other than one that is not wholly owned 
our credit facility provides for a revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of million for a term of three years  including subfacilities of million for swingline loans and million for letters of credit  usage of which reduces availability under the facility 
no borrowings were outstanding under the facility as of december   versus million outstanding on our former senior credit facility on december   however  an aggregate of million in letter of credit obligations were outstanding on december  we intend to use the facility for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
although the facility is unsecured  our obligations under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by all of our existing and subsequently acquired wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option  either the base rate which is equal to the greater of the prime rate most recently announced by bank of america  na  the administrative agent under the facility  or the federal funds rate plus one half of or the adjusted eurodollar interbank offered rate  in each case plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our leverage ratio which is defined under the facility as the ratio of our total debt to our total capitalization 
based on our leverage ratio at december   the current margins are for eurodollar rate loans and for base rate loans 
additionally  the undrawn portion of the facility is subject to a facility fee at an annual rate that is currently set at based on our leverage ratio at december  the facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability and our subsidiaries ability to create liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  incur indebtedness and guarantees  pay dividends  repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness  make certain investments or acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  make capital expenditures or change the nature of our business 
the facility also contains several financial maintenance covenants  including covenants establishing a maximum leverage ratio as described above  minimum tangible net worth and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the facility contains events of default including  but not limited to  nonpayment of principal or interest  violation of covenants  incorrectness of representations and warranties  cross default to other indebtedness  bankruptcy and other insolvency events  material judgments  certain erisa events  actual or asserted invalidity of loan documentation and certain changes of control of our company 
during the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of  we completed three amendments to our senior credit facility agreement 
the first amendment  dated september   allows us to acquire up to million of our senior subordinated notes so long as no default or event of default exists on the date of the transaction or will result from the transaction 
the second amendment  dated november   provides for the issuance of letters of credit under the senior credit facility having an original expiration date more than one year from the date of issuance  if required under related industrial revenue bond documents and agreed to by the issuing lender 
see subsequent events below  which details the third amendment to the senior credit facility 
this amendment was completed on january  with an effective date of september  we obtained this amendment in order to avoid the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facility agreement resulting from a violation of the interest coverage ratio covenant contained in this agreement 
in  we registered with the sec a total of million in public debt securities for issuance in one or more series and with such specific terms as determined from time to time 
on june   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due june  our senior notes were issued at a discount to yield an effective interest rate of  are unsecured obligations of our company and pay interest semiannually 
in connection with the offering of our senior notes and senior subordinated notes  our subsidiary guarantors also guaranteed our senior notes 
as noted above  on march   we repaid in full all outstanding balances under our former senior credit facility and senior notes 
our former senior credit facility was a million  five year senior credit facility with a scheduled maturity date in july interest under the facility was computed using our choice of a the adjusted eurodollar rate as defined under the facility plus a margin  or b the higher of i the federal funds rate plus one half of or ii the prime lending rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under the facility 
at december  and march   the date we repaid and terminated our former senior credit facility  the interest margin above the adjusted eurodollar rate was computed on the basis of our leverage ratio 
for the three months ended march  and for the year ended december   the weighted average borrowings outstanding under our former senior credit facility during such periods bore interest at and  respectively 
as of december   we were not in compliance with certain covenants under our former senior credit facility that the lenders waived through the first quarter of our senior notes  which we originally issued on october  to an insurance company in an aggregate principal amount of million  bore interest at a rate of per annum  payable semiannually in april and october of each year 
in connection with the repayment of our senior notes  we incurred a prepayment penalty of approximately million 
as of december   we were not in compliance with certain covenants under our senior notes that the lenders waived through the first quarter of we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements which details these future obligations and commitments 
interest rate swaps 
during the second and third quarters of  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements in notional amounts totaling million 
the agreements  which have payment and expiration dates that correspond to the terms of the note obligations they cover  effectively converted million of our fixed rate senior subordinated notes and million of our fixed rate senior notes into variable rate obligations 
the variable rates are based on the three month libor plus a fixed margin 
these swap agreements decreased interest expense by million in we expect our swap agreements to continue to lower our interest expense  however  if the three month libor increases significantly  our interest expense could be adversely affected 
based on the three month libor at december   our swaps would reduce our interest expense by approximately million in compared with million in  as mentioned above 
if the three month libor increased basis points  our savings on interest expense would be reduced by approximately million

simultaneously  we executed a new swap agreement with a fixed margin that was basis points higher than the original swap agreement 
the new swap agreement is the same notional amount  has the same terms and covers the same notes as the original agreement 
the million gain will be accreted to interest expense over the life of the notes and will partially offset the increase in interest expense 
we executed these transactions in order to take advantage of current market conditions 
joint venture financings 
as noted above  we own a interest in two joint ventures with temple inland  inc standard gypsum  lp and premier boxboard limited llc 
because we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting  the indebtedness of these joint ventures is not reflected in the liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheets 
as described below  we have guaranteed certain obligations of these joint ventures 
a default under these guarantees also constitutes a default under the credit facilities of these joint ventures and our senior credit facility 
the guarantees also contain independent financial maintenance covenants that are identical to the covenants under our senior credit facility 
accordingly  our default under one or more of these covenants would technically permit the lenders under the joint venture credit facilities and our joint venture partner s respective guarantees of those facilities  as well as the lenders under our senior credit facility  if they so elected  to prohibit any future borrowings under these facilities and to accelerate all such outstanding obligations under these facilities 
the resulting acceleration of our obligations could also cause further defaults and accelerations under our senior subordinated notes  our senior notes and our senior notes 
at december  and december   we were not in compliance with the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio  respectively  under these guarantees  but in each case were able to obtain appropriate amendments and waivers with respect to this non compliance and with respect to any technical cross defaults 
standard gypsum is the obligor under reimbursement agreements pursuant to which direct pay letters of credit in the aggregate original amount of approximately million have been issued for its account in support of industrial development bond obligations 
we have severally and unconditionally guaranteed of standard gypsum s obligations for reimbursement of letter of credit drawings  interest  fees and other amounts 
the other standard gypsum partner  temple inland  has similarly guaranteed of standard gypsum s obligations 
as of december   the outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately million  of which one half approximately million is guaranteed by us 
premier boxboard is the borrower under a credit facility providing for up to million in revolving loans with a subfacility for up to million in letters of credit 
the credit facility was originally entered into in july and matures in june we have severally and unconditionally guaranteed of premier boxboard s obligations under the credit facility for principal including reimbursement of letter of credit drawings  interest  fees and other amounts 
temple inland has similarly guaranteed of premier boxboard s obligations 
as of december   the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the facility including outstanding letters of credit was approximately million  of which one half approximately million is guaranteed by us 
in addition to the general default risks discussed above with respect to the joint ventures  a substantial portion of the assets of premier boxboard are pledged as security for million in outstanding principal amount of senior notes under which premier boxboard is the obligor 
these notes are guaranteed by temple inland  but are not guaranteed by us 
additionally  a default under the premier boxboard credit facility would also constitute an event of default under these notes 
in the event of default under these notes  the holders would also have recourse to the assets of premier boxboard that are pledged to secure these notes 
thus  any resulting default under these notes could result in the assets of premier boxboard being utilized to satisfy creditor claims  which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operations of premier boxboard and  accordingly  our interest in premier boxboard 
further  in such an event of default  these assets would not be available to satisfy obligations owing to unsecured creditors of premier boxboard  including the lender under the credit facility  which might make it more likely that our guarantee of the premier boxboard credit facility would be the primary source of repayment under the facility in the event premier boxboard cannot pay 
additional contingencies relating to our joint ventures that could affect our liquidity include possible additional capital contributions and buy sell triggers which  under certain circumstances  give us and our joint venture partner either the right  or the obligation  to purchase the other s interest or to sell an interest to the other 
in the case of both standard gypsum and premier boxboard  neither joint venture partner is obligated or required to make additional capital contributions without the consent of the other 
with regard to buy sell rights  under the standard gypsum joint venture  in general  either party may purchase the other s interest upon the occurrence of certain purported unauthorized transfers or involuntary transfer events such as bankruptcy 
in addition  under the standard gypsum joint venture  either i in the event of an unresolved deadlock over a material matter or ii at any time after april   either party may initiate a russian roulette buyout procedure by which it names a price at which the other party must agree either to sell its interest to the initiating party or to purchase the initiating party s interest 
under the premier boxboard joint venture  in general  mutual buy sell rights are triggered upon the occurrence of certain purported unauthorized or involuntary transfers  but in the event of certain change of control or deadlock events  the buy sell rights are structured such that we are always the party entitled  or obligated  as the case may be  to purchase 
we generally consider our relationship with temple inland to be good with respect to both of our joint ventures and do not anticipate experiencing material liquidity events resulting from either additional capital contributions or buy sell contingencies with respect to our joint ventures during we cannot assure you  however  that these assumptions will prove accurate or that such liquidity events will not arise 
cash from operations 
cash generated from operations was million for the year ended december   compared with million in the decrease in compared to the same period in was due primarily to lower net income and a decrease in distributions from our joint ventures  partially offset by the receipt of a million federal tax refund in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million in versus million in aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million are anticipated for to conserve cash  we intend to limit capital expenditures for to cost reduction  productivity improvement and replacement projects 
acquisitions 
in february  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of milpak  inc in exchange for  shares of our common stock valued at million and million in cash 
milpak operates a facility located in pine brook  new jersey that provides blister packaging  cartoning and labeling  and other contract packaging services 
in september  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of arrow paper products company in exchange for  shares of our common stock valued at million 
arrow is located in saginaw  michigan and operates two tube and core converting facilities that serve customers in the automotive  film  housewares and other specialty tube and core markets

we issued  of the shares in and the balance in crane operates a single folding carton manufacturing facility located in suburban chicago  illinois 
during the second quarter of  we formed a joint venture with temple inland  inc to own and operate temple inland s newport  indiana containerboard mill 
the joint venture  premier boxboard limited llc  undertook a month  million project to modify the mill to enable it to produce a new  lightweight gypsum facing paper along with other containerboard grades 
the mill began operations as modified at the beginning of the third quarter of under the joint venture agreement  we contributed million to the joint venture during the second quarter of  and temple inland contributed the net assets of the mill and received million in notes issued by premier boxboard 
each partner has a interest in the joint venture  and we account for our interest in this joint venture under the equity method 
our subsidiary  pbl inc  manages the day to day operations of premier boxboard  pursuant to a management agreement with temple inland 
in april  we purchased international paper company s sprague boxboard mill located in versailles  connecticut 
this acquisition has had a significant impact on our earnings in and sprague incurred operating losses of million and million in and  respectively  including the reversal of reserves related to unfavorable supply contracts 
excluding the sprague reserve reductions in and  operating losses were million and million  respectively  an improvement of million 
the losses were attributable to a combination of unfavorable fixed price contracts  low capacity utilization  high energy costs and higher fiber costs that we were unable to pass through to our customers 
our primary objectives at sprague have been to improve quality  reduce costs and increase sales volume 
we have made significant progress in quality and cost and are beginning to realize the benefits 
based on improvements we have made since the acquisition  we now believe sprague is competitive in terms of cost and quality  and we expect sprague s financial performance to improve with increases in sales volume 
although we expect losses at sprague to continue to decline  in light of current difficult industry conditions  we do not expect sprague to be profitable until the second half of dividends 
we paid cash dividends of million in versus million in in february  we reduced our first quarter dividend from to per issued and outstanding common share 
in june  we reduced our second  third and fourth quarter dividend from to per issued and outstanding common share 
as described below under subsequent events  we have temporarily suspended future payments of quarterly dividends  beginning in the first quarter of we made these decisions to reduce the quarterly dividends to preserve our financial flexibility in light of difficult industry conditions and due to the limitations on dividend payments in our financial covenants 
although our former debt agreements contained no specific limitations on the payment of dividends  our current debt agreements contain certain limitations on the payment of future dividends 
we will need to earn at least million in net income before our debt covenants would permit us to resume payment of quarterly dividends 
we intend to continue assessing our ability to pay quarterly dividends in light of difficult industry conditions  our need to preserve financial flexibility and the limitations on dividends included in our financial covenants 
share repurchases 
we did not purchase any shares of our common stock during  or under our common stock purchase plan 
we have cumulatively purchased  shares since january our board of directors has authorized purchases of up to  additional shares 
however  our senior subordinated notes and our senior credit facility limit our ability to purchase our common stock 
inflation raw material price changes have had  and continue to have  a material effect on our operations 
energy prices had a material effect on our operations in and we do not believe that general economic inflation is a significant determinant of our raw material price increases or that  except as it relates to energy prices  it has a material effect on our operations 
subsequent events in january  we completed a third amendment to our senior credit facility that modified the definitions of interest expense  premier boxboard interest expense and standard gypsum interest expense to include interest income and the benefit or expense derived from interest rate swap agreements or other interest hedge agreements 
additionally  the amendment lowered the minimum allowable interest coverage ratio for the fourth quarter of from to  the first quarter of from to  and the second quarter of from to also in january  we entered into agreements with the pbl and standard gypsum lenders that correspond to the amendments made in the third amendment to the senior credit facility  as described above  in order to avoid events of default under those guarantees resulting from a violation of the interest ratio coverage covenants 
in february  we announced that we would suspend future dividend payments on our common stock until our earnings performance exceeds the dividend limitation provision of our senior subordinated notes 
georgia pacific litigation on may   we and georgia pacific corporation jointly announced a tentative settlement regarding the litigation over the terms of the long term supply contract the parties entered in april the pending litigation relating to that contract has been previously reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and in our previous quarterly reports on form q 
under the terms of the tentative settlement  we and g p gypsum corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of georgia pacific  entered into a new ten year agreement under which we would supply a minimum of  tons of gypsum facing paper per year to g p gypsum 
implementation of the new agreement  and settlement of the pending litigation over the agreement  is subject to satisfactory completion of a transition period 
the transition period initially was to expire no later than august  as described below  however  the parties have twice agreed to extend the outside termination date of the transition period  most recently to april  during the transition period  we are supplying g p gypsum with such facing paper as it requests to enable it to evaluate the paper s compliance with its specifications for quality and end use suitability 
once g p gypsum is satisfied with the paper  it is to notify us that the transition period has ended  and at that time the term of the new agreement  including the annual minimum quantity requirement described above  is to commence 
if and when the new agreement commences  the parties will dismiss all pending litigation relating to the agreement 
under the terms of the tentative settlement  either party may terminate its obligations under the new agreement during the transition period without cause and without liability to the other party 
during the second quarter of  ongoing discussions with g p gypsum led to a mutual agreement to extend the outside expiration date of the transition period initially to december  the extension was the result of georgia pacific s recent curtailment of a significant portion of its gypsum wallboard manufacturing capacity because of adverse market conditions 
this curtailment  along with georgia pacific s stated reservations about committing to the minimum tonnage requirement under the new agreement in light of current market conditions  led the parties to agree to the extension of the transition period 
continued recent discussions  however  have led the parties to agree to further extend the outside expiration date of the transition period to april  although we believe that we are able to satisfy g p gypsum s product requirements  we can give no assurance that the new agreement will be implemented in accordance with its terms or that the pending litigation will be dismissed 
specifically  we cannot predict whether georgia pacific s recent curtailment of gypsum wallboard manufacturing capacity will further affect whether  when or how a new agreement is implemented  including whether such curtailment will result in modifications to the ultimate volume requirements under any new contract that may be implemented 
accordingly  we believe that our operating results and financial condition will continue to be materially and adversely affected by the loss of contract volume from georgia pacific unless and until a new supply agreement is implemented with significant volume requirements  and until a new supply agreement has been effective long enough to generate a substantial volume of required purchases from georgia pacific
