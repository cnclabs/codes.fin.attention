our global web network includes world properties 
headquartered in sunnyvale  california  we have offices in the united states  europe  asia  latin america  australia and canada 
we conduct our business globally and manage it geographically 
we rely on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and certain operating cost information for making financial decisions and allocating resources 
our principal areas of measurement and decision making are the united states and international 
revenues 
our revenues are derived principally from services  which include marketing services  fees and listings  and transactions 
no one customer accounted for or more of net revenues during these periods 
marketing services revenues are primarily generated from the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements 
banner advertising agreements typically range from one week to three years 
sponsorship advertising agreements have longer terms  ranging from three months to five years  and often involve multiple element arrangements 
banner and sponsorship advertisement revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered or ratably over the contract period  where applicable  and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
impressions are defined as the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of the yahoo network 
we recognize revenue on these arrangements in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
periodically  we engage in barter transactions for marketing services 
barter revenue is recognized over the periods in which we complete our obligations under the arrangement 
prior to january  barter transactions were recorded at the fair value of the goods or services provided or received  whichever was more readily determinable in the circumstances 
in january  we adopted emerging issues task force no 
eitf  accounting for advertising barter transactions  which requires advertising barter transactions to be valued based on similar cash transactions that have occurred within six months prior to the barter transaction 
barter revenues represented   and of total revenues for  and during  we delivered approximately billion impressions  as compared to billion in  under barter arrangements where fair value was not determinable under eitf  and accordingly revenue was not recognized 
fees and listings revenues consist of revenues generated from a variety of consumer and business fee and listings based services  including small business services  yahoo portal solutions formerly known as corporate yahoo  broadcasting live and on demand events  yahoo personals and certain search and directory services 
with the exception of yahoo portal solutions  revenues are recognized in the month in which the services are performed  provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenues from yahoo portal solutions consist of software license arrangements and are recognized upon delivery of the software in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition and statement of position  modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
platform and maintenance revenues for yahoo portal solutions are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
software license revenues have represented less than of total net revenues for  and transactions revenues include service fees for facilitating transactions through the yahoo network  principally from our commerce properties 
transactions revenues are recognized upon notification from the customer that qualifying transactions have occurred and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
results of operations net revenues net revenues by groups of similar service were as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  marketing services    fees and listings    transactions    percent of net revenues marketing services revenues 
marketing services revenues are primarily generated from the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements 
marketing services in decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease is due primarily to the softening of the global economy which significantly impacted many of our customers marketing budgets 
further impacting marketing services revenues was the decrease in commitment levels and related pricing from companies who advertise on the internet 
in addition  internet companies spent significantly less money in due to diminished access to capital markets as compared to and during  our customer base has shifted toward more traditional marketers 
the increase in absolute dollars from to was due primarily to the increasing number of advertisers purchasing space on the yahoo network as well as an increase in the size of advertising purchased 
approximately  customers advertised on the yahoo network during as compared to approximately  and  in and  respectively 
no one customer accounted for or more of net revenues during  and there can be no assurance that the purchasing pattern of customers advertising on the yahoo network will not continue to fluctuate  that advertisers will not continue to make smaller and shorter term purchases  or that market prices for online advertising will not decrease due to competitive or other factors 
due to our ongoing transition in customer base from internet companies to companies in more traditional lines of business  as well as seasonality and the continuing weakness in world wide economic conditions  we currently believe that marketing services revenues will remain comparable in absolute dollars with our marketing services revenues 
fees and listings revenues 
fees and listings revenues consist of revenues generated from a variety of fee and listings based services we provide 
these services primarily include small business services  yahoo portal solutions  broadcasting live and on demand events  yahoo personals and certain search and directory services 
fees and listings revenues in increased million  or  as compared to the increase is primarily attributable to the expanding deployment of yahoo portal solutions and monetization of certain search and directory services  as well as the increase in number of users for our other fee and listings based services 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from broadcasted events  caused mainly by a decrease in the number of events to approximately  during  as compared to  events during fees and listings revenues in increased million  or  as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the increasing number of events and average revenue per event broadcasted as well as the increasing number of users of the various fee and listings based services 
we broadcasted approximately  events during  as compared to  during for  we currently expect fees and listings revenues to increase in absolute dollars 
transactions revenues 
transaction revenues in increased by million  or  as compared to and increased by million from to the year over year increases are primarily a result of the increasing number of electronic commerce transactions enabled on the yahoo network  principally from our commerce properties 
in  the increase in transactions is primarily driven by a shift from some of our marketing service agreements as well as a change in our yahoo store platform  which have historically been fixed pricing arrangements  towards performance based agreements 
transactions revenues are also currently expected to increase in absolute dollars 
overall  we currently expect total combined revenues for marketing services  fees and listings and transactions to increase in as compared to costs and expenses primary operating costs and expenses were as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  cost of revenues    sales and marketing    product development    general and administrative    percent of net revenues cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of the expenses associated with the production and usage of the yahoo network 
these costs primarily consist of fees paid to third parties for content included on our online media properties  internet connection charges  equipment depreciation  live event production costs  license fees and compensation related expenses 
cost of revenues in increased by million  or  as compared to cost of revenues in increased million  or  as compared to the year over year increases in absolute dollars are primarily a result of an increase in costs associated with growing network usage and additional content for new and enhanced services on the yahoo network 
as measured in page views defined as electronic page displays per day  we delivered an average of approximately billion page views per day in december compared to million page views per day in december and an average of approximately million page views per day in december yahoo japan  an unconsolidated joint venture with softbank  is included in these page view figures and accounted for an average of approximately million page views per day in december  million page views per day in december and million page views per day in december we currently anticipate that cost of revenues will continue to increase modestly in absolute dollars in  as network usage increases and additional content is introduced for new and enhanced services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and other marketing related expenses  compensation related expenses  sales commissions and travel costs 
sales and marketing expenses in decreased million  or  as compared to this was primarily the result of our overall effort to manage discretionary costs and the restructuring programs described below 
the cost efficiencies gained in were partially offset by costs related to the continued investment in our consolidated international subsidiaries 
the year over year increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues is primarily due to lower marketing services revenues 
sales and marketing expenses in increased million  or  as compared to  primarily as a result of the increase in advertising and distribution costs associated with our aggressive brand building strategy  increases in compensation expense associated with growth in the direct sales force and marketing personnel  expansion in the international subsidiaries and an increase in sales commissions associated with the increase in revenues 
we currently anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars will be relatively consistent in as compared to product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses incurred for enhancements to and maintenance of the yahoo network  classification and organization of listings within yahoo properties  research and development expenses  and other operating costs 
product development expenses in increased million  or  as compared to and increased million  or  from to the year over year increases in absolute dollars are primarily attributable to increases in the total compensation for engineers that develop and enhance media properties on the yahoo network and their related compensation during the respective years  offset by savings obtained through our restructuring programs described below 
we believe that continued investments in product development are required to remain competitive 
consequently  we currently anticipate that product development costs in absolute dollars will increase modestly in compared to general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses and fees for professional services 
general and administrative expenses in increased million  or  as compared to and increased million  or  from to the year over year increases in absolute dollars were primarily attributable to increases in the above areas  partially offset by decreases from cost efficiencies obtained through our restructuring programs  described below 
we currently believe that general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars will increase modestly in compared to amortization of intangibles 
from time to time we have purchased  and expect to continue purchasing  assets or businesses which may result in the creation of intangible assets 
amortization of intangibles expenses was million for  or  of net revenues 
for and  amortization of intangibles expenses were million and million  or and of net revenues  respectively 
the year over year absolute dollar increases in amortization of intangibles are primarily the result of acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting during those years 
effective january   we have adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill will no longer be amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually 
see recent accounting pronouncements for further information related to the adoption of sfas restructuring costs 
in april and december  we announced restructuring programs to balance our investment in growth areas with the desire to modify our near term business plan to reflect the current economic and capital market slowdown 
these restructuring programs included worldwide workforce reductions  consolidation of excess facilities and other charges 
as a result of these restructuring programs  we recorded restructuring costs of million classified as operating expenses in worldwide workforce reduction 
the restructuring programs resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately employees across certain business functions  operating units  and geographic regions 
the worldwide workforce reductions in april and december were substantially completed within we recorded a workforce reduction charge of million in relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits 
consolidation of excess facilities and other charges 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in relating to the consolidation of excess facilities and other charges 
of this charge  approximately million was primarily for excess facilities relating to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs 
this estimate is based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
if facilities rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate 
property and equipment that was disposed of or removed from operations resulted in a net charge of million and consisted primarily of furniture and fixtures  servers  leasehold improvements  and computer equipment 
we also recorded other restructuring costs of million relating primarily to payments for professional fees incurred with the restructuring program 
a summary of the restructuring costs is as follows in thousands total charge noncash charges cash payments restructuring accrual at december  workforce reduction     consolidation of excess facilities and other charges   total     the restructuring accrual is included on the balance sheet in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
the accrual related to the workforce reduction was substantially paid subsequent to december  amounts related to the net lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through december we have substantially completed the implementation of the restructuring programs during the fourth quarter of we expect the restructuring programs to result in annual savings of approximately million in operating expenses effective january acquisition related costs 
acquisition related costs consist primarily of contract and facility termination expenses  write offs of certain related fixed assets and leasehold improvements  professional services  severance costs associated with the termination of certain employees and various registration and filing fees incurred in connection with business combinations recorded under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
we also expensed certain in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use in connection with business combinations recorded under the purchase method of accounting 
acquisition related costs were million  million and million for  and acquisition related costs in were for incremental costs associated with the final settlement of a facilities lease termination in connection with the egroups acquisition 
during  these costs related primarily to the acquisition of egroups 
during  these costs related to the acquisitions of encompass  geocities  online anywhere  broadcast 
com  onelist  inc  log me on and issg 
due to the elimination of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations as a result of the issuance of statement of accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  future acquisition related costs are expected to be limited to in process research and development for technologies acquired in business combinations that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use 
such amounts could have a significant impact on future financial results 
other income loss  net 
other income loss  net was as follows in thousands years ended december  interest income    investment gains losses   contract termination fee  earnings in equity interests    other  other income loss  net was million  million and million for  and the increase from to was primarily the result of the smaller net investment loss of million which includes a gain of million related to the sale of certain equity instruments in compared to million which includes a gain of million related to the exchange of certain equity investments in  million of income related to a contract termination fee in and interest income on our larger average investment balance in the amounts were partially offset by declining interest rates and foreign exchange losses 
the decrease from to was primarily the result of net investment losses of million  partially offset by interest income from a higher average investment balance 
other income loss  net in future periods may fluctuate as a result of changes in our average investment balances held  changes in market rates or the sale of investments  and investment impairments 
minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries represents the minority partners percentage share of income or losses from such subsidiaries 
minority interests in income from operations of consolidated subsidiaries was million  million and million for  and the change from to was due to lower profits within the consolidated affiliates which was attributable to weaker economic climates in europe and korea 
the change from to was attributable to the increased profits in the joint ventures 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for  and differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal rate principally due to a change in valuation allowance related to nondeductible impairment write downs of certain of our equity investments  foreign losses not benefited  nondeductible costs related to acquisitions  nondeductible amortization charges related to acquisitions  nondeductible stock based compensation charges  nontaxable re organizational gains resulting from exchanges of certain equity investments  and a change in income tax regulations resulting in the recognition of certain acquired loss carryforward benefits 
business segment results we conduct business globally and manage it geographically 
our segments for financial reporting purposes are the united states and international 
management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides segment ebitda information for making financial decisions and allocating resources 
segment ebitda information includes income from operations before certain unallocated operating costs and expenses  including stock compensation expense  amortization of intangibles  depreciation  restructuring costs and acquisition related costs 
we believe that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure of evaluating the operating performance of our segments 
however  segment ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  operating income  cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue is attributed to individual countries according to the international online property that generated the revenue 
no single foreign country accounted for more than of net revenues in   and summarized information by segment for   and  as excerpted from the internal management reports  is as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  net revenues united states    international    total net revenues    segment ebitda united states    international    total segment ebitda    segment ebitda includes income from operations before certain unallocated operating costs and expenses  including stock compensation expense  amortization of intangibles  depreciation  restructuring costs and acquisition related costs 
percent of total net revenues 
segment ebitda margin 
united states 
united states revenues in decreased million  or  in absolute dollars as well as decreased as a percentage of net revenues primarily due to the overall softening of the global economy  which significantly impacted many of our customers  marketing budgets 
united states revenues in increased in absolute dollars by million  or  yet decreased as a percentage of revenues 
the absolute dollar growth was attributable to the increased number of advertisers and size of advertising contracts purchased on our site during  while the decrease as a percentage of revenue was attributable to the expansion of our international markets 
united states segment ebitda decreased million  or  in absolute dollars from to  primarily as a result of decreased net revenues due to the softening of the online advertising market 
the united states segment ebitda decreased in absolute dollars less than revenues in due to cost savings obtained through a reduction in discretionary spending and the restructuring programs 
united states segment ebitda increased million  or  in absolute dollars from to  due to the increase in revenues as a result of stronger economic conditions and capital markets during that period  partially offset by investment in our employees  brand building and infrastructure costs 
international 
international revenues in decreased million  or  in absolute dollars primarily due to the decline in international advertising which occurred across all international markets during international revenues in increased in absolute dollars by million  or  due to extending our reach and product offerings in international markets and expanding into additional countries during and  to cover most major advertising regions 
international segment ebitda decreased million  or  in absolute dollars from to  primarily as a result of the decline in advertising revenues  offset partially by reduced discretionary spending 
international segment ebitda increased million  or  in absolute dollars from to which was considerably less than our growth in revenues as we invested in our international operations 
acquisitions in january  we completed the acquisition of kimo 
com  a taiwanese internet communications and media company  for a total purchase price of million 
during  we also acquired other companies  for an aggregate purchase price of million  that were not significant to our financial position or results of operations 
see note acquisitions in the financial statements for further discussion of acquisitions that we have made in  and in february  we completed the acquisition of hotjobs 
com  ltd  hotjobs  a leading provider of comprehensive online recruiting solutions for employers  staffing firms and job seekers for a total estimated purchase price of million offset by cash acquired of million 
hotjobs will become a part of our listings properties and is expected to generate revenue principally through listings and subscription fees for access to hotjobs database 
for  hotjobs had reported net revenues of million and a net loss of million 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of commitments related to the hotjobs acquisition 
related party transactions softbank  including its consolidated affiliates softbank  was approximately a stockholder at december  we have joint ventures with softbank in france  germany  japan  korea and the united kingdom 
a managing partner of a softbank affiliate is also a member of our board of directors 
as a result  softbank is able to significantly influence all matters requiring yahoo stockholder approval 
revenues from softbank accounted for approximately of net revenues during each of the years  and we believe contracted prices are comparable to those given to our other similarly situated customers 
see item of this form k certain relationships and related transactions  note related party transactions and note joint ventures in the financial statements for further information related to transactions with related parties 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible receivables  investment values  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets valuation allowance  accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities  and goodwill impairment 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are primarily generated from the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements  and revenues generated from a variety of fee and listings based services 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  the recognition of these revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
valuation allowances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would likely increase stockholders equity as substantially all of our net operating losses result from employee stock option deductions 
accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we recorded approximately million of impairments on the carrying value of equity securities during goodwill impairment 
our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets of million and million  respectively  as of december  during  we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which generally required us to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use of these assets 
no impairment losses were recorded related to goodwill and other intangible assets during we are adopting sfas effective january  we expect that approximately million to million of goodwill will be impaired upon the adoption of sfas in connection with the transition impairment tests  which are required to be completed no later than december  the impairment resulting from these transition tests will be recorded as of january  and will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we have not yet determined the amount of the impairment loss but expect to complete that measurement by march  any further impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  which supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
in addition  sfas establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill and requires unamortized negative goodwill to be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain  instead of being deferred and amortized 
the provisions of sfas have been adopted as of july  the adoption of sfas has not changed the method of accounting used in previous business combinations initiated prior to july   including those we accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
in july  the fasb also issued sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  certain provisions also apply to acquisitions initiated subsequent to june  sfas supercedes apb opinion no 
intangible assets and requires  among other things  the discontinuance of amortization related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
these assets will then be subject to an impairment test at least annually 
in addition  the statement includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  the identification of reporting units for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  the reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  and reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill 
we will adopt sfas effective january   which will result  among other items  in no longer amortizing existing goodwill 
at december  and  goodwill approximated million and million  respectively  and goodwill amortization approximated million  million and million for  and we expect that approximately million to million of goodwill will be impaired upon the adoption of sfas in connection with the transition impairment tests which are required to be completed no later than december  the impairment resulting from these transition tests will be recorded as of january  and will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we expect to complete the impairment loss measurement by march  in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas and certain provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations  be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas also broadens the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity that have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the effect of this statement on our results of operations and financial position 
liquidity and capital resources in summary our cash flows were in thousands cash provided by operating activities    cash used in investing activities    cash provided by financing activities    we invest excess cash predominantly in debt instruments that are highly liquid  of high quality investment grade  and predominantly have maturities of less than two years with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating purposes 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable debt securities totaling approximately billion compared to approximately billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
restricted cash and restricted long term investments amounted to million and million as of december  and cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation  amortization  tax benefits from stock options  net investment losses  restructuring costs and other non cash items  and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities

operating leases during  we entered into agreements for the development of an office complex in sunnyvale  california to serve as our headquarters 
construction was completed in the third quarter of upon substantial completion of the construction  we funded the lease facility with deposited funds drawn on the facility by the lessors 
the total amount funded was approximately million 
approximately million of this amount represents an investment in the lease facility resulting from our role as a participant in the master lease facility 
the remaining million represents collateral for funds provided by the facility s other participants 
these amounts have been classified as restricted long term investments at december  rent obligations for the complex bear a direct relationship to the lessor s carrying costs of million 
the lease provides us with the option at the end of the lease term in to i acquire the buildings for an amount equal to the lessor s carrying costs  ii re market the buildings  or iii renew the lease for a second  five year term  upon written consent of the participating parties 
we have guaranteed the residual value associated with the buildings under the lease to the lessor of approximately of the lessor s carrying costs 
we have entered into various non cancelable operating lease agreements for our sunnyvale headquarters  sales offices throughout the us  and our international subsidiaries for original lease periods ranging from months to years and expiring between and in addition  we have entered into various sublease arrangements associated with our excess facilities under the restructuring programs 
such subleases have terms extending through and amounts estimated to be received have been included in determining the restructuring accrual 
net lease commitments as of december  can be summarized as follows in millions year ended december  gross lease commitments sublease income net lease commitments due after years we also have an agreement committing to lease two additional buildings adjacent to our headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
construction began in the fourth quarter of and the buildings are expected to be ready for occupancy in the third quarter of upon completion of the building construction  we have committed to a year lease obligation  with annual lease payments under the lease of approximately million in year one  approximately million in year two  and with increases of in each of the following years 
after year one of the lease  we have the right to i purchase the buildings for approximately million  plus fees  ii restructure the lease arrangement  or iii continue leasing the buildings under the original agreement for the remaining fourteen years 
these amounts are not included in the table above 
other commitments in the ordinary course of business we enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners principally for marketing  bandwidth and content arrangements 
there are no material commitments for these arrangements extending beyond in march  we announced that the board of directors had authorized a repurchase of up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time over the next two years  depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
we may utilize equity instrument contracts to facilitate the repurchase of common stock 
pursuant to this repurchase program  we have repurchased a total of million shares for approximately million through december  and may continue to repurchase shares in future periods 
as discussed in acquisitions above  we acquired hotjobs in february under the terms of the acquisition  we committed to pay approximately million in cash offset by cash to be acquired of million and issue approximately million shares of common stock 
these amounts were substantially paid and issued  respectively  in february refer to note subsequent event for further discussion of the hotjobs acquisition 
we have experienced a substantial increase in capital expenditures and operating lease arrangements since our inception  which is consistent with our increased staffing and operational expansion  and we anticipate that this will continue in the future as business conditions merit 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  products  and technologies that are complementary to our business  which may require the use of cash 
management believes existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet operating requirements for at least the next twelve months  however  we may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position 
the sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the our investment portfolio and our lease obligation pertaining to our headquarter facility in sunnyvale  ca 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our investment portfolio 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates

foreign currency risk 
international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries accounted for approximately of total revenues during international sales are made mostly from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility when compared to the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability

investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
since our initial investment  certain of these investments in privately held companies have become marketable equity securities upon the investees completing initial public offerings 
such investments  most of which are in the internet industry  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market  and are recorded as long term investments 
for these investments in public and privately held companies  our policy is to monitor these investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment  and reductions in carrying value when necessary 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december   the net unrealized gains of million on these investments have been recorded net of deferred taxes of million as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies  certain of which may be classified as derivatives  for business and strategic purposes and have classified these securities as available for sale 
these available for sale equity investments  primarily in internet and technology companies  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
we have realized gains and losses from both the sale of investments  as well as mergers and acquisitions of companies in which we have invested 
as of december   we had available for sale equity investments with a fair value of million and a cost basis of million 
the net unrealized gains of million have been recorded net of deferred taxes of million as a separate component of stockholders equity and gains on derivatives of million have been recorded in other income on the statement of operations 
our objective in managing exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to earnings and cash flows 
however  continued market volatility  as well as mergers and acquisitions  have the potential to have a material non cash impact on our operating results in future periods
