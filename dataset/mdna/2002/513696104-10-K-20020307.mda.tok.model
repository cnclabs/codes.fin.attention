item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion of the consolidated statements of operations the consolidated statements of operations present lamson sessions operating performance over the last three years 
results of operations net sales increased by or million in compared with overall  carlon experienced a growth rate of or million for the year over incremental hdpe conduit sales totaled approximately million primarily from the pyramid and ameriduct acquisitions  which were completed in the latter part of the remainder of carlon s product sales declined from levels by approximately 
this decrease was caused by a general economic slowdown  which persisted throughout the year  and continued contraction in telecommunications infrastructure capital spending 
lamson home products had a net sales decline of million or in compared with  as home improvement retailers reduced their inventories during the year in response to softness in sales and inconsistent consumer confidence levels 
lastly  the pvc pipe business segment net sales dropped or million in compared with pipe volume shipped was up while average pricing declined by approximately from mix has also shifted this year in the pvc pipe business as telecommunications related conduit is down in units shipped  which has been offset by increased electrical conduit shipments  primarily in the first three quarters of the year 
net sales increased in to million from million in  representing a growth rate 
excluding the two acquisitions made by the company during the year  net sales would have increased by  or million 
all three business segments experienced healthy growth during this year 
carlon grew by million  or  primarily from the pyramid and ameriduct acquisitions  which added million in combined net sales 
this business unit generated a growth from its core electrical and telecommunications products  reflecting price increases early in the year and modest market growth 
lamson home products increased its net sales level by million  or  over to million 
this improvement in the top line is almost entirely from additional business at this business segment s second largest customer  as price increases were negligible 
the pvc pipe business had an outstanding year as sales increased by  or million  to million 
these results reflect a increase in selling price per unit as resin costs were up by an average of during versus the company gave up market share to maintain material spreads as the construction market was very strong throughout the first half of this year 
telecommunications duct volume was up by this year  the mix improving from predominantly electrical conduit to a more balanced product distribution 
gross margin in was  down from the margin realized in this drop was primarily caused by the margin squeeze experienced in the pvc pipe business  as a continued oversupply of pvc resin in the domestic market has caused pvc pipe selling prices to be down over from a year ago  while pvc resin costs have declined on average for the year 
in addition  the significant mix shift in pvc pipe from telecommunications duct to electrical conduit has had a negative impact on its gross margin 
finally  the company utilized its manufacturing facilities at a much reduced rate  in vs 
in  generating approximately million more in unfavorable manufacturing variances during the current year 
gross margin grew by over to in  compared with in this improvement was a result of better margins in both the carlon and the pvc pipe businesses from price increases and product mix improvements 
overall distribution and freight costs were around million less on a comparable basis to  primarily due to the consolidation of distribution operations completed last year and effective management of freight surcharges incurred in operating expenses in totaled million or of net sales compared with million or of net sales in during the year the company consolidated the selling  general and administrative processes of the two acquisitions to reduce any redundant costs 
in addition  discretionary spending was reduced  as it became evident economic conditions were declining 
during  the company also recorded net gains of million relating to the resolution of the pw eagle litigation  changes in estimates for certain other litigation and environmental liabilities and a gain on the sale of a non strategic business 
the company also incurred a restructuring and impairment charge of million to reduce excess capacity  eliminate under performing product lines and reduce salaried staff of which 
million was included in cost of products sold 
in summary  the company earned million in operating income  or of net sales  in million  or  excluding the restructuring and impairment charge and net gains vs 
million  or  of net sales in operating expenses were million in million higher than  or  of net sales compared with of net sales in continued productivity improvements in general administrative activities offset increases in sales commission and legal  professional and acquisition related expenses 
the result was more than a two and a half times increase in operating income to million of net sales in versus million of net sales in interest expense increased by million in due to the acquisition debt of approximately million added late in the company had an average borrowing rate during of compared with in the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda was million for  compared with the million ebitda earned in financial condition despite the lower operating income in  the company focused on generating cash flow from working capital reductions 
working capital was million at the end of compared with million at the end of the current ratio decreased to in from in as accounts receivable and inventory declined by a combined million from lower economic activity and improved inventory control  while payables and accruals declined by million 
cash flow generated from operating activities was a strong million in versus million in accounts receivable were million at the end of  compared with million at the end of days sales outstanding in were about and approximately the same as the days for inventory levels at the end of were million compared with million at the end of as a result  annual inventory turns increased from times in to times in all inventory categories have been reduced  however  the largest reduction came in pvc resin and related products for which pounds in inventory were lower and average unit cost at year end was more than lower than the year end levels 
accounts payable decreased by million in from the prior year end  primarily from the purchasing of raw material inventory and lower unit costs for these items 
the current balance in deferred tax assets decreased due to lower than expected operating results limiting the short term utilization of net operating losses 
accrued liabilities at year end were approximately million less than the prior year  as the final purchase price adjustment for ameriduct was paid in  incentive compensation is lower in the current year  and legal and environmental liabilities have been adjusted to reflect current evaluations of these items 
the current portion of long term debt has increased to reflect the amortization schedule of term debt provided in our credit agreement 
the strong operating cash flow experienced in the fourth quarter of the year allowed the company to pay down debt by over million during  a reduction 
capital expenditures totaled approximately million in  compared with million in the current year spending was primarily for distribution center productivity  new product tooling and quality enhancements 
the company has adequate credit capacity available to support its current operational expense and capital spending needs as well as those anticipated for the remainder of however  the company has been experiencing lower earnings levels in its pvc pipe business  reflecting an oversupply of raw materials available to support existing market demand as well as extremely low demand levels in the telecommunications infrastructure market  which is expected to continue through unless the ebitda level improves sufficiently  the company will seek a further amendment to its secured credit agreement in order to prevent a covenant violation and  concurrently  evaluate changes to its capital structure in order to ensure an appropriate degree of financial flexibility 
the company has commenced negotiations of such an amendment so that it can be entered into before a covenant violation occurs 
outlook the following paragraphs contain forward looking comments 
the comments are subject to  and the actual future results may be impacted by  the cautionary limitations and factors outlined in the following narrative comments 
the company s sales have been supported by a very steady residential construction base throughout and housing starts are expected to decline modestly during the first half of from the million unit level to closer to a million unit level before trending back up in the second half of these levels are still fairly strong compared with previous economic downturns 
interest rate cuts should help maintain the level of existing home sales  which contributes to home improvement product sales of lamson home products 
construction spending in the industrial and commercial markets are expected to be weaker than the general market  which may cause a lag in the recovery of our pvc pipe business segment 
the telecommunications infrastructure market spending remains weak as telephone and cable tv companies capital spending plans continue to be reduced 
this situation is not expected to improve appreciably until no earlier than the fourth quarter of  or the first half of spending in this market is required long term  we believe  to build out the metropolitan rings  expand corporate and institutional high speed data and communications networks and to provide broadband services to the home 
as part of the restructuring charge taken in  the company has reduced the capacity of its hdpe assets servicing this market by eliminating excess equipment and consolidating operations 
the company is also exploring other market opportunities such as gas collection  water drainage and sewer markets to better utilize its manufacturing capacity while the telecommunications market remains soft 
we believe that the cost of pvc resin may be near a cyclical floor during the fourth quarter of  as pvc resin manufacturing companies are expressing that they are selling resin for almost their cash cost  and several have announced price increases in the first quarter of this  along with reduced inventories channel wide and increased feed stock costs  should cause a stabilization of pricing in the market 
additional pvc resin manufacturing capacity scheduled to be brought up the first part of along with the lower projected us construction activity the first half of next year  however  will keep the pricing environment competitive 
improvement in the pvc pipe segment will require further substantial improvement in the pvc export market  particularly in the pacific rim to absorb the current supply imbalance in the domestic market and stabilize these costs 
should the supply demand imbalance be resolved by a strengthened export market  price levels in the pvc pipe business segment could improve quickly and more than offset a modest softening of demand in the industrial commercial market in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains expectations that are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those expected as a result of a variety of factors  such as i the volatility of resin pricing  ii the ability of the company to pass through raw material cost increases to its customers  iii maintaining a stable level of housing starts  telecommunications infrastructure spending  consumer confidence and general construction trends  iv further deterioration in the country s general economic condition affecting the markets for the company s products and v the ability of the company to obtain an amendment to its secured credit agreement

actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and commodity prices for pvc and hdpe resins 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
almost all of the company s long term debt obligations bear interest at a variable rate
