item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations paul son provides gaming equipment and supplies to casinos for new openings and consumable products for existing casino operations 
the principal consumable products have limited useful lives  ranging from several hours in the case of playing cards and dice to several months in the case of table game layouts and several years in the case of casino chips and gaming furniture 
the majority of paul son s revenues are generated by sales to customers with which paul son has an established relationship 
complementing these revenues is the significant additional revenue paul son realizes when providing a full range of products to new casinos 
paul son strives to become the casino s sole supplier of table game equipment and supplies 
during the past decade  casino entities have expanded from land based resort properties to riverboats  both cruising and dockside  and to native american lands 
as a licensed supplier  paul son has vigorously pursued table gaming opportunities in emerging gaming jurisdictions 
because of paul son s production capacity and its experience in the gaming supply industry  management believes paul son is well positioned to capitalize on the combined growth of the gaming industry both domestically and internationally 
while the gaming industry has grown in recent years  the growth rate of table games has not matched that of the gaming industry as a whole 
this trend is attributed to an increasing allocation of total casino gaming space to slot machines which  in certain cases  may reduce the allocation of total casino gaming space to table games 
the number of new table games in new jurisdictions typically follows this trend after a period of operation 
paul son operates in one operating segment casino game equipment products

management believes that the combination of cash flow from operations and cash on hand should fund ordinary operational expenses of paul son on both a short and long term basis

the combination agreement restricts us from incurring other than non recourse debt up to an additional  without b g s consent 
if we are unable to sell the mexico building  other assets  or obtain other financing sources  we may need to explore other options for funding portions of the additional transactional costs 
working capital 
working capital totaled approximately million at may   compared to approximately million in working capital at may  working capital increased approximately  during the year primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately  offset  in part  by a net decrease in current assets of approximately  principally from decreases in accounts receivable and inventory balances

capital expenditures 
we do not presently have plans to purchase any significant capital equipment for the fiscal year ended may  inventory 
during the last several years  we have experienced increased inventory obsolescence provisions which contributed to the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues 
several factors contributed to these increases  including i changes in materials used to make casino table layouts  from a more traditional woolen cloth to a longer lasting synthetic cloth  thereby causing certain obsolescence and slow movement of certain colors and quantities of woolen cloth held by us  ii a general decline in sales brought on by a trend in the casino industry to decrease the number of table games on a casino floor in favor of slot machines  and iii increased security features added to casino playing cards and casino chips which obsoleted certain materials or finished goods on hand at the time

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk paul son believes it does not have significant foreign currency risk for financial reporting purposes 
although paul son s manufacturing is principally performed in mexico  the functional currency of its mexican subsidiary is considered to be the us dollar 
the mexican operation is funded by paul son s us subsidiary in us dollars and the mexican subsidiary does not have significant financial transactions other than the receipt of us dollar funds to pay employees and the payment of certain costs to operate the manufacturing plants 
balance sheet accounts of the mexican subsidiary are maintained and reported principally in us dollar historical amounts 
therefore  the balance sheet of the mexican subsidiary is not subject to translation adjustment risk 
paul son does not enter into significant contracts to receive obligations of customers or to pay obligations to vendors in currencies other than us dollars 
therefore  paul son is not subject to significant foreign currency gains and losses 
interest rate risk as of may   paul son had total interest bearing debt and capital lease obligations of approximately million 
of this amount  approximately  has a fixed rate of interest and paul son believes this lease agreement has a fair value which approximates reported amounts 
the remaining million of interest bearing obligations have variable interest rates which are tied to a i us based prime borrowing rate of interest  and ii libor  or a london interbank offered rate  for six month dollar deposits  plus basis points 
to the extent there are significant changes to the us based prime lending rate presently approximately  paul son will have interest risk on approximately  over the next twelve months 
to the extent there are significant increases to libor  or the london interbank offered rates  and the libor rate plus basis points would exceed a floor of  paul son would have increased interest expense on approximately million of debt over the succeeding ten years
