item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations milacron operates in two business segments plastics technologies and metalworking technologies 
acquisitions in july   we acquired nickerson machinery inc  pliers international inc  and plastic moulding supply ltd 
collectively  nickerson 
with annual sales of million as of the acquisition date  nickerson sells supplies and equipment for plastics processing through two catalog distribution centers in the us and one in the us the operation in the uk also manufactures and refurbishes screws and barrels for small injection molding machines 
in august   we acquired producto chemical  inc producto  which manufactures process cleaners  washers  corrosion inhibitors and specialty products for metalworking 
producto had annual sales approaching million as of the acquisition date 
in september   we acquired oak international  inc oak  a supplier of lubricants and process cleaners used in metalforming and metalworking 
oak has three manufacturing plants  including two in the us and one in the uk  and had annual sales approaching million as of the acquisition date 
in september   we acquired the micro carbide product line  which includes solid carbide reamers  step drills and miniature tools 
these products are now being manufactured by our data flute facility 
in may   we acquired akron extruders  inc  a single screw plastics extrusion manufacturer which had annual sales of approximately million as of the acquisition date 
the manufacture of akron extruders lines of single screw extruders and replacement barrels and screws has been moved to our principal us plastics machinery facility near cincinnati  ohio 
in october   we acquired ontario heater and supply company and rite tek canada rite tek  two canadian companies that specialize in the distribution of maintenance  repair and operating supplies for the plastics processing industry 
rite tek also manufactures heater bands used in plastics processing 
the combined sales of the two companies were approximately million per year as of the date of the acquisitions 
in april   we acquired progress precision  a canadian manufacturer of barrels and screws and provider of related services for plastics extrusion  injection molding and blow molding 
progress precision has annual sales of approximately million 
also in april   we acquired reform flachstahl reform  a manufacturer of mold bases and plates for plastics injection molding headquartered in germany 
with annual sales of approximately million  reform also provides components  cooling products and tools for molds and mold making 
in may   we completed the acquisition of eoc normalien eoc  a german manufacturer of mold bases  components and die sets for plastics injection molding 
eoc has annual sales of approximately million 
with the exception of producto  oak and the micro carbide product line  all of the acquisitions that took place in through are included in the plastics technologies segment 
all of the acquisitions were financed through available cash and bank borrowings and have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
divestitures of businesses in december   we completed the sale of our european extrusion machinery business  which was headquartered in vienna  austria  for cash proceeds of million including post closing adjustments 
the pretax gain on the sale was million million after tax 
the european extrusion business had sales to unaffiliated customers of million in  principally to markets in europe  asia and south america 
the business was sold to redeploy assets to other more strategic businesses 
in september   we completed the sale of our german based industrial magnets business  widia magnet engineering  for approximately million and recorded a pretax gain of million 
million after tax 
for the first nine months of  widia magnet engineering  which manufactures and sells both soft and permanent magnets  had new orders and sales of million and million  respectively 
the business was included in the acquisition of widia gmbh in and was sold to redeploy assets to other businesses 
presence outside the us in recent years  milacron s growth outside the us has allowed it to become more globally balanced 
for  markets outside the us represented the following percentages of our consolidated sales europe  asia  canada and mexico  and the rest of the world 
as a result of this geographic mix  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the translation of our sales and earnings  as well as consolidated shareholders equity 
during  the weighted average exchange rate of the euro 
table of contents was weaker in relation to the us dollar than in as a result  milacron experienced unfavorable translation effects on new orders and sales of million 
the strength of the euro also adversely affected consolidated earnings before interest and taxes by million in and more than million in between december  and december   the euro weakened slightly against the dollar which resulted in a million reduction in consolidated shareholders equity due to unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments 
if the euro should weaken further against the us dollar in future periods  we will once again experience a negative effect in translating our european new orders  sales and earnings when compared to historical results 
significant accounting policies and judgments the consolidated financial statements discussed herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are included therein 
the following is a summary of certain accounting policies  estimates and judgmental matters that management believes are significant to milacron s reported financial position and results of operations 
additional accounting policies are described in the note captioned summary of significant accounting policies on pages through of this form k  which should be read in connection with the discussion that follows 
management regularly reviews its estimates and judgments and the assumptions regarding future events and economic conditions that serve as their basis 
while management believes the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements to be reasonable in the circumstances  the recorded amounts could vary under different conditions or assumptions 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december   milacron had significant deferred tax assets related principally to us and us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and to expenses that have been deducted for financial reporting purposes but which are not yet deductible for income tax reporting 
at december   we had provided valuation allowances against certain of these assets 
valuation allowances serve to reduce the recorded deferred tax assets to amounts reasonably expected to be realized as tax savings in the future 
the establishment of valuation allowances and their subsequent adjustment requires a significant amount of judgment because the realization of deferred tax assets particularly those assets related to net operating loss carryforwards is generally contingent on the generation of taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in the future 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  management considers its three year internal operating plans  which are based on the current economic environment  management s best estimate of future economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates  and the effect of potential economic changes on the company s various operations 
if management s current estimates and the related assumptions change in the future  milacron may be required to record new valuation allowances or increase the allowances that are already recorded which would result in additional income tax expense in the period of the change 
conversely  reductions of valuation allowances as a result of changes in estimates or assumptions would have a beneficial effect on milacron s provision for income taxes 
at december   milacron had a us net operating loss carryforward of million  which expires in  and related federal  state and local deferred tax assets of million 
no valuation allowances have been provided with respect to these assets because management believes the net operating loss carryforwards will be fully utilized prior to their expiration 
this judgment is based on the expectation of increased us industrial production and capital spending in the latter part of and on the significant reductions in milacron s cost structure that have been achieved in recent years and that will be achieved through the restructuring programs that began in see restructuring costs 
at december   milacron had non us operating loss carryforwards principally in germany totaling million and related deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances totaling million have been provided with respect to these assets 
management believes that it is more likely than not that portions of the net operating loss carryforwards in germany and other jurisdictions will be utilized 
however  the magnitude of the carryforwards in those countries makes it impossible to conclude at this time that no valuation allowances are required 
accounts receivable and inventory reserves milacron s internal accounting policies require that each of its operations maintain appropriate reserves for uncollectible receivables and inventory obsolescence in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
because of the diversity of milacron s customers and product lines  the specific procedures used to calculate these reserves vary by location but must conform to company 
table of contents guidelines 
reserves are required to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts are generally established using specific percentages of the gross receivables amounts based on their age as of a particular balance sheet date 
the amounts calculated through this process are then adjusted for known credit risks and collection problems 
write offs of accounts receivable have averaged million during the last three years 
while management believes that the company s reserves for doubtful accounts are reasonable in the circumstances  adverse changes in general economic conditions or in the financial condition of milacron s major customers could result in the need for additional reserves in the future 
reserves for inventory obsolescence are generally calculated by applying specific percentages to inventory carrying values based on the level of usage and sales in recent years 
these calculations are then adjusted based on current economic trends  expected product line changes  changes in customer requirements and other factors 
in  milacron recorded new inventory obsolescence reserves totaling million and utilized million of such reserves in connection with the disposal of obsolete inventory 
management believes that milacron s reserves are appropriate in light of its historical results and its assumptions regarding the future 
however  adverse economic changes or changes in customer requirements could necessitate the recording of additional reserves through charges to earnings in the future 
impairment of property  plant and equipment and goodwill milacron reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets and goodwill annually 
in and prior years  these reviews were conducted by comparing the estimates of undiscounted future cash flows that are included in milacron s three year internal operating plans to the carrying values of the related assets 
no growth in operating cash flows beyond the third year is assumed 
under this methodology  impairment would be deemed to exist if the carrying values exceeded the expected future cash flow amounts 
in  milacron reviewed the aggregate carrying values of selected groups of its long lived assets under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the assets included in these reviews consisted principally of property  plant and equipment and  where applicable  goodwill 
based on these reviews  it was determined that the maximum period of time to recover the carrying values of the tested groups of assets through undiscounted cash flows is approximately years and that the weighted average recovery period is approximately of the remaining average lives of the assets 
based on the results of the reviews  no impairment charges were recorded in the review for goodwill impairment was conducted as of september   using recorded balances and cash flow projections as of that date 
this review did not reveal any instances in which an impairment charge was required based on the methodology described above 
the maximum period of time to recover the carrying value of recorded goodwill through undiscounted cash flows was determined to be approximately years and the weighted average recovery period was approximately of the average remaining amortization period 
however  effective january   milacron will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this recently issued standard requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually using probability weighted cash flows discounted at market interest rates 
as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the section of this management s discussion and analysis captioned future change in method of accounting  the change from the undiscounted cash flow methodology described above to the use of discounted future cash flows will result in a significant non cash charge for goodwill impairment that will be recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in method of accounting 
it is expected that this charge will be recorded when the actual amount is determined around the middle of  retroactive to january  insurance reserves through its wholly owned insurance subsidiary  milacron assurance ltd 
mal  milacron is primarily self insured for many types of risks  including general liability  product liability  environmental claims and worker s compensation for certain domestic employees 
mal  which is incorporated in bermuda and is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of that jurisdiction  establishes reserves commensurate with known or estimated exposures under the policies it issues to milacron 
exposure for general and product liability claims is subject to reinsurance coverage and excess liability coverage 
worker s compensation claims in excess of certain limits are insured with commercial carriers 
at december   mal had reserves for known claims and incurred but not reported claims under all coverages totaling million 
this amount is included in long term accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at that date 
mal s reserves are established based on known claims and management s best estimates of the ultimate exposures thereunder and on estimates of the cost of 
table of contents incurred but not reported claims 
for certain types of exposures  mal and the company utilize actuarially calculated estimates prepared by outside consultants to ensure the adequacy of the reserves 
reserves are reviewed and adjusted quarterly based on all evidence available as of the respective balance sheet dates 
while the ultimate amount of mal s exposure to claims is dependent on future events that cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that the recorded reserves are adequate in the circumstances 
however  claims in excess of the recorded amounts may adversely affect earnings in the future when additional evidence becomes available 
pensions milacron maintains defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
the most significant of these plans is the principal defined benefit plan for us employees  which is also the only major plan that is funded 
in  milacron recorded pension income of million related to this plan and expense of million for the other plans 
the most significant factor in determining the amount of income recorded for the funded us plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in and in several preceding years  milacron has used an expected long term rate of return of and expects to use this rate again in despite the loss incurred in  over the last ten years the assets of the funded us plan have earned in excess of and management therefore believes that this rate continues to be appropriate 
in determining the amount of pension income to be recognized  the expected long term rate of return that is discussed above is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in fair value over a three year period 
this practice has the effect of reducing year to year volatility in recorded pension income 
however  recognition of the remainder of the loss will have the effect of reducing the return on plan assets component of milacron s pension income in and  in both cases in relation to moreover  additional asset related losses in and beyond would possibly require management to reduce the expected long term rate of return from the current to a lower amount  a change that would also reduce the amount of income in the future 
conversely  asset returns in excess of in future years could conceivably result in the use of a higher rate which would have the effect of increasing pension income 
compared to new orders and backlog consolidated new orders in were  million  a decrease of million  or  in relation to orders of  million in unfavorable currency effects and the sale of the industrial magnets business see divestitures of businesses contributed million to the decrease 
excluding these factors  consolidated orders decreased by more than 
orders for both segments were penalized by low rates of industrial production in north america 
orders for plastics processing machinery were also penalized by depressed levels of capital spending  a trend that can be expected to continue for all or most of while order levels in europe generally decreased to a lesser degree than in north america  economic conditions in that region began to soften in the latter part of the year 
orders for plastics technologies products totaled million for  a decrease of million  or  in relation to in north america  orders for injection molding machines and extrusion systems decreased by approximately due to low levels of industrial production and significantly reduced capital spending 
orders for injection molding machines also decreased in europe but to a lesser degree 
european orders for uniloy blow molding systems approximated the level achieved in but remained at depressed levels  while in north america  orders for uniloy systems decreased by more than 
orders for d m e mold bases and components increased in europe due to the acquisitions of eoc and reform see acquisitions 
however  orders for d m e products in north america decreased by more than due to low levels of industrial production and capacity utilization in the plastics processing industry 
in the metalworking technologies segment  orders for totaled million compared to million in this represents a decrease of million  or  that was due in part to the sale of the industrial magnets business  which had contributed million of orders in  and to the strength of the us dollar in relation to the euro and other currencies 
excluding the divestiture and currency effects  orders decreased by in relation to all of the segment s businesses experienced reduced order levels in north america due to low production levels in the metalworking industry 
the most significant decreases occurred in the valenite metalcutting tools business due in part to lower levels of automotive production and in the round metalcutting tools business due to lower demand from the aerospace industry 
in europe  orders for widia metalcutting tools increased both in local currencies and as measured in us dollars despite adverse currency effects 

table of contents european orders for metalworking fluids approximated the level achieved in consolidated us export orders totaled million in compared to million in the decrease resulted principally from lower export orders for valenite products and uniloy blow molding machinery 
milacron s backlog of unfilled orders totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease is due primarily to lower order levels for all types of plastics machinery in north america 
sales consolidated sales in were  million  a decrease of million  or  in relation to  million of sales in adverse currency effects of million and the sale of the industrial magnets business accounted for approximately of the decrease 
the remainder resulted principally from the low levels of industrial production in north america  the related decrease in capital spending and  to a lesser degree  a softening in economic conditions in europe in the latter part of the year 
sales of the plastics technologies segment were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the most significant decreases occurred in the segment s north american injection molding machine and extrusion systems businesses  where sales decreased by more than 
sales of uniloy blow molding systems also decreased in north america but to a somewhat lesser degree  as did shipments of injection molding machines in europe 
as was the case for new orders  european sales of blow molding equipment held steady in relation to but remained at low levels due to the restructuring and reorganization of uniloy s italian operations see margins  costs and expenses 
in the aggregate  worldwide sales of plastics processing machinery in decreased by to in relation to due to lower production levels and reduced capital spending 
order levels and shipments of milacron s machinery products can be expected to remain at low levels until the overall economy begins to recover  possibly later in we expect that increases in demand for our capital goods  however  will probably trail the general improvement in business conditions by a quarter or two 
in the segment s non machinery businesses  sales of d m e products decreased in north america due to low levels of capacity utilization and industrial production 
shipments of d m e products increased in europe due to the contributions of eoc and reform while worldwide sales of mro maintenance  repair and operating supplies approximated the level achieved in sales of the metalworking technologies segment were million in  a decrease of million in relation to million in the absence of the industrial magnets business and adverse currency effects accounted for more than one third of the decrease 
excluding these factors  sales decreased by in relation to in north america  sales of the segment s metalcutting products carbide inserts and tool holders  round tools and grinding wheels all decreased in relation to due to significantly lower levels of industrial production 
the largest decrease occurred in the valenite metalcutting tools business due in part to reduced automotive production 
us dollar shipments of widia products in europe increased by almost despite million of adverse currency effects that resulted from the comparative weakness of the euro 
shipments of metalworking fluids decreased in north america but held steady in relation to in europe 
consolidated us export sales were million in compared to million in reduced export shipments of injection molding machines  uniloy blow molding systems and valenite products were the principal reason for the million decrease 
sales of both segments to non us markets  including exports  totaled million in  compared to million in the decrease was caused principally by adverse currency effects  the sale of the industrial magnets business and reduced export shipments 
for and  products manufactured outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively  while products sold outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively 
margins  costs and expenses excluding restructuring costs related to product line discontinuation and other adjustments of inventory carrying values totaling million  our consolidated manufacturing margin in was compared to in including restructuring costs  manufacturing margins for were 
low sales volume and the related underabsorption of manufacturing costs penalized the margins of both segments  especially in the second half of the year 
as discussed below  problems arising from the reorganization of uniloy s italian operations also penalized the margins of the plastics technologies segment 
in addition  increases in the prices of certain raw materials used in the production of carbide metalcutting tools adversely affected the margins and profitability of the metalworking technologies segment for much of however  prices for these materials decreased somewhat late in the year 
in response to the general economic slowdown  we have continued to reduce production to meet lower levels of 
table of contents demand and implemented increasingly stringent cost reduction measures throughout our operations 
in the first two quarters of  we eliminated approximately positions in north america in response to low order and shipment levels 
during the third and fourth quarters  we announced plans to further reduce our cost structure and break even point by consolidating a number of smaller manufacturing facilities and further reduce general overhead levels see restructuring costs 
these actions in are in addition to the programs to improve operating efficiency that were initiated in and substantially completed in we are also making structural improvements in the way we run our businesses  including the use of six sigma and lean manufacturing techniques throughout our operations to reduce cycle times and working capital requirements 
as discussed more fully in the section of this management s discussion and analysis captioned restructuring costs  during the company completed an eighteen month long reorganization and restructuring of uniloy europe at a total cost of million 
due to the complexities of closing two manufacturing plants  including the relocation of employees  inventory and productive assets  we recorded an additional nonrecurring  non cash charge of million related to the writedown of certain assets in the fourth quarter of for  total selling and administrative expense decreased in amount in relation to due to a decrease in variable selling expenses that resulted from lower sales volume and from the aggressive cost reduction measures implemented in recent years 
as a percentage of sales  however  selling expense increased from to due in part to increased expense for bad debts 
administrative expense decreased by almost due principally to the benefits derived from the aforementioned cost reduction programs 
other expense net totaled million in compared to million in the amount for includes a pretax gain of million million after tax on the sale of surplus real estate  while the amount for includes million of revenue from the licensing of patented plastics processing technology 
for  net interest expense increased modestly as the beneficial effects of lower short term interest rates were offset by higher average debt levels 
restructuring costs in  we initiated two separate programs to improve operating efficiency and strengthen synergies between certain recently acquired businesses and our previously existing operations 
these actions had the effect of reducing pretax earnings in by million million after tax 
in september   we announced a formal plan to consolidate uniloy s european blow molding operations in a new manufacturing facility located near milan  italy at a cost of million including a reserve for employee termination benefits and facility exit costs that was established in the allocation of the uniloy acquisition cost 
the remainder of the cost of the consolidation was charged to expense as incurred  including 
million in in december   we initiated a second plan to improve operating efficiency and reduce costs at additional businesses 
the cost of implementing the plan was originally expected to be million  of which million was charged to earnings in the fourth quarter of however  lower than anticipated costs for employee  inventory and equipment relocation and for severance and other termination benefits reduced the actual cost to million 
the remainder of the total cost of the plan of million was charged to expense as incurred in as discussed more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in the third and fourth quarters of  milacron s management formally approved plans to consolidate additional operations and further reduce the company s cost structure 
implementation of these plans is expected to result in pretax charges to earnings of approximately million 
of the total expected cost of the plans  million was recorded in  including reserves totaling million for employee termination benefits and facility exit costs 
the amount for also includes 
million for supplemental early retirement benefits that will be funded through the company s principal us pension plan and million for product line discontinuation and certain other inventory write downs in both segments 
the remaining million of the expected total cost of the plans is being charged to expense as incurred  including million in and million in as approved by management  the plans involve the closure of twelve manufacturing facilities in north america  including five smaller south carolina facilities that will be consolidated in a new leased facility 
the plans also entail the elimination of several warehousing  sales and administrative locations worldwide 
the consolidation and overhead reductions will result in the elimination of approximately  manufacturing and administrative positions  principally in the us and europe 
the net cash cost of implementing the plans is expected to be approximately million  of which million was spent in substantially all of the remainder is expected to be spent in the first half of 
table of contents completion of the plans is expected to result in annual cost savings of more than million which began to phase in during the fourth quarter of and which are expected to be fully realized in during  the company s management also approved a plan to integrate the operations of eoc and reform with d m e s existing european mold base and components business at a total cost of approximately million 
of this amount  million relates to reserves for employee termination benefits and facility exit costs that are being recorded in the allocation of the eoc and reform acquisition costs 
the remaining million is being charged to expense  including million in the plan involves the consolidation of the manufacturing operations of five existing facilities located in germany and belgium into three facilities  the reorganization of warehousing and distribution activities in europe  and the elimination of approximately manufacturing and administrative positions 
of the total cost of the plan  million relates to the newly acquired eoc and reform businesses  including the million of reserves that are discussed above 
an additional million related to eoc and reform is being charged to expense as incurred  including 
million in as it relates to d m e  the total cost of the plan is expected to be million  including reserves of million for termination benefits and facility exit costs that were charged to expense in additional costs related to d m e totaling 
million are being expensed as incurred  including 
million in and 
million in the total cash cost of the consolidation plan is expected to be approximately million  of which million was spent in in total  milacron recorded restructuring charges of million in  including million for the eoc and reform integration and million for the other actions that are discussed above 
an additional million will be expensed in the total cash cost of the restructuring actions in was million 
additional spending in will total approximately million 
earnings loss before income taxes and minority shareholders interests for  milacron s loss before income taxes and minority shareholders interests was million compared to earnings of million in the amount for includes restructuring costs of million compared to million in excluding restructuring  milacron s pretax loss was million 
the same factors that caused the significant reductions in order levels and sales low levels of industrial production and significantly lower levels of capital spending in the plastics processing industry were the principal reasons for the adverse comparison to income taxes during  milacron recorded a net benefit related to income taxes due to the combined effects of operating losses in the us and a favorable effective tax rate for non us operations 
the losses incurred by our non us operations resulted in tax benefits based on the federal statutory rate and the company s effective tax rate for state and local tax purposes  in both cases adjusted for permanent differences and applicable credits 
the favorable tax rate for non us operations was due in part to adjustments of valuation allowances in germany as discussed below 
such adjustments offset provisions for income taxes at statutory rates in other profitable non us jurisdictions 
the consolidated effective tax rate also benefited from a favorable ruling from a non us taxing authority and the resolution of tax contingencies in other jurisdictions 
milacron entered both and with significant net operating loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions  along with valuation allowances against the carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and revised based on a more likely than not assessment of whether the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
increases or decreases in these valuation allowances serve to unfavorably or favorably affect our effective tax rate 
milacron s effective tax rate for was less than the federal statutory rate due principally to such adjustments of valuation allowances and to favorable rulings from various taxing authorities 
net earnings loss for  milacron had a net loss of million  or per share diluted  compared to net earnings of million  or per share diluted  in the loss includes after tax restructuring costs of million  or 
per share 
in  after tax restructuring costs were million  or 
per share 
excluding restructuring  milacron s loss for was million  or 
per share  compared to earnings of million  or per share  in future change in method of accounting as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  milacron will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 effective january  under sfas no 
 goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized but rather are reviewed annually for impairment 
application of the standard s nonamortization provisions is expected to result in an in 
table of contents crease in annual pretax earnings of approximately million million after tax beginning in during  milacron will complete the transitional reviews of the recorded balances of goodwill and certain other intangible assets as of january  that are required by sfas no 
based on our preliminary evaluations  these reviews are expected to result in a non cash pretax goodwill impairment charge of between million and million million and million after tax 
this charge will be recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in method of accounting when the actual amount is determined around the middle of  retroactive to january  compared to new orders and backlog consolidated new orders in were  million  a decrease of million  or  in relation to in  consolidated new orders included million related to our european extrusion systems business that was sold in december of that year 
the sale of our german based industrial magnets business in september   also had the effect of reducing new orders by million in relation to  while acquisitions contributed an incremental million 
excluding acquisitions and divestitures  consolidated orders were essentially flat in relation to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of reducing orders for the year by million 
excluding currency and the acquisition and divestiture effects  orders for the year increased by more than 
in the plastics technologies segment  new orders totaled million  a decrease of million in relation to that was due principally to the absence of the european extrusion systems business and unfavorable foreign currency effects that reduced orders by million 
excluding the divestiture and the contribution of the acquisitions made in and  the segment s orders decreased by 
excluding the aforementioned adverse currency effects in addition to acquisitions and divestitures  orders increased by more than 
orders for injection molding machines increased in both north america and europe 
orders for us built extrusion systems decreased modestly but remained at good levels 
orders for uniloy blow molding systems also decreased due in part to the ongoing consolidation of the dairy industry in north america 
orders for metalworking technologies products totaled million in  representing only a modest decrease in relation to despite unfavorable currency effects of million 
excluding the effects of currency  the sale of the industrial magnets business and the segment s acquisitions  orders for the year increased by 
orders for metalworking fluids increased worldwide but especially in north america due to the expanded product offerings that resulted from the acquisitions 
orders for valenite metalcutting tools increased in north america  as did orders for widia products in europe as measured in local currencies 
orders for round tools decreased slightly due in part to currency effects 
us export orders totaled million in compared to million in the decrease resulted principally from lower export orders for injection molding machines and uniloy products 
the company s backlog of unfilled orders was million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease is due principally to continuing low order levels for uniloy blow molding systems and lower fourth quarter   demand for injection molding machines and us built extrusion systems 
sales consolidated sales in were  million  representing a million  or  decrease in relation to sales of  million 
unfavorable currency effects reduced consolidated sales by million 
in  consolidated sales included million related to the european extrusion systems business 
excluding the effects of the sales of this business and the industrial magnets business as well as acquisitions  consolidated sales increased by 
however  excluding currency effects in addition to acquisitions and divestitures  sales increased by more than in relation to sales of the plastics technologies segment were million in compared to million in the absence of the european extrusion systems business more than accounted for the decrease 
excluding the effects of the divestiture and the contribution of the segment s recent acquisitions  sales increased by 
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate effects reduced sales by million in relation to adjusting for currency effects and for acquisitions and the divestiture  sales for the year increased by more than 
sales of injection molding machines increased in both north america and europe  the latter despite adverse currency effects 
sales of us built extrusion systems also increased for the year despite a modest decrease in the fourth quarter  but sales of uniloy blow molding systems decreased worldwide due to the dairy industry consolidation in north america and lower shipments to european and asian markets 
sales of metalworking technologies products were million in  representing only a modest decrease of million in relation to million in despite unfavorable currency effects of million and the sale of 
table of contents the widia industrial magnets business in september  excluding these factors and the contribution of the segment s acquisitions  sales for the year increased by more than 
sales of metalworking fluids increased worldwide while sales of valenite metalcutting products in north america and round tools worldwide approximated the levels achieved in sales of widia products in europe increased in local currencies but decreased as measured in us dollars due to the strength of the dollar in relation to the euro and other currencies 
consolidated export sales were million in  compared to million in the decrease resulted principally from lower export shipments of uniloy products and  to a lesser degree  injection molding machines 
sales of both segments to non us markets totaled million in  a decrease of million that was due principally to currency effects and the aforementioned divestitures 
in and  products manufactured outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively  while products sold outside the us approximated of sales in and in margins  costs and expenses the consolidated manufacturing margin was in compared to in  as both segments approximated the results achieved in in the plastics technologies segment  lower margins for uniloy products  particularly in europe  offset the effect of margin improvements for injection molding machines and extrusion systems 
the overall margin for the metalworking technologies segment decreased modestly due to lower margins for grinding wheels and metalworking fluids  the latter being due in part to higher oil prices 
total selling and administrative expense decreased in amount and as a percentage of sales in due in part to our aggressive cost reduction efforts that began in and continued in selling expense decreased by million from of sales to of sales 
administrative expenses for the year decreased by million 
other expense net decreased from million in to million in due to increased royalty income from the licensing of patented plastics processing technology and higher gains on the disposal of surplus property and equipment 
these benefits were partially offset by higher goodwill amortization expense and increased costs related to the sale of receivables 
interest expense net increased in due primarily to higher short term interest rates despite lower average debt levels 
restructuring costs in  we initiated two separate programs to improve operating efficiency and strengthen synergies between certain recently acquired businesses and our previously existing operations 
in september   we announced a formal plan to consolidate uniloy s european blow molding operations in a new manufacturing facility located near milan  italy 
at the time uniloy was acquired in september   we recognized the need for improved efficiency within uniloy s european operations and immediately thereafter began to evaluate various options for the purpose of identifying the optimal long term solution 
through that process  it was determined that certain of the manufacturing and assembly operations at the plants located in florence and milan  italy and berlin  germany would be consolidated into a more modern plant near milan and that other operations would be transferred to another plant located in the czech republic 
in the second quarter of  we began to develop a detailed plan for the consolidation  which was formally approved by management in august  the total cost of the plan  which was initiated in the fourth quarter of and which was completed in  was originally expected to be approximately million 
however  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations since the acquisition date and lower than expected costs to relocate inventory and equipment had the effect of reducing the total cost as measured in us dollars to approximately million  including 
million that was charged to expense as incurred 
of the latter amount  
million was expensed in the remainder of the total cost of the consolidation was included in a reserve for employee termination benefits and facility exit costs that was established in the allocation of the uniloy acquisition cost 
the original amount of the reserve was million but foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of reducing it by

million in charges against the reserve in were million 
the total cash cost of the consolidation is ultimately expected to be approximately million  which is net of the expected proceeds from the sale of two facilities in italy  one of which was sold in the consolidation reduced revenues in but did not adversely affect revenues by the second half of completion of the consolidation has resulted in annual pretax cost savings of approximately million  which began to phase in during the second quarter of in december   we initiated a second plan to improve operating efficiency and reduce costs at additional businesses 
the actions included in the plan involved both segments operations in north america and europe 
the 
table of contents plan involved the closure of four smaller manufacturing facilities  the operations of which were transferred to other locations  and the elimination of approximately manufacturing and administrative positions worldwide  substantially all of which had been eliminated as of december  the cost of implementing the plan was originally expected to be million 
however  as a result of lower than expected costs for employee  inventory and equipment relocation and to a significantly lesser degree lower severance and other termination benefits  the total cost was million  including million in and million in of the amount  million was included in a reserve for employee termination benefits and facility exit costs that was recorded in the fourth quarter 
charges against this reserve in totaled million 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of reducing the reserve by an additional 
million 
in addition  excess reserves for employee termination benefits and facility exit costs totaling 
million were reversed in the third and fourth quarters of the total cost of the plan also included charges of million for supplemental early retirement benefits for certain employees that are being funded through pension plans and million for additional costs that were charged to expense as incurred 
of the latter amount  million was expensed in the total cash cost of the plan  including capital expenditures of million  was approximately million  most of which was expended in completion of the plan has resulted in annual pretax cost savings of more than million  which phased in during and which were fully realized in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and minority shareholders interests earnings before income taxes and minority shareholders interests were million in compared to million in the amount includes a pretax gain of million on the sale of the industrial magnets business and restructuring costs of million related to the programs that were initiated in pretax earnings for includes a gain of million on the sale of the european extrusion systems business and restructuring costs of million 
excluding these items  pretax earnings in approximated the results achieved in income taxes the provision for income taxes in and includes us federal and state and local income taxes and income taxes in other jurisdictions outside the us milacron entered both and with sizable net operating loss carryforwards in certain non us jurisdictions  along with valuation allowances against the carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
we review valuation allowances periodically based on the relative amount of positive and negative evidence available at the time 
this is done for the purpose of reaching conclusions regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are then adjusted accordingly 
the resulting decreases or increases in valuation allowances serve to favorably or unfavorably affect our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate for was compared to in the rate for is lower than the us federal statutory rate due principally to the reversal of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions and the adjustment of income tax reserves to more accurately reflect actual expected liabilities as a result of favorable rulings and resolutions from various taxing authorities 
these benefits were partially offset by the downward adjustment of the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets in germany to a lower rate as a result of a tax law change in that country 
adjustments of valuation allowances did not have a material effect on the effective tax rate for however  the effective rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily as a result of tax reserve adjustments 
net earnings for  net earnings were million  or per share diluted  compared to million  or per share diluted  for the percentage increase in per share earnings exceeds the percentage increase in net earnings due to fewer common shares outstanding in as a result of our common share repurchase program which is discussed below 
the net earnings and earnings per share amounts for include after tax restructuring costs of million  or

excluding all of the aforementioned items  net earnings increased from million in to million in market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk milacron uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to firm commitments arising from international transactions 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
at december   milacron had outstanding forward contracts totaling million compared to million at december  the annual potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange 
table of contents rates on milacron s foreign exchange contracts at december  or december   would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
interest rate risk at december   milacron had fixed interest rate debt of million  including million of notes due may   and million million of eurobonds due april  we also had floating rate debt totaling million  with interest fluctuating based primarily on changes in libor 
at december   fixed rate debt totaled million  and floating rate debt totaled million 
we also sell up to million of accounts receivable under our receivables purchase agreement  which results in financing fees that fluctuate based on changes in commercial paper rates 
as a result  annual interest expense and financing fees fluctuate based on changes in short term borrowing rates 
the potential loss on floating rate debt from a hypothetical increase in interest rates would be approximately million at december   and million at december  liquidity and sources of capital at december   milacron had cash and cash equivalents of million  representing an increase of million in relation to december  in  operating activities provided million of cash compared to million of cash provided in the amount for includes the negative effects of a million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold under our receivables purchase agreement whereas sales of additional receivables provided million of cash in in  cash flow from operations benefited from reductions in accounts receivable that resulted from lower sales volume and significant reductions in inventories that were achieved through our working capital reduction plan 
these effects were partially offset by reductions in trade payables and other current liabilities that were related to lower production volumes 
in  investing activities resulted in a million use of cash  including million for acquisitions and million for capital expenditures 
investing activities used million of cash in  including million for capital additions and million for acquisitions 
together  the proceeds from the sale of the industrial magnets business and the disposal of surplus property  plant and equipment provided million of cash in during  financing activities provided million of cash compared to million of cash used in in  net additional borrowings provided million of cash which was partially offset by net common share repurchases of million 
the amount for includes million for common shares repurchases and million for repayments of debt  including million for the repayment of notes due may  using the proceeds from a million million eurobond debt offering that was completed on april  dividends of million and million were paid in and  respectively 
in the first quarter of  milacron s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to four million common shares on the open market 
during  we repurchased million shares under this authorization 
an additional 
million shares were repurchased during bringing the total to million 
no additional repurchases are planned at this time 
as of december   milacron s current ratio was  compared to at december  total shareholders equity was million at december   a decrease of million from december  the decrease resulted principally from the net loss incurred during the year 
the ratio of total debt to total capital debt plus equity was at december  compared to at december  the company s debt and lease obligations for and beyond are shown in the table that follows 
debt and lease obligations after in millions long term debt revolving credit facility other lines of credit total debt obligations operating leases total debt and lease obligations note for  the above table excludes million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million of borrowings under other lines of credit that the company may  but is not currently obligated to  repay in 
table of contents these amounts are included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at december  the table also excludes contingent liabilities of up to million related to sales of receivables and loan guarantees 
our ability to satisfy our obligations and our other liquidity needs is a function of a number of factors  the most important of which include our available cash and cash equivalents  our continued ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and other lines of credit  our ability to continue to utilize our receivables purchase agreement  the cash cost of our restructuring program and our cash flow from operating activities 
we began with cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
at december   milacron had lines of credit with various us and non us banks totaling approximately million  including a million committed revolving credit facility 
at december   million was drawn against the facility  including outstanding letters of credit of million 
the facility matures in june  the facility limits the payment of cash dividends and imposes certain restrictions on  among other things  share repurchases  capital expenditures and cash acquisitions 
the facility also includes a number of financial covenants 
at december   milacron was in compliance with these covenants 
effective march   the revolving credit facility was amended to  among other things  adjust certain financial covenants including suspension of the leverage test ratio of net debt to ebitda  in both cases as defined below for the first two quarters of under the terms of the amended agreement  the maximum borrowing under the facility reduces from million to million at june  and million at december  the amended agreement includes a number of financial and other covenants  including those which require milacron to achieve specified minimum levels of quarterly ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and maintain certain ratios of net debt debt less cash and cash equivalents to ebitda and limit the incurrence of new debt 
if the amended facility had been in effect as of january   in addition to the million of cash and cash equivalents  the company would have been able to borrow approximately million in additional funds under the facility and up to million from other lines of credit 
the facility also allows for over million of additional indebtedness from other sources 
for  the company s significant cost cutting actions coupled with an expected modest  gradual improvement in business conditions cause the company to believe that operating earnings will increase  which should allow us to continue to meet the covenants 
however  if unforeseen market conditions develop or the company is otherwise unable to meet the covenants  it is possible that it would not be in compliance 
in that event  we would attempt to renegotiate the covenants with the bank group to assure compliance 
however  our lenders actions are not controllable by us and if the renegotiations were not successful  the company could be placed in default under the agreement  which would allow the lenders to declare the outstanding borrowings currently due and collectible 
in addition  due to cross default provisions in milacron s other agreements  over of our other debt could become payable in full and our receivables purchase program as discussed below could be terminated if we were in default under the credit facility 
were these events to occur  we would experience a material adverse impact on our reported liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  as of december   we had a number of other credit lines totaling million  of which million was used and million was unused 
during the first half of  we expect to repay approximately million of borrowings that were outstanding at december  under the terms of the revolving credit facility as amended  increases in debt are primarily limited to current lines of credit and certain other indebtedness from other sources 
subsequent to june   the company s borrowing capacity is also limited by a leverage test based on future levels of ebitda 
the company expects to be in compliance with this covenant when it becomes effective  and based on current expectations  this test would not limit access to the additional borrowings described above 
another important source of liquidity is our accounts receivable purchase program 
although the agreement could be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events  some of which may be beyond our control  we expect to continue to be able to use the program for the foreseeable future 
at december   only million of the million facility was utilized due to the low level of accounts receivable that resulted from lower sales volume 
as the amount of eligible accounts receivable increases due to improved business conditions  we expect to utilize the remaining availability under the facility 
milacron expects to generate positive cash flow from operating activities in despite the use of approximately million of cash to complete the restructuring program that was initiated in the third quarter of we also expect to use million of cash for capital expenditures 
assuming there is no further significant deterioration in the markets we serve  we believe that milacron s current cash position  cash flow from operations  available credit lines and capacity to sell receivables will be sufficient to 
table of contents meet the company s operating and capital requirements in cautionary statement milacron wishes to caution readers about all of the forward looking statements in the management s discussion and analysis section and elsewhere 
these include all statements that speak about the future or are based on our interpretation of factors that might affect our businesses 
milacron believes the following important factors  among others  could affect its actual results in and beyond and cause them to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements global and regional economic conditions  consumer spending and industrial production  particularly in segments related to the level of automotive production and spending in the construction industry  fluctuations in currency exchange rates of us and foreign countries  including countries in europe and asia where milacron has several principal manufacturing facilities and where many of our competitors and suppliers are based  milacron s continued ability to borrow under its lines of credit and sell accounts receivable under its receivables purchase agreement  fluctuations in interest rates which affect the cost of borrowing under milacron s lines of credit and financing costs related to the sale of domestic accounts receivable  production and pricing levels of important raw materials  including plastic resins  which are a key material used by purchasers of milacron s plastics technologies products  steel  oil  cobalt  tungsten  tantalum carbide and industrial grains used in the production of metalworking products  lower than anticipated levels of plant utilization resulting in production inefficiencies and higher costs  whether related to the delay of new product introductions  improved production processes or equipment  or labor relations issues  customer acceptance of new products introduced during and additional new products that will be introduced in  any major disruption in production at key customer or supplier facilities or at milacron s facilities  disruptions in global or regional commerce due to social  civil or political unrest in the non us countries in which milacron operates  alterations in trade conditions in and between the us and us countries where milacron does business  including export duties  import controls  quotas and other trade barriers  disruptions in global and regional commerce due to acts of terrorism  continued threats of terrorism and military  political and economic responses including heightened security measures to terrorism  changes in tax  environmental and other laws and regulations in the us and non us countries where milacron does business  unanticipated litigation  claims or assessments  including but not limited to claims or problems related to product liability  warranty or environmental issues
