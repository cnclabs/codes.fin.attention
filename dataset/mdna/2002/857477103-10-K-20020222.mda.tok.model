note t o f f b a l a n c e s h e e t f i n a n c i a l i n s t r u m e n t s  i n c l u d i n g d e r i v a t i v e s state street uses derivatives to support clients needs  conduct trading activities  and manage its interest rate and currency risk 
the corporation assumes positions in both the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using financial derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange and interest rate options  and interest rate swaps 
an off balance sheet derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract which has one or more underlyings and one or more notional amounts  no initial net investment  or a smaller initial net investment than would be expected for similar types of contracts  and which requires or permits net settlement 
derivative instruments include forwards  futures  swaps  options and other instruments with similar characteristics 
the use of these instruments generates fee or interest revenue 
interest rate contracts involve an agreement with a counterparty to exchange cash flows based on the movement of an underlying interest rate index 
an interest rate swap agreement involves the exchange of a series of interest payments  either at a fixed or variable rate  based upon the notional amount without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
an interest rate option contract provides the purchaser  for a premium  the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell the underlying financial instrument at a set price at or during a specified period 
an interest rate futures contract is a commitment to buy or sell  at a future date  a financial instrument at a contracted price  it may be settled in cash or through the delivery of the contracted instrument 
foreign exchange contracts involve an agreement to exchange one currency for another currency at an agreed upon rate and settlement date 
foreign exchange contracts consist of swap agreements and forward and spot contracts 
the following table summarizes the contractual or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments held or issued for trading and balance sheet management at december dollars in millions trading interest rate contracts swap agreements options and caps purchased options and caps written futures short position options on futures purchased options on futures written foreign exchange contracts forward  swap and spot options purchased options written balance sheet management interest rate contracts swap agreements in connection with its interest rate risk management strategies  state street has executed interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of billion at december   designated as fair value hedges to hedge the changes in the fair value of certain securities 
for the year ended december   state street recognized net pre tax losses of approximately million  which represented the ineffective portion of the hedge 
in addition  state street has designated interest rate swaps with a notional value of million as cash flow hedges to its floating rate debt 
these interest rate swaps constitute a fully effective hedge 
state street s risk exposure from interest rate and foreign exchange contracts results from the possibility that one party may default on its contractual obligation or from movements in exchange or interest rates 
credit risk is limited to the positive market value of the derivative financial instrument  which is significantly less than the notional value 
the notional value provides the basis for determining the exchange of contractual cash flows 
the exposure to credit loss can be estimated by calculating the cost  on a present value basis  to replace at current market rates all profitable contracts at year end 
the estimated aggregate replacement cost of derivative financial instruments in a net positive position was billion at december   and billion at december the foreign exchange contracts have been reduced by offsetting balances with the same counterparty where a master netting agreement exists 
the following table represents the fair value as of december  and average fair value for the years ended december  of financial instruments held or issued for trading purposes dollars in millions fair value average fair value foreign exchange contracts contracts in a receivable position contracts in a payable position other financial instrument contracts contracts in a receivable position contracts in a payable position foreign exchange contracts contracts in a receivable position contracts in a payable position other financial instrument contracts contracts in a receivable position contracts in a payable position net foreign exchange trading revenue related to foreign exchange contracts was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for other financial instrument contracts  there was a loss of million in  a loss of million in and a gain of million in future cash requirements  if any  related to foreign currency contracts are represented by the gross amount of currencies to be exchanged under each contract unless state street and the counterparty have agreed to pay or receive the net contractual settlement amount on the settlement date 
future cash requirements on other financial instruments are limited to the net amounts payable under the agreements 
credit related financial instruments include indemnified securities on loan  commitments to extend credit or purchase assets  standby letters of credit  and letters of credit 
the maximum credit risk associated with credit related financial instruments is measured by the contractual amounts of these instruments 
on behalf of its clients  state street lends their securities to creditworthy brokers and other institutions 
in certain circumstances  state street may indemnify its clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
state street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
the borrowed securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary 
state street held  as collateral  cash and us government securities totaling billion and billion for indemnified securities on loan at december  and  respectively 
loan commitments unfunded loans and unused lines of credit  asset purchase agreements  standby letters of credit and letters of credit are issued to accommodate the financing needs of state street s clients and to provide credit enhancements to special purpose entities 
loan commitments are agreements by state street to lend monies at a future date 
asset purchase agreements are commitments to purchase receivables or securities  subject to conditions established in the agreements  and at december   include billion outstanding to special purpose entities 
standby letters of credit and letters of credit commit state street to make payments on behalf of clients and special purpose entities when certain specified events occur 
standby letters of credit outstanding to special purpose entities were million at december  these loan  asset purchase and letter of credit commitments are subject to the same credit policies and reviews as loans 
the amount and nature of collateral are obtained based upon management s assessment of the credit risk 
approximately of the loan commitments and asset purchase agreements expire within one year from the date of issue 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the following is a summary of the contractual amount of credit related  off balance sheet financial instruments at december dollars in millions indemnified securities on loan loan commitments asset purchase agreements standby letters of credit letters of credit note u f a i r v a l u e o f f i n a n c i a l i n s t r u m e n t s state street uses the following methods to estimate the fair value of financial instruments 
for financial instruments that have quoted market prices  those quotes are used to determine fair value 
financial instruments that have no defined maturity  have a remaining maturity of days or less  or reprice frequently to a market rate are assumed to have a fair value that approximates reported book value  after taking into consideration any applicable credit risk 
if no market quotes are available  financial instruments are valued by discounting the expected cash flow s using an estimated current market interest rate for the financial instrument 
for off balance sheet derivative instruments  fair value is estimated as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the short maturity of state street s assets and liabilities results in a significant number of financial instruments whose fair value equals or closely approximates reported balance sheet value 
such financial instruments are reported in the following balance sheet captions cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits with banks  securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed  federal funds sold  deposits  securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased and other short term borrowings 
the fair value of trading account assets equals the carrying value 
as of december  and  the net fair value of interest rate contracts used for balance sheet management was a liability of million and an asset of million  respectively 
there is no reported cost for loan commitments since terms are at prevailing market rates 
the reported value and fair value for other balance sheet captions at december are as follows dollars in millions reported value fair value investment securities available for sale held to maturity net loans excluding leases long term debt investment securities available for sale held to maturity net loans excluding leases long term debt note v n o n u

due to the nature of state street s business  it is not possible to segregate precisely us and us activities 
subjective judgments have been used to arrive at the operating results for non us activities  including the application of tax transfer pricing and asset liability management policies 
interest expense allocations are based on the average cost of short term borrowed funds 
state street does not allocate costs related to resources common to non us and non us activities
