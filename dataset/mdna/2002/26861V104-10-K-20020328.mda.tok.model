cautionary statements and risk factors this section is written to be responsive to the securities and exchange commission s plain english guidelines 
in this section the words we  our  ours and us refer only to equity marketing  inc and its subsidiaries and not any other person 
set forth below and elsewhere in this form k and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are important risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results of operations  business and financial condition to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this form k 
we depend significantly on one key customer our success is largely dependent on a single customer  burger king  which accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
burger king has no contractual commitment to do business with us 
there can be no assurance that burger king will do business with us in the future 
the termination or a significant reduction by burger king of its business with us would adversely affect our business 
the burger king business is also subject to significant year to year variability 
for instance  the company s revenues generated by its business with burger king dropped from  in to  in the success of our business with burger king is also partially dependent on the overall success of the burger king system  which sales could be negatively impacted by such factors as increased competition  a change in ownership  product recalls or bovine spongiform encephalopathy  commonly known as mad cow disease 
see business equity promotions and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we rely on a limited number of nonrenewable product orders a large portion of our revenues come from a relatively limited number of promotional programs by burger king  which promotions are in effect for only a limited period of time and generally are not repeated 
we must continually develop and sell new products and services for utilization in new promotional programs as part of burger king s annual promotions calendar see business equity promotions 
many consumer products are successfully marketed for only one or two years as a result of changing consumer preferences 
accordingly  our consumer products business depends on the ability to develop and market new products associated with new entertainment properties or proprietary concepts 
there can be no assurance that any new retail product line will be successful see business equity consumer products 
the cancellation or premature termination of one or more retail product lines or promotional programs  because of our inability to renew or extend licenses which typically have terms of three years or less on favorable terms or otherwise  or a significant change in promotional practices within the quick service restaurant industry  could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we or our customers will be able to secure licenses for additional entertainment properties on which to base our promotional and consumer products or that  if secured  such licenses will result in successful products 

table of contents we face the risk of product liability claims products that we develop or sell may expose us to liability from claims by users of such products for damages including  but not limited to  bodily injury or property damage 
we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are adequate 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such coverage or obtain additional coverage on acceptable terms in the future  or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims 
we face the risk of product recalls products that we develop or sell may expose us to liability for the costs related to product recalls 
these costs can include legal expenses  advertising  collection and destruction of product  and free goods 
our product liability insurance coverage generally excludes such costs and damages resulting from product recall 
we face credit risk we regularly extend credit to several distribution companies in connection with our business with burger king 
failure by one or more distribution companies to honor their payment obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our future operating results are difficult to predict we experience significant quarter to quarter variability in our revenues and net income 
the promotions business tends to include larger promotions in the summer and during the winter holiday season 
major movie and television release schedules also vary year to year  influencing the promotional schedules of our customers  as well as the particular promotions for which we are retained 
the motion picture or television characters on which the promotions business is often based may only be popular for short periods of time or not at all 
there may not be comparable popular characters or similar promotional campaigns in the future 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock may fall significantly 
the success of our products depends on the popularity of licensed materials our promotional and consumer products are typically based on entertainment properties  such as characters from current motion pictures or television programs 
the success of these products depends on the popularity of the entertainment properties on which they are based 
each motion picture and television program is an individual artistic work  and its commercial success is dependent on unpredictable consumer preferences 
often we spend substantial resources in securing licenses and developing and manufacturing products prior to a release of the motion picture or television program upon which the products are based 
our customers  such as burger king  typically require delivery schedules that coincide with the release of the underlying entertainment properties 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if the entertainment properties upon which our products are based turn out to be less popular than we anticipate 
also  delays in the release of motion pictures or television programs could result in delays or cancellations of our promotions 
see business equity promotions 
our markets are highly competitive the markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive 
our competitors  and in many cases their parent companies  include companies which have far more extensive sales and development staffs and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against such companies 
we rely on foreign manufacturers during  approximately of our products were manufactured in china 
foreign manufacturing is subject to a number of risks  including transportation delays and interruptions  political and economic disruptions  the imposition of tariffs  quotas and other import or export controls  and changes in governmental policies 
we face foreign currency risk as part of our business  we enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of products with entities in foreign countries 
while the vast majority of our contracts are denominated in us dollars  significant fluctuations in the local currencies of the entities with whom we transact business may adversely affect these entities abilities to fulfill their obligations under their contracts 

table of contents logistix enters into contracts denominated primarily in us dollars  british pounds sterling and euro s 
although the company attempts to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of certain hedging techniques  changes in such exchange rates may result in changes in the value of the company s commitments and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
there are risks associated with acquisitions if we are presented with appropriate opportunities  we intend to make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions or investment 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s personnel and operations 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
if we make other types of acquisitions  we could have difficulty in assimilating the acquired technology or products into our operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities and or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition
