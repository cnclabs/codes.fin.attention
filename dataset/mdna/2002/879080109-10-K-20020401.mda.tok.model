these forward looking statements are subject to factors beyond the control of the company such as weather and market and economic forces and  with respect to the company s future development of our land  the availability of financing and the ability to obtain various governmental entitlements 
no assurance can be given that the actual future results will not differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
overview we intend to continue focusing on increasing revenues and improving net income by expanding our real estate development activities 
we are currently working to take advantage of existing resources and market conditions as well as to anticipate and create future market trends and demand 
part of this effort includes evaluating our land and water resources and planning our real estate development activities based upon the evaluation 

in the future  we will continue to assess the feasibility of entering into complementary  new  related lines of business and refining or reconfiguring current core businesses to take advantage of opportunities presented and changing market conditions 
results of operations as reflected in the accompanying financial statements  we had net income of  in  a net loss of  in  and net income of  in net income for improved when compared to due primarily to higher operating profits within the real estate division  increased interest income  and lower interest expenses 
net income for declined when compared to due primarily to reduced operating profits from farming  increased real estate expenses and higher interest expenses 
net income for consists of income from continuing operations of  and income from discontinued operations of  net income for consisted of a loss from continuing operations of  and income from discontinued operations of  a significant portion of the income from discontinued operations resulted from the sale of assets 
real estate 
real estate segment operating profits of  in are  or higher than segment profits 
the improvement in segment profits is due to a slight increase in revenues and to lower expenses 
the slight improvement in revenues is due to an increase in oil and mineral income of  equity in earnings from our investment in petro travel plaza llc of  increased lease income from our portfolio of properties of  and additional milestone payments for use of land  easements  and services provided related to the calpine power plant project of  these gains in real estate revenue were partially offset by the sale of land for  and the settlement of an easement payment for  during expenses declined  in due to no cost of sales and commissions associated with the sale of land and to lower indirect real estate project expenses 
these improvements were partially offset by higher staffing costs and marketing costs during the equity in earnings from our investment in petro travel plaza for is due to a continued increase in customers  improved margins on diesel and gasoline sales as our cost of sales declined throughout the year  and improved cost controls 
cash flows continued to improve during and expectations are for continued growth in the future as the tejon industrial complex continues to grow and as more travelers and trucking professionals place petro on their refueling schedules 
in future years  the real estate division will continue to see increases in costs  net of amounts capitalized  primarily related to professional service fees  planning costs  entitlement costs  and staffing costs as we continue to increase real estate activities and pursue development opportunities 
the actual timing and completion of entitlement and development related activities is difficult to predict due to the unpredictability of the approval process and market factors 
these types of real estate development activities and costs could continue over several years as we develop our land holdings 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for our land holdings 
future sales of land are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
our goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial  industrial  resort and residential programs 
real estate segment profit of  in is  less than segment profit 
the decline in segment profit was due to increased revenues being more than offset by higher real estate expenses 
revenues grew  when compared to this growth was due to higher oil and mineral revenues of  the sale of land to ikea for  an increase in revenues from the power plant project of  settlement of an easement transaction for  and an improvement in leasing revenues 
these revenue improvements were partially offset by revenues in of  related to the sale of a fiber optic communications easement 
real estate expenses increased  during when compared to the increase in expenses were due to higher professional service fees of  an increase in fixed water costs of  and commissions and cost of sales totaling  related to the ikea land sale 
these costs were partially offset by a  improvement in our share of the net loss at the petro travel plaza joint venture 
the increase in professional service fees continued to be related to our increased real estate development and entitlement activities 
the equity in earnings from our investment in the petro travel plaza joint venture improved during due to higher fuel sales  increased volume at its convenience store  and higher restaurant revenues 
these improvements  however  could not offset the higher cost of sales during the year due to the significant increase in oil and gas prices 
see part i  item business real estate operations for a further discussion of and future planning activities 
farming 
during  the farming division sustained a loss of  a decrease of  when compared to segment profits 
the decline during is due to a decrease in grape revenues of  lower almond revenues of  reduced rental revenues of  and increased fixed water costs of  these unfavorable variances were partially offset by increased pistachio revenues of  and walnut revenues increasing  grape revenues continued to decline during due to lower prices and to reduced production 
grape prices declined approximately when compared to prices 
grape production declined due primarily to the removal of acres of unprofitable cabernet sauvignon grapes 
the overall decline in grape prices is directly related to the growth in production throughout california 
the growth in grape production within california could continue to impact grape prices well into the future 
improved prices will be realized only if there is increased demand for wine and grape products and or there is a significant reduction in the number of acres used for grape production in california 
we have been in discussions with several wineries regarding production contracts for and future years  but due to the pricing pressure on grapes  the wineries are currently not interested in long term contracts for all of our grapes 
we have  however  contracted our french colombard grape production for a two year period beginning with the crop and signed a multi year contract beginning in for our ruby cabernet grape production 
if we have no grape contracts in  for our remaining grape varieties  we will market our grapes to various wineries and the prices received will be driven by the wineries expectations regarding demand for their products and grape production 
during  based on discussions with the wineries  we learned that there was little interest in purchasing the cabernet grapes that we grew at that time 
based on that information  we removed acres of fully depreciated cabernet grape acreage in order to save the cultural costs associated with growing the grapes 
in place of the cabernet grapes  we planted acres of pistachio trees to take advantage of the irrigation systems in place  and provide for future revenue sources for our farming division 
almond revenues during declined due to a large drop in production 
the decline in production is due to storms that impacted the pollination period and to storm damage to trees 
the damaged trees were ultimately removed due to the damage sustained in the storms and to the age of the damaged trees 
we currently plan to plant acres of new almonds during to help offset the loss of future production from the removed trees 
pistachio revenues increased in due to production doubling when compared to production 
a large part of the increase in production was due to acres of young pistachio trees producing their first full crop 
the improvement in walnut revenues is due primarily to increased production 
industry expectations are that statewide nut crop yields should continue to improve  which may negatively impact prices 
we continue to expect pricing pressure on our almonds over the next few years due to new statewide plantings beginning to produce higher volumes of almonds 
this increase in production may be somewhat negated by old almond orchards being removed due to the current low prices for almonds 
this potential increase in overall almond production will positively impact our almond processing operation because of more almonds being available to process 
all of our crops are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
segment profits within the farming division during were  a decrease of  when compared to segment profits 
the decrease in segment profits was due primarily to lower grape revenues of  lower walnut revenues of  and higher cultural costs of  these unfavorable variances were partially offset by the net profits from the almond processing plant of  increased almond revenues of  higher pistachio revenues of  and lower fixed water costs of  the decrease in grape revenues was due to receiving lower prices for grapes than in prices for our grapes declined approximately during when compared to this decline in prices was due to increased grape production within california 
almond revenues in increased due to a increase in prices resulting from lower crop production within california 
pistachio revenues were higher due to an increase in production as prices remained comparable to the prior year 
walnut revenues declined due to a decrease in production and the reversal of revenue associated with the crop because estimated prices for were greater than what we were actually paid 
farming segment profits included results from our almond processing plant that we purchased in january this plant processes  hulls  and shells almonds for ourselves and outside customers 
cultural costs grew during when compared to due to new acreage coming into production  to costs no longer being capitalized  and fewer costs being inventoried that are related to the crop year 
for a further discussion of the farming year refer to part i  item i business farming operations 
interest 
interest and investment income for increased  to  when compared to interest income 
the receipt of funds associated with the rights offering  which was completed during january  primarily drove the increase 
the increase in income from additional funds invested was partially offset by lower interest rates during the year 
interest income for was  or  less than interest income 
income remained stable due to the average funds being invested remaining fairly flat when compared to interest expense for was  of which  is included in discontinued operations  compared to interest expense of  in  of which  is included in discontinued operations 
the decrease in interest expense is due to liquidation of debt throughout the year 
debt declined due to the disposal of our livestock operations throughout the year and to using cash from the rights offering to reduce debt 
interest incurred and paid in was  compared to  in  of which  and  were capitalized  respectively 
interest capitalized increased during due to the growth in our real estate development activities 
interest expense during was  compared to  during of this  of expense in   was included in discontinued operations 
this growth in interest expense was due to an increase in borrowings related to livestock operations and real estate entitlement and infrastructure costs 
total interest incurred and paid in was  compared to  in  of which  and  were capitalized  respectively 
interest incurred and expensed continued to grow during due to increased borrowing used to fund the growth of livestock operations  infrastructure development costs  the purchase of an almond processing plant  and real estate planning and entitlement activities 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses in were  an increase of  when compared to corporate expenses 
the increase during is due to higher professional service fees related to accounting and legal costs  higher staffing costs related to deferred stock compensation costs and employee benefits  and to higher depreciation expense 
corporate expenses during were  a decline of  when compared to corporate expenses 
when compared to  reductions in insurance  director s fees and shareholder expenses were partially offset by increased staffing costs 
staffing costs increased primarily due to deferred stock compensation costs and to management information systems mis personnel being hired for all of compared to a partial year in discontinued operations 
during april  we finalized a plan for the sale of our cattle and feedlot division 
since then  we have been disposing of our cattle and feedlot operations to provide capital for real estate development activities and to reduce outstanding debt of the company 
while the sale of livestock assets has provided working capital  it will also result in the loss of significant revenues even after taking into account the revenue stream from the grazing leases we entered into in connection with the sale of the breeding herd 
over the last three years the livestock division accounted for to of our total revenues 
while the operations of the livestock division created significant revenues they also used large amounts of debt and working capital 
we believe our working capital and debt facilities would be better allocated to potentially higher returning and value enhancing real estate development activities  which led to our decision to dispose of the livestock division assets 
the process of selling a major portion of our breeding herd was completed in june  and the sale of the feedlot was completed during july during june  we sold our remaining breeding herd for million to centennial livestock  a california agricultural company 
the transaction with centennial livestock also included a grazing lease for approximately  acres 
this lease has a term of up to ten years and provides for rent at the rate of  per year and is subject to adjustment based upon rainfall and the extent to which we exercise our right to use portions of the land for other purposes 
in july we completed the sale of our feedlot in texas for million 
the combined gain on sale  net of applicable income taxes  was we started with approximately  head of cattle and ended the year with  head of cattle 
these remaining head of stocker cattle are expected to be sold by the end of april we also expect that these cattle will be sold for at least their current book value 
income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of  during was  less than the  of income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  in the decline in income is largely due to revenues from discontinued operations of  decreasing  when compared to the  of revenues for this reduction in revenues is primarily due to fewer cattle being sold when compared to and to lower prices on cattle during the fourth quarter of during  approximately  fewer head of cattle were sold 
this reduction in cattle sold is due to replacement cattle not being purchased throughout the year that possibly could have been sold because of the decision to dispose of our livestock and feedlot assets 
partially offsetting this decline in revenues was a corresponding decline in expense due to fewer cattle being sold and to cattle inventory numbers declining throughout the year 
these changes partially offset the gain described above 
during  we continued to use the futures and options markets to protect the future selling prices of cattle and purchase prices of feed 
during  due to an improvement in prices during the first half of the year  we recognized approximately  in losses on closed hedge positions 
our goal in managing cattle and feed costs is to protect or create a range of selling prices and feed prices that allow us to recognize a profit or minimize a loss on the sale of cattle once all costs are deducted 
the risk in managing cattle prices is that in those years that prices increase the hedge may limit or cap potential gains from the increase in price  and the risk in managing feed costs is that it can add additional costs for feed if grain prices fall dramatically 
at year end we had no futures or options contracts outstanding 
cattle prices strengthened during the first half of due to improved demand for beef products 
the increase in prices and demand faded during the fourth quarter of the year 
thus far in prices have improved during february and march due to demand for beef products improving and inventories being lower 
income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of  in was a  increase when compared to income from discontinued operations  net of taxes 
the improvement in profits was primarily due to an increase in cattle sales of  and increased feedlot revenue of  cattle sales grew due to  additional head of cattle being sold at higher average prices than in feedlot revenues increased due to an increase in the average occupancy rate of outside customers during these improvements in revenues were partially offset by higher cost of sales on cattle sold of approximately  due to more cattle being sold and increases in feed cost of approximately  at the feedlot and due to year end drought conditions on the ranch 
on december  we sold a portion of our cattle assets to echeverria cattle company  llc  which is owned by matthew j 
echeverria  our former senior vice president  livestock and ranch operations 
the transaction involved the sale of approximately  cows  bulls and certain personal property for a purchase price of  as well as a grazing lease over approximately  acres of our land 
the lease has a term of ten years with two five year options to extend the term and provides for rent at the rate of  per year  subject to adjustment based upon rainfall and the extent to which we exercise our right to use portions of the land for other purposes 
the rent would also be subject to adjustment for the two five year extension periods based upon changes in the price of calves between the date the lease commences and the date any such extension term commences 
the sale involved approximately of our breeding herd and approximately of the total amount of our cattle 
in a separate transaction we also sold an additional  head of stocker cattle to echeverria cattle company in the normal course of our sales of stocker cattle

inflation  risks  and related factors affecting forward looking information 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
our strategy  focused on more aggressive development of our land  involves risk and could  at times  result in operating losses 
cyclical industry 
the real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  including 
employment levels 
availability of financing 
interest rates 
consumer confidence 
demand for the developed product  whether residential or industrial the process of development of a project begins  and financial and other resources are committed  long before a real estate project comes to market  which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed 
it is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected 
interest rates 
higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing  and that can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential  commercial or industrial sites 
any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments 
any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development  which would negatively impact the demand for land in our development process 
government regulation 
in planning and developing our land  we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  infrastructure design  and construction guidelines 
these requirements can possibly include restrictive zoning and density provisions that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area  which may impact the financial returns from a given project 
in addition  we are subject to statutes and regulations concerning the protection of the environment 
environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site s location  condition  present and former uses of the site  and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species 
environmental laws and conditions may result in delays and or cause us to incur additional costs for compliance  mitigation and processing land use applications 
in addition  many states  cities and counties have in the past approved various slow growth measures 
if that were to occur in our region  our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected 
litigation 
the land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of third party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation would  by their nature  adversely affect the length of time required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and could adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
real estate inventory risk 
our three principal real estate projects  the tejon industrial complex  centennial and the tejon mountain village concept  all involve obtaining governmental entitlements and improving lots for sale to developers or  in the case of tejon industrial complex  end users 
the value of these lots can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and market conditions 
competition 
within our real estate activities  we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in northern  central  and southern california 
we are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using interstate and state route for commercial leasing opportunities 
geographic concentration 
all of our developable land is in california 
any adverse change in the economic climate of california  or our region of that state  could adversely affect our real estate development activities 
ultimately our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions 
financing 
our proposed new real estate development will require additional financing 
it is uncertain whether the required financing will be available  and if so  whether it will be available on favorable terms 
inflation 
inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue  just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
within our real estate operations  our lease portfolio is protected to some extent from inflation since percentage rent clauses and consumer price index increases in our leases tend to adjust rental receipts for inflation 
other risks 
we may also encounter other difficulties in developing our land  including 
natural risks  such as geological and soils problems  earthquakes  heavy rains and flooding and heavy winds  
shortages of qualified tradespeople  
reliance on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized  
shortages of materials  and 
increases in the cost of certain materials 
new accounting pronouncements 
financial accounting standards board statement fasb no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was approved and issued in june and addresses amortization on intangible assets 
statement supercedes apb opinion no 
 which required amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
the presumption that goodwill and intangible assets were wasting assets and should be amortized over a period of not more than years has been altered  and now such assets are deemed to have an indefinite life and are no longer amortized 
the value of the intangible assets must be assessed annually for impairment 
this statement will have a minimal impact on our financial position or results of operations as the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets are insignificant 
the statement will be adopted for the financial year 
in june fasb statement no 
was issued addressing accounting for asset retirement obligations aros 
this statement covers obligations that a company incurs for the retirement of tangible long lived assets such as drilling rigs or manufacturing plants 
we do not anticipate this pronouncement having a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations when it becomes effective for the financial year 
fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  was issued in august the pronouncement issues guidance on distinguishing between assets held and used  held for sale  and held for disposal other than sale 
it also addresses the classification and valuation of such assets 
the pronouncement is effective for the fiscal year 
we do not anticipate this pronouncement having a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
fasb statement no 
 business combinations  eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations 
this statement is not anticipated to have an effect on our financial position or results of operations 
financial condition 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled approximately  at december   an increase of  from the corresponding amount at the end of working capital at the end of was  which is  greater than working capital at the end of we have a revolving line of credit of  that  as of december   had no outstanding balance 
this line of credit bears interest at a rate which floats with changes in the lending bank s prime interest rate 
at our option the interest rate on this line of credit can be fixed for a period of time at over a selected libor rate or float at 
less than the bank s prime lending rate 
during short term debt was reduced due to the disposition of livestock assets and to the use of proceeds from the rights offering that was completed earlier in in past years  the use of short term credit grew due to increases in inventories as a result of the growth of our business lines and to the funding of infrastructure construction costs on a short term basis 
our outstanding long term debt  less current portion of  declined  to  at the end of when compared to long term debt is being used to fund real estate development infrastructure and farming assets on our land  commercial buildings in phoenix  arizona that were purchased in  and the almond processing plant purchased in january long term debt currently consists of three separate debt obligations 
one long term note for real estate and farming purposes provides for loan amounts up to  has a current balance of  and is secured by farmland 
this note comes due in the second note obligation was used to purchase the buildings in phoenix  is secured by mortgages on the buildings  and has a balance of  the last note is for a loan used to purchase the almond processing plant in and has a balance of  the following table shows our long term obligations and commitments over the next five years payments due by period one year after total or less years years years contractual obligations long term debt      total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period one year after total or less years years years other commercial commitments standby letter of credit   guarantees   total commercial commitments   the standby letter of credit is related to the issuance of community facility district bonds by the tejon ranch public facilities financing authority  a joint powers authority created by kern county and the tejon castac water district 
the standby letter of credit is in place to provide additional credit enhancement and covers approximately two years worth of interest on the outstanding bonds 
this letter of credit will not be drawn upon unless we  as the largest landowner in the district  fail to make our property tax payments 
this letter of credit will terminate in the future as land in the district becomes developed 
the guarantees consist of a  guarantee related to the debt of petro travel plaza llc  an unconsolidated limited liability company in which we are equity owners with petro stopping centers  lp total debt in the venture is approximately  and is related to the construction of the facility 
during this note is scheduled to be refinanced with a permanent mortgage loan  and our guarantee will no longer be needed 
the remaining  of guarantees relate to debt within the tejon dermody industrial llc  an unconsolidated joint venture to construct and market a  square foot building at the tejon industrial complex 
total debt in the venture is approximately  and was used in the construction of the building 
in the joint venture agreement each partner agreed to guarantee one half of the outstanding construction loan debt through the two year term of the loan 
during march  a lease was signed for one half of the building and the lease payments from this lease will cover future debt service requirements under the current loan agreement 
at this time we believe that neither of the guarantees nor the standby letter of credit will ever be called upon 
during the principal uses of cash and cash equivalents consisted of capital expenditures related to real estate development activities  financing of receivables and inventories  and the reduction in both short term and long term debt 
the principal uses of cash and cash equivalents during and consisted of capital expenditures  expansion of the cattle herd  purchase of land  purchases of commercial buildings  purchase of an almond processing plant  payments of long term debt  the payment of dividends and the financing of higher receivables and inventories 
the accurate forecasting of cash flows is made difficult due to the fact that commodity markets set the prices for the majority of our farming products and the fact that the cost of water changes significantly from year to year as a result of changes in its availability 
based on our past experience  we believe we will have adequate cash flows over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
during   has been budgeted for capital expenditures  which includes nearly  for infrastructure at the tejon industrial complex and  for real estate projects in the mountain lake area of our lands and los angeles county 
other items included in the capital expenditure budget are equipment and improvements to existing facilities 
one of the sources of funding capital expenditures and debt repayment during was proceeds from the million rights offering that was completed on january  in addition to these funds  proceeds were received throughout the year related to the disposition of our livestock operations 
proceeds from the rights offering are going to be used to further develop the tejon industrial complex and for costs related to constraints and feasibility analyses  early phase and detailed planning  and preparing applications for entitlements in the mountain lake area of our land 
during  additional funds for capital expenditures and operations are expected to come from lines of credit with banks  further use of the proceeds from the rights offering  reimbursement of infrastructure costs related to the tejon industrial complex through bond proceeds from a local government agency  proceeds from discontinued operations  and from operating cash flows 
we continue to expect that substantial investments will need to be made in future years in our land assets to secure entitlements and develop the land 
in order to fund this growth  we expect to use various financing alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners  increases in lines of credit with banks  sales of assets  and the issuance of common stock 
we cannot provide any assurances that these sources of financing will be available 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices 
financial market risks the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes to interest rates and credit risks related to marketable securities  interest rates related to its own outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and prudently manage risk while at the same time maximizing yields 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure  we limit our investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years with an investment grade of a or better from moody s or standard and poors 
see note  marketable securities  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its short term working capital line of credit and the long term debt currently outstanding 
the short term line of credit interest rate can be tied to the lending bank s prime rate and would change when that rate changes  or the debt can be tied to a libor rate on a fixed basis and change only at maturity of the fixed rate feature 
a portion of the long term debt  has a fixed interest rate  and the fair value of this long term debt will change based on interest rate movements in the market 
the remaining long term debt  can either be fixed for periods of time to a libor rate or float with the lending bank s prime rate 
the floating rate obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense also decreases 
we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
it is our objective to hedge between and of the variable rate interest payments 
to meet this objective we entered into an interest rate swap to manage the potential fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk 
see note  interest rate risk management  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
market risks related to our inventories ultimately depend on the value of the cattle  almonds  grapes  pistachios  and walnuts at the time of payment or sale 
credit risk related to our receivables depends upon the financial condition of our customers 
based on historical experience with current customers and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  we believe our credit risk is minimal 
market risk is discussed below in commodity price exposure 
the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

in comparison to the prior year our risk in regard to fluctuations in interest rates has decreased due to the reduction in the use of both short term and long term lines of credit that fluctuate with the bank s prime lending rate 
commodity price exposure we have exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories  gross margins  accounts receivable  and certain anticipated transactions in our discontinued operations and farming division 
commodities such as corn and cattle are purchased and sold at market prices that are subject to volatility 
in order to manage the risk of market price fluctuations  we enter into various exchange traded futures and option contracts 
we closely monitor and manage our exposure to market price risk on a daily basis in accordance with formal policies established for this activity 
these policies limit the duration to maturity of contracts entered into as well as the level of exposure to be hedged 
our goal in managing our cattle and feed costs has been to protect or create a range of selling prices and feed prices that allow us to recognize a profit or minimize a loss on the sale of cattle once all costs are deducted 
see note  commodity contracts used to manage risk  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a futures contract is an obligation to make or take delivery at a specific future time of a specifically defined  standardized unit of a commodity at a price determined when the contract is executed 
options are contracts that give their owners the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell a specified item at a set price on or before a specified date 
losses on futures contracts and options as of december  were  as compared to the approximately  in losses at december  the decrease in hedge losses is primarily due to a decrease in the number of cattle owned and a drop in prices during the fourth quarter of these losses are recorded in discontinued operations 
since we had only  head of cattle remaining at december   we do not intend to enter into any futures or option contracts in the future 
inventories consist of almonds related to the crop and farming costs related to crop production 
within our discontinued operations  inventory consists of cattle for sale  and price fluctuations historically were managed with futures and options contracts 
the almond inventory is recorded at per pound  which is the current price of almonds 
the farming costs inventoried that are related to the crop are recorded at actual costs incurred 
historically  these costs have been recovered each year when that year s crop harvest has been sold 
the table below shows futures and option contracts outstanding at year end  there were no contracts outstanding at december  we are at risk with respect to changes in market prices with respect to cattle held for sale that are not protected by futures and options contracts 
at december  approximately of the cattle held in inventory  or  head of cattle  were not protected by futures and options for price movement 
this compares to  head of cattle at december  the number of head of cattle equates to approximately million pounds of beef 
for each 
per pound change in price  we have a potential exposure of  in future value
