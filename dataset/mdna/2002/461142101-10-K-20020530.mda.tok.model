in an effort to improve its sales and marketing operations  the company hired experienced sales personnel during fiscal and intends to add additional sales personnel during fiscal as the company has broadened its product and service offerings and expanded its reach globally  management has recognized the need to establish managerial processes appropriate for the size and complexity of its global sales organization 
the company is currently implementing an oracle based crm customer management tool that will provide management and its sales force with necessary data to allow the company to better build  track  manage and forecast its active global sales backlog and pipeline 
management believes that the information conveyed by the oracle system will provide management and its sales force the information necessary to effectively direct the company s complex global sales organization and will result in increased sales force productivity  enhanced strategy formulation through greater insight into market demand and trends  and increased visibility into the company s sales pipeline and backlog 
strategic alliances the company actively seeks strategic relationships with companies that enhance the company s technological strength  improve its market position  facilitate shorter time to market  enhance its ability to deliver end to end solutions  and broaden its market coverage 
the company currently has relationships with several technology leaders  including nuance  philips and speechworks for speech technologies  solutions for wireless internet and proactive alerts technologies and general magic for voicexml and java based jee development tools and deployment software 
the company also has strategic relationships with major telecommunications equipment suppliers to distribute its nsd systems worldwide and with over distributors and value added resellers worldwide to distribute esd systems 
backlog the company s systems backlog at february  and and february  was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the company expects all existing backlog to be delivered within fiscal due to customer demand  many of the company s sales are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
thus  the company s backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of actual sales for any future period 
research and development research and development expenses were approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
such expenses were approximately million during fiscal and included a million charge for in process research and development incurred in connection with the company s merger with brite voice systems  inc brite 
see in process research and development below under item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net of this charge  research and development expenses were approximately million during fiscal such recurring expenses during fiscal  and included the design of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the company expects to maintain its strong commitment to research and development to remain at the forefront of technology development in its business segments  which is essential to the continued improvement of the company s position in the industry 
proprietary rights the company believes that its existing patent  copyright  license and other proprietary rights in its products and technologies are material to the conduct of its business 
to protect these proprietary rights  the company relies on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright and other proprietary rights laws  nondisclosure safeguards and license agreements 
as of february   the company owned patents in the united states and in certain foreign countries 
in addition  the company has registered intervoice as a trademark in the united states and in certain foreign countries and has a pending registration for intervoice brite 
currently  the company also has registered marks and pending applications for various product and service names worldwide  of which  marks are registered and marks are pending in the united states 
the company s software and other products are generally licensed to customers pursuant to a nontransferable license agreement that restricts the use of the software and other products to the customer s internal purposes 
although the company s license agreements prohibit a customer from disclosing proprietary information contained in the company s products to any other person  it is technologically possible for competitors of the company to copy aspects of the company s products in violation of the company s rights 
furthermore  even in cases where patents are granted  the detection and policing of the unauthorized use of the patented technology is difficult 
moreover  judicial enforcement of copyrights may be uncertain  particularly in foreign countries 
the occurrence of the unauthorized use of the company s proprietary information by the company s competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
from time to time various owners of patents and copyrighted works send the company letters alleging that its products do or might infringe upon the owners intellectual property rights  and or suggesting that the company should negotiate a license or cross license agreement with the owner 
the company s policy is to never knowingly infringe upon any third party s intellectual property rights 
accordingly  the company forwards any such allegation or licensing request to its outside legal counsel for their review and opinion 
the company generally attempts to resolve any such matter by informing the owner of its position concerning non infringement or invalidity  and or  if appropriate  negotiating a license or cross license agreement 
even though the company attempts to resolve these matters without litigation  it is always possible that the owner of the patent or copyrighted works will institute litigation 
owners of patent s and or copyrighted work s have previously instituted litigation against the company alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights  although no such litigation is currently pending against the company 
as noted above  the company currently has a portfolio of patents  and it has applied for and will continue to apply for and receive a number of additional patents to reflect its technological innovations 
the company believes that its patent portfolio could allow it to assert counterclaims for infringement against certain owners of intellectual property rights if those owners were to sue the company for infringement 
in certain situations  it might be beneficial for the company to cross license certain of its patents for other patents which are relevant to the call automation industry 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of certain patent matters 
the company believes that software and technology companies  including the company and others in the company s industry  increasingly may become subject to infringement claims 
such claims may require the company to enter into costly license agreements  or result in even more costly litigation 
to the extent the company requires a licensing arrangement  the arrangement may not be available at all  or  if available  may be very expensive or even prohibitively expensive 
as with any legal proceeding  there is no guarantee that the company will prevail in any litigation instituted against the company asserting infringement of intellectual property rights 
to the extent the company suffers an adverse judgment  it might have to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  repurchase infringing products from the company s customers pursuant to indemnity obligations  expend significant resources to acquire non infringing alternatives  and or obtain licenses to the intellectual property that has been infringed upon 
as with licensing arrangements  non infringing substitute technologies may not be available  and if available  may be very expensive  or even prohibitively expensive  to implement 
accordingly  for all of the foregoing reasons  a claim of infringement could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing and facilities the company s manufacturing operations consist primarily of the final assembly  integration and extensive testing and quality control of subassemblies  host computer platforms  operating software and the company s run time software 
the company currently uses third parties to perform printed circuit board assembly  sheet metal fabrication and customer site service and repair 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products  some of its components  including semi conductors and  in particular  digital signal processors manufactured by texas instruments and at t corp  are available only from a small number of vendors 
likewise  the company licenses speech recognition technology from a small number of vendors 
to date  the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of needed components and licenses in a timely manner 
if the company s significant vendors are unable or cease to supply components or licenses at current levels  the company may not be able to obtain these items from another source 
consequently  the company would be unable to provide products and to service its customers  which would negatively impact its business and operating results

katz technology licensing lp raktl has sent letters to certain customers of the company suggesting that the customer should negotiate a license agreement to cover the practice of certain patents owned by raktl 
in the letters  raktl has alleged that certain of its patents pertain to certain enhanced services offered by network providers  including prepaid card and wireless services and postpaid card services 
raktl has further alleged that certain of its patents pertain to certain call processing applications  including applications for call centers that route calls using a called party s dnis identification number 
certain products offered by the company can be programmed and configured to provide enhanced services to network providers and call processing applications for call centers 
the company s contracts with customers usually include a qualified obligation to indemnify and defend customers against claims that products as delivered by the company infringe a third party s patent 
none of the company s customers have notified the company that raktl has claimed that any product provided by the company infringes any claims of any raktl patent 
accordingly  the company has not been required to defend any customers against a claim of infringement under a raktl patent 
the company has  however  received letters from customers notifying the company of the efforts by raktl to license its patent portfolio and reminding the company of its potential obligations under the indemnification provisions of the applicable agreements in the event that a claim is asserted 
in response to correspondence from raktl  a few customers have attempted to tender to the company the defense of its products under contractual indemnity provisions 
the company has informed these customers that while it fully intends to honor any contractual indemnity provisions  it does not believe it currently has any obligation to provide such a defense because raktl does not appear to have made a claim that a company product infringes a patent

verizon communications inc  et al  no 
cv  pending in us district court  eastern district of pennsylvania  raktl has alleged that verizon communications  inc verizon and certain of its affiliates infringe patents held by raktl 
from until november of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  brite  provided prepaid services to an affiliate of verizon under a managed services contract 
the affiliate  which is named as a defendant in the lawsuit  recently notified brite of the pendency of the lawsuit and referenced provisions of the managed services contract which require brite to indemnify the affiliate against claims that its services infringe a patent 
the claims in the lawsuit make general references to prepaid services and a variety of other services offered by verizon and the affiliate but do not refer to brite s products or services 
the company has informed the affiliate that it can find no basis for an indemnity obligation under the expired contract 
even though raktl has not alleged that a product provided by the company infringes a raktl patent  it is always possible that raktl may do so 
in the event that a company product becomes the subject of litigation  a customer could attempt to invoke the company s indemnity obligations under the applicable agreement 
as with most sales contracts with suppliers of computerized equipment  the company s contractual indemnity obligations are generally limited to the products and services provided by the company  and generally require the customer to allow the company to have sole control over any litigation and settlement negotiations with the patent holder 
the customers who have received letters from raktl generally have multiple suppliers of the types of products that might potentially be subject to claims by raktl 
even though no claims have been made that a specific product offered by the company infringes any claim under the raktl patent portfolio  the company has received opinions from its outside patent counsel that certain products and applications offered by the company do not infringe certain claims of the raktl patents 
the company has also received opinions from its outside counsel that certain claims under the raktl patent portfolio are invalid 
furthermore  based on the reviews by outside counsel  the company is not aware of any claims under the raktl portfolio that are infringed by the company s products 
if the company does become involved in litigation in connection with the raktl patent portfolio  under a contractual indemnity or any other legal theory  the company intends to vigorously contest the claims and to assert appropriate defenses 
a number of companies  including some large  well known companies and some customers of the company  have already licensed certain rights under the raktl patent portfolio 
during november  raktl announced license agreements with  among others  at t corp  microsoft corporation and international business machines corporation

as a result of the mediation effort  sprint has requested that the company provide a defense and indemnification to aerotel s infringement claims  to the extent that they pertain to any wireless prepaid services offered by the company 
in response to this request  the company has offered to assist sprint s counsel in defending against such claims  to the extent they deal with issues unique to the system and services provided by the company  and to reimburse sprint for the reasonable attorneys fees associated therewith 
the trial court has stayed the lawsuit pending certain rulings from the united states patent and trademark office 
the company has received opinions from its outside patent counsel that the wireless prepaid services offered by the company do not infringe the patent 
if the company does become involved in litigation in connection with the patent  under a contractual indemnity or any other legal theory  the company intends to vigorously contest any claims that its prepaid wireless services infringe the patent and to assert appropriate defenses

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosures regarding forward looking statements this report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  including  without limitation  statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under business and notes to consolidated financial statements located elsewhere herein regarding the company s financial position  business strategy  plans and objectives of management of the company for future operations and industry conditions  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  the following significant factors  among others  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause such results during fiscal  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company the company s issuance of convertible notes and warrants could substantially dilute the interests of the existing shareholders 
the million in convertible notes issued by the company in may are convertible by the holders into common stock at any time prior to their maturity in june at an initial conversion price of of the weighted average price of the company s common stock on the date of issuance 
moreover  the conversion price of the convertible notes could be lowered  perhaps substantially  in a variety of circumstances  including the company s issuance of common stock below the holders conversion price either directly or in connection with the issuance of most securities convertible into  or exercisable for  common stock  the company s failure to comply with specific registration and listing obligations applicable to the common stock into which the convertible notes are convertible  and other breaches by the company of its obligations to the note holders 
correspondingly  the company issued to the note holders in may three year warrants entitling the warrant holders to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
both the number of warrants and the exercise price are subject to adjustments that could make them further dilutive to existing shareholders 
neither the notes nor the warrants establishes a floor limiting reductions in  respectively  the conversion price of the convertible notes or the exercise price of the warrants that may occur under certain circumstances 
correspondingly  there is no ceiling on the number of warrants that may be issuable under certain circumstances under the antidilution adjustments in the warrants 
the company is required to pay its outstanding loans under the credit facility before any installment of principal on the convertible notes is paid in cash and therefore the required payments in stock could be dilutive to the company s shareholders and such dilution could be made worse by the note and warrantholders hedging activities 
the company s revolving credit facility prohibits the company from paying any installments on the convertible notes in cash at any time the company has indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility 
under such circumstances the company will effectively be required to pay installments on the convertible notes through a partial conversion of the convertible notes into common stock 
the conversion price  subject to certain anti dilution adjustments  would be the lower of i of the weighted average trading price for the company s common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market on the issuance date or ii of the average of the weighted average trading prices of the company s common stock during the time period to which the installment relates 
since the company s inability to pay installments in cash would most likely occur when it is experiencing unsatisfactory operating results and lower trading prices for its common stock  the number of shares required to pay an installment in a partial conversion of the convertible notes could increase significantly  with the resultant dilution further depressing the company s stock price 
moreover  the note and warrant holders may hedge their positions in the company s stock through shorting the company s stock  which could further adversely affect the stock price 
this hedging activity and its effect on the stock price could increase the number of shares required to be issued on the next installment date 
any failure by the company to satisfy its registration  listing and other obligations with respect to the common stock underlying the convertible notes and the warrants could result in adverse consequences  including acceleration of the convertible notes 
the company is required to file a registration statement covering the common stock underlying the convertible notes and the warrants by june  and cause it to become effective by september  and  subject to certain exceptions  maintain its effectiveness until the underlying common stock is no longer restricted for federal securities law purposes 
the company is subject to various penalties for failure to meet its registration obligations and the related stock exchange listing for the underlying common stock  including cash penalties and forced redemption of the convertible notes at the greater of i of the principal amount plus interest or ii the product of the conversion rate the amount of principal and interest being redeemed divided by the conversion price multiplied by the weighted average price of the company s common stock on the trading day immediately preceding its registration or listing default 
if the company is unable to issue common stock under the convertible notes because the amount issuable would exceed the number of shares that the company is permitted to issue without shareholder approval under nasdaq national market requirements aggregate shares in excess of of the issued and outstanding shares  then the company may be required to redeem the convertible notes at of the principal plus accrued interest at 
the company is obligated to make significant periodic payments of principal and interest under its financing instruments 
the company has material indebtedness outstanding under the above discussed i credit facility  ii mortgage loan secured by the company s office facilities in dallas  texas  and iii convertible notes 
the company is required to make periodic payments of interest on each of the financial instruments and  in the case of the convertible notes  periodic payments of principal 
the company is not in default under any of the financing instruments and believes it will have the resources to make all required principal and interest payments 
if  however  the company at any time does default on any of its payment obligations or other obligations under any financing instrument  the creditors under the applicable instrument will have all rights available under the instrument  including acceleration  termination and  with respect to the secured financings  enforcement of security interests 
the financing instruments also have certain qualified cross default provisions  particularly for acceleration of indebtedness under one of the other instruments 
under such circumstances  the company s cash position and liquidity would be severally impacted  and it is possible the company would not be able to pay its debts as they come due 
the company has experienced recent operating losses and may not operate profitably in the future 
the company incurred net losses of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company may continue to incur operating losses  which could hinder the company s ability to operate its current business 
the company cannot provide assurances that it will be able to generate sufficient revenues from its operations to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
general business activity has declined 
the company s sales are largely dependant on the strength of the domestic and international economies and  in particular  on demand for telecommunications equipment  computers  software and other technology products 
the market for telecommunications equipment has declined sharply  and the markets for computers  software and other technology products also have declined 
in addition  there is an increased concern that demand for the types of products offered by the company will further soften as a result of domestic and global economic and political conditions following the attacks by terrorists on september in recent quarters  the company has fallen short of its sales and earnings expectations 
many of the company s transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the size and timing of some transactions have historically caused sales fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
while in the past the impact of these fluctuations was mitigated to some extent by the geographic and vertical market diversification of the company s existing and prospective customers  the company has become increasingly prone to quarterly sales fluctuations because of its sales to the enhanced telecommunications services systems market 
the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any quarter can cause wide variations in the company s quarterly sales and earnings  as such sales are unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
the company s accuracy in estimating future sales is largely dependant on its ability to successfully qualify  estimate and close system sales during a quarter 
see the discussion entitled sales in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the company s pipeline of system sales opportunities 
the company s systems sales and  as a result  its total sales during recent quarters have fallen short of guidance publicly provided by the company 
as a result  the company did not provide sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter of fiscal the company is subject to potential and pending lawsuits and other claims 
the company is subject to certain potential and pending lawsuits and other claims discussed in item legal proceedings 
the company believes that each of the potential and pending lawsuits and other claims to which it is subject is without merit and intends to defend each matter vigorously 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company will prevail in any or all of the litigation or other matters 
an adverse judgment in any of these matters  as well as the company s expenses relating to its defense of a given matter  could have consequences materially adverse to the company 
the company faces intense competition based on product capabilities and experiences ever increasing demands from its actual and prospective customers for its products to be compatible with a variety of rapidly proliferating computing  telephony and computer networking technologies and standards 
the ultimate success of the company s products is dependent  to a large degree  on the company allocating its resources to developing and improving products compatible with those technologies  standards and functionalities that ultimately become widely accepted by the company s actual and prospective customers 
the company s success is also dependent  to a large degree  on the company s ability to implement arrangements with other vendors with complementary product offerings to provide actual and prospective customers greater functionality and to ensure that the company s products are compatible with the increased variety of technologies and standards 
the principal competitors for the company s esd systems are avaya  ibm and nortel networks  the principal competitors for the company s nsd systems are comverse technology  ericsson  lucent technologies and unisys 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  technological and marketing resources than the company has 
although the company has committed substantial resources to enhance its existing products and to develop and market new products  there is no assurance it will be successful 
the company may not be able to retain its customer base and  in particular  its more significant customers  such as british telecom 
the company s success depends substantially on retaining its significant customers 
the loss of one of the company s significant customers could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
the company s installed base of customers generally is not contractually obligated to place further systems orders with the company or to extend their services contracts with the company at the expiration of their current contracts 
moreover  the company has phased out a number of brite products and has attempted to migrate brite customers over to the company s own functionally similar products  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain brite s customer base 
sales to british telecom  which purchases both systems and managed services from the company  accounted for approximately  and of the company s total sales during fiscal  and  respectively 
under the terms of its managed services contract with bt cellnet and at current exchange rates  the company will recognize revenues of million per month through july  down from a fiscal high of approximately million per month 
the amounts received under the agreement may vary based on future changes in the exchange rate between the dollar and the british pound 
the company s reliance on significant vendor relationships could result in significant expense or inability to serve its customers if it loses these relationships 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products  some of its components  including semi conductors and  in particular  digital signal processors manufactured by texas instruments and at t corp  are available only from a small number of vendors 
likewise  the company licenses speech recognition technology from a small number of vendors 
to date  the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of needed components and licenses in a timely manner 
if the company s significant vendors are unable or cease to supply components or licenses at current levels  the company may not be able to obtain these items from another source 
consequently  the company would be unable to provide products and to service its customers  which would negatively impact its business and operating results 
the company s inability to protect its intellectual property against infringement and infringement claims could negatively impact its business 
the company s protection of its patent  copyright  trademarks and other proprietary rights in its products and technologies is critical to the continued success of its business 
although the company s proprietary rights are protected by a combination of intellectual property laws  nondisclosure safeguards and license agreements  it is technologically possible for the company s competitors to copy aspects of the company s products in violation of these protected rights 
moreover  it may be possible for competitors to provide products and technologies competitive to those of the company without violating the company s protected rights 
even in cases where patents protect aspects of the company s technology  the detection and policing of the unauthorized use of the patented technology is difficult 
further  judicial enforcement of patents  trademarks and copyrights may be uncertain  particularly in foreign countries 
unauthorized use of the company s proprietary technology by its competitors could negatively impact its business  operating results and financial condition 
if third parties assert claims that the company s products or services infringe on their technology and related intellectual property rights  whether the claims are made directly against the company or against the company s customers  the company could incur substantial costs to defend these claims 
if any of these claims is ultimately successful  a third party could require the company to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to acquire non infringing alternatives  and or obtain licenses to use the infringed intellectual property rights 
moreover  where the claims are asserted with respect to the company s customers  additional expenses may be involved in indemnifying the customer and or designing and providing non infringing products 
see disclosures regarding forward looking statements the company is subject to potential and pending lawsuits and other claims and item business proprietary rights 
the company is exposed to risks related to its international operations that could increase its costs and hurt its business 
the company s products are currently sold in countries 
the company s international sales  as a percentage of total company sales  were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal international sales are subject to certain risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the difficulty and expense of maintaining foreign offices and distribution channels  tariffs and other barriers to trade  greater difficulty in protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights  general economic conditions in each country  loss of revenue  property and equipment from expropriation  import and export licensing requirements  and additional expenses and risks inherent in conducting operations in geographically distant locations  including risks arising from customers speaking different languages and having different cultural approaches to the conduct of business 
the company s inability to properly estimate costs under fixed price contracts could negatively impact its profitability 
some of the company s contracts to develop application software and customize systems provide for the customer to pay a fixed price for its products and services regardless of whether the company s costs to perform under the contract exceed the amount of the fixed price 
if the company is unable to estimate accurately the amount of future costs under these fixed price contracts  or if unforeseen additional costs must be incurred to perform under these contracts  the company s ability to operate profitably under these contracts will be adversely affected 
many of the company s contracts  particularly for managed services  foreign contracts and contracts with telecommunication companies  include provisions for the assessment of liquidated damages for delayed performance by the company 
since the company s projects frequently require a significant degree of customization  it is difficult for the company to predict when it will complete such projects 
accordingly  the company has had to pay liquidated damages in the past and may have to pay additional liquidated damages in the future 
any such future liquidated damages could be significant 
increasing consolidation in the telecommunications and financial industries could affect the company s revenues and profitability 
several of the company s significant customers are in the telecommunications and financial industries  which are undergoing increasing consolidation as a result of merger and acquisition activity 
this activity involving the company s significant customers could decrease the number of customers purchasing the company s products and or delay purchases of the company s products by customers that are in the process of reviewing their strategic alternatives in light of a pending merger or acquisition 
if the company has fewer customers or its customers delay purchases of the company s products as a result of merger and acquisition activity  the company s revenues and profitability could decline 
government action and  in particular  action with respect to the telecommunications act of regulating the telecommunications industry could have a negative impact on the company s business 
future growth in the markets for the company s products will depend in part on privatization and deregulation of certain telecommunication markets worldwide 
any reversal or slowdown in the pace of this privatization or deregulation could negatively impact the markets for the company s products 
moreover  the consequences of deregulation are subject to many uncertainties  including judicial and administrative proceedings that affect the pace at which the changes contemplated by deregulation occur  and other regulatory  economic and political factors 
any invalidation  repeal or modification of the requirements imposed by the telecommunications act of could negatively impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the uncertainties associated with deregulation could cause the company s customers to delay purchasing decisions pending the resolution of such uncertainties 
significant market fluctuations could affect the price of the company s common stock 
extreme price and volume trading volatility in the us stock market has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many high technology companies  frequently for reasons other than the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
results of operations the following table presents certain items as a percentage of sales for the company s last three fiscal years

accounting policies in preparing its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the company uses statistical analyses  estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results 
the company considers the following three accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on the company s financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware and software systems  from the delivery of maintenance and other customer services associated with installed systems and from the provision of its network solutions and enterprise solutions applications on an asp managed service basis 
effective march   the company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
for systems that do not require customization to be performed by the company  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when the related hardware and software are delivered and any installation or other post delivery obligation has been fulfilled  when the fee is fixed or determinable and when collection is probable 
in prior years  although the company s contracts often included installation and customer acceptance provisions  revenue generally was recognized at the time of shipment based on the company s belief that no significant uncertainties about customer acceptance existed 
for systems that require significant customization and where the completed contract method of accounting is applicable  the company recognizes revenue upon customer acceptance 
prior to the implementation of sab  the company recognized revenue on these systems upon completion of installation and testing but prior to customer acceptance 
for more complex  customized systems generally systems with a sales price greater than  the company recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion poc contract accounting methodology based on labor inputs 
billings under percentage of completion contracts are typically made upon the satisfaction of contractually defined milestones 
the company recognizes revenue from services when the services are performed or ratably over the related contract period 
all significant costs and expenses associated with maintenance contracts are expensed as incurred 
this approximates a ratable recognition of expenses over the contract period 
if contracts include multiple elements  each element of the arrangement is separately identified and accounted for based on the relative fair value of such element 
revenue is not recognized on any element of the arrangement if undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
the company s revenue recognition policies governing contract accounting  and  particularly  the use of percentage of completion accounting  are particularly sensitive to accounting estimates 
under poc accounting  the company recognizes revenue as it performs its contractual obligations based on an estimate of its progress toward project completion and often before receiving a customer s final acceptance of a project 
if the company overestimates its progress in a particular period  encounters significant problems as it continues toward project completion or is ultimately unable to complete a project  it may be forced in a future period to reverse revenues taken in the current period and or to recognize disproportionately less profit than was recorded in previous periods or envisioned at the inception of a project 
for contracts accounted for using the poc methodology as of february   a one percentage point change in the calculated completion percentage would have given rise to a million change in revenue for the year 
inventory valuation allowances inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials and work in process and net of allowances for items which the company will continue to use but which  given the slowdown in market demand  are held in excess quantities at year end 
allowances are determined quarterly by comparing inventory levels of individual materials and parts to historical usage rates and estimated future sales in order to identify specific components of inventory that are judged unlikely to be sold 
inventory is written off against allowances in the period in which disposal occurs 
actual future write offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand  customer negotiations  technology shifts and other factors 
impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment losses on long lived tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill  when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted projected cash flows associated with those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
in those situations  impairment loss on a long lived asset is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value  generally determined based upon discounted estimates of future cash flows 
actual future cash flows may vary from the estimates used in performing the impairment tests due to changes in customer demand and future actions taken by the company that increase or decrease its cost structure 
had such changes  if any  been foreseen  the company might have reached different conclusions as to the current impairment of long lived assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in its statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which become effective for the company s fiscal year beginning march  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal subsequent to february   the company has begun the transitional impairment tests required by statement no 
based on the preliminary results of those tests  the company expects to recognize a non cash  goodwill impairment charge of approximately million to be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal this loss was not indicated under the company s impairment policy described above in effect at february  the company also expects annual amortization expense to decrease by approximately million in fiscal as a result of its adoption of statement no 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting positions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt sfas no 
as of march   and does not expect that the adoption of the statement will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
sales the company is a technology leader in enhanced services for network service providers and automated and interactive information systems for enterprises 
the company operates in two global divisions  each focusing on a separate market 
the company s network solutions division  or nsd  provides products and services that are designed to create opportunities for network carriers and service providers to increase revenue through value added services and or reduce costs through automation 
the enterprise solutions division  or esd  provides automated customer service and communications systems that reduce costs and improve customer service levels through enabling accurate and efficient communication and transactions between an enterprise  its customers and its business partners 
in addition  nsd and esd each provides a suite of professional services that supports its installed systems 
services provided include maintenance  implementation  and business and technical consulting services 
to further leverage the strong return on investment offered by the company s systems offerings  both divisions also offer enhanced communications solutions to network and enterprise customers on an outsourced basis as an application service provider  or asp 
effective march   the company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting has been reflected as a charge to fiscal operations and is discussed below in income loss from operations and net income loss 
as a result of the change  the company recognized as part of fiscal sales million of revenue whose contribution to income is included in the cumulative effect adjustment and did not recognize million of sales whose contribution to income would have been recognized had the change in accounting policy not been adopted 
see the table of pro forma sales activity below 
as described under in process research and development below  the company s merger with brite in fiscal was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  results of brite s operations have been consolidated with those of intervoice effective with the company s second fiscal quarter of fiscal with no retroactive adjustments 
see the table of pro forma sales activity below 
beginning in fiscal  the company has defined esd and nsd as its two reportable segments 
in prior years  the company s operations were managed as a single segment 
to enhance comparability of the company s sales for fiscal  and  the sales information below reflects the company s current segment structure and is presented on both an as reported and an as adjusted basis 
the as adjusted amounts reflect pro forma sales as though the merger with brite and the adoption of sab had occurred as of the end of fiscal as adjusted as reported in millions esd systems sales esd services sales esd total sales nsd systems sales nsd services sales nsd total sales total company systems sales total company services sales total company sales intervoice brite s fiscal year ends the last day of february 
brite s fiscal year ended december no adjustment has been made to account for the two companies different fiscal year ends 
total company sales on an as adjusted basis declined in fiscal and in fiscal after increasing in fiscal the decrease in sales in fiscal was comprised of decreases in esd and nsd systems sales of and  respectively  a increase in esd services sales  and an decrease in nsd services sales 
the decline in system sales reflects the sharp decline in the company s primary markets for systems and services  particularly the decline in the market for telecommunications equipment and services during the year 
this decline was particularly pronounced in the fourth quarter of when the company s sales declined by from the third quarter of fiscal the company believes demand in its primary markets will remain sluggish through at least the first half of fiscal the nsd services decline reflects a reduction in the division s managed services revenues attributable to a decrease in the volume of activity processed under certain of the division s asp contracts including  particularly  its contract with bt cellnet as further described below 
the increase in esd services was primarily attributable to growth in the division s sale of extended warranty services 
the impact of foreign currency changes during the year on annual sales for fiscal was not material 
the decrease in sales during fiscal was primarily the result of an and decline in esd and nsd systems sales  respectively  partially offset by a increase in combined services sales 
the decline in systems sales during fiscal resulted from a sluggishness in demand from the former brite customer base  as those companies evaluated the company s product roadmap resulting from the merger with brite  a sluggish demand from the company s existing and prospective customers as they evaluated their post yk capital expenditures  some softness in the market for telecommunications equipment  computers  software and other technology products  and a lengthening of the overall sales cycle resulting from a transition in customer demand from relatively simple  touch tone based applications to complex applications employing speech recognition 
the fiscal results also included the impact of approximately million resulting from a stronger us dollar  on average  as compared to fiscal the company assigns revenues to geographic locations based on the location of the customer 
the company s net sales by geographic area for fiscal years  and were as follows in millions united states the americas excluding the us pacific rim europe  middle east and africa total international esd system sales constituted  and of total esd system sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
international nsd system sales constituted  and  of total nsd systems sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
international services sales constituted  and of the company s total services sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
prices for the company s products have remained stable  as measured by price per line shipped  during fiscal  and  although the features and functions per line shipped have become more robust 
one nsd customer  british telecom  together with its affiliate bt cellnet  accounted for  and of the company s total revenues during fiscal  and  respectively  and for  and of the nsd segment s revenues in those same periods 
monthly minimum managed service revenues under the bt cellnet contract declined during fiscal from a fiscal high of approximately million per month in march to a fixed fee of approximately million per month as of january in accordance with the terms of the customer contract 
the lower fee will continue through the remainder of the contract term 
the contract expires in july no other customer accounted for or more of the company s sales during fiscal   or the company uses a system combining estimated sales from its service and support contracts  pipeline of systems sales opportunities  and backlog of committed systems orders to estimate sales and trends in its business 
sales for the last four quarters from service and support contracts  including contracts for asp managed services  have comprised approximately of the company s sales 
on average  the pipeline of opportunities for systems sales and backlog of systems sales during the same period have each contributed approximately of quarterly revenues 
the company s service and support contracts range in duration from one month to three years  with many longer duration contracts allowing customer cancellation privileges 
as described above  a significant portion of the company s services revenue is derived from its contract with bt cellnet 
it is easier for the company to estimate service and support sales than to measure systems sales for the next quarter because service and support contracts generally span multiple quarters  and revenues recognized under each contract are generally similar from one quarter to the next 
the company s backlog is made up of customer orders for systems for which it has received complete purchase orders and which the company expects to ship within twelve months 
at february  and and february   the company s backlog of systems sales was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
february backlog is up approximately million from a fiscal low of million at november   the end of the company s third fiscal quarter  and approximately even with the million backlog reported at august   the end of the company s second fiscal quarter 
as a result of the general decline in backlog during fiscal and the reduction of revenues under the managed services contract with bt cellnet  the company will have to increase sales from its pipeline of opportunities for systems sales and or other service and support contracts to maintain or increase revenues in future quarters 
the company s pipeline of opportunities for systems sales is the aggregation of its sales opportunities  with each opportunity evaluated for the date the potential customer will make a purchase decision  competitive risks  and the potential amount of any resulting sale 
no matter how promising a pipeline opportunity may appear  there is no assurance it will ever result in a sale 
while this pipeline may provide the company some sales guidelines in its business planning and budgeting  pipeline estimates are necessarily speculative and may not consistently correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
while the company knows the amount of systems backlog available at the beginning of a quarter  it must speculate on its pipeline of systems opportunities for the quarter 
the company s accuracy in estimating total systems sales for future fiscal quarters is  therefore  highly dependent upon its ability to successfully estimate which pipeline opportunities will close during the quarter 
because many of the company s transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered  the size and timing of large transactions sales valued at million or more have historically resulted in sales fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
while  in the past  the impact of these fluctuations has been mitigated to some extent by the geographic and vertical market diversification of the company s existing and prospective customers  the company has become increasingly prone to quarterly sales fluctuations because of its sales to the enhanced telecommunications services systems market  which are generally large in dollar amount and unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
the company s markets are being transformed by the ongoing convergence of voice  data and internet technologies 
as a result  the company continues to investigate alternate methods of combining its products and services and is focusing on new  strategic partnerships to profit from this transformation 
the result of such investigations may lead the company to redirect its marketing efforts and or increase its investments in application engineering  customer service  research and development  sales  sales support  marketing and administrative personnel and resources to pursue new opportunities 
special charges fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed a comprehensive review of the current and future positioning of all product lines  including lines brought forward from its merger with brite  reevaluated its physical plant needs  and reviewed its aggregate staffing levels 
based on these reviews  the company took a number of strategic actions designed to lower costs and streamline product offerings 
as a result of these actions  the company incurred special charges of approximately million  including million for the write down of intangible assets and inventories associated with discontinued product lines  million for the write down of excess inventories  million for severance payments and related benefits  million for facilities closures  and million relating to the write down of non productive fixed assets 
of the total special charges incurred  approximately million and million were charged to the esd and nsd divisions  respectively 
the company does not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition related intangible assets to the divisions 
the workforce reductions and other adjustments are expected to reduce the company s quarterly expenses by approximately million from third quarter fiscal levels when fully realized 
such expense reductions could be offset  in part  by spending increases to pursue new opportunities being created in the company s markets by the convergence of voice  wireless data and internet technologies

the company believes the existence of recent losses in its us operations prevents it from concluding that it is more likely than not that us deferred tax assets will be realized 
if some or all of such reserved deferred tax assets are ultimately realized  approximately million of the valuation allowance reversal related to stock option deductions will not provide future benefit to income but will rather be credited to additional capital 
the company has not provided a valuation allowance for deferred assets associated with its foreign subsidiaries  because it believes it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
on march   the us federal tax law was changed to allow net operating losses for taxable years ending in and the company s fiscal and fiscal to be carried back five years rather than the two years allowed under the previous law 
under statement of financial accounting standards no

the loss from operations in fiscal is primarily attributable to the significant decline in the company s sales from to and  particularly  the extreme weakness in the company s systems sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal and to the effect of the previously described special charges 
while the company benefited throughout fiscal from cost reduction efforts started at the end of fiscal  its cost structures were too high to allow the company to operate profitably in the face of the sharp downturn in sales activity following the terrorist events of september  and the prolonged slowdown in the telecommunications markets 
the company s actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as described in special charges  above  are designed to allow the company to return to profitability at lower levels of sales activity during fiscal the decrease in fiscal operating income and income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  versus the previous year  is primarily attributable to the company s decision to continue investment in marketing  application engineering  and research and development resources without a corresponding increase in the company s sales 
these investments were made to continue to pursue opportunities in the esd and nsd markets

at february   the company s days sales outstanding dso of accounts receivable were days as compared to days at february  the fiscal calculation is negatively affected by the company s extremely weak fiscal fourth quarter sales 
cash flow from operations in the first two quarters of fiscal may be constrained by the abnormally low receivables level as of february  with the merger with brite in fiscal  the company now generates a significant percentage of its sales  particularly its nsd sales  outside the united states 
certain customers outside the united states are accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside the united states  the company may offer its most credit worthy customers such payment terms 
in fiscal and  customer extended payment terms had no material adverse impact on the company s dso s of accounts receivable 
however  there is no assurance such extended payment terms will not adversely impact dso s in fiscal and beyond

impact of inflation the company does not expect any significant short term impact of inflation on its financial condition 
technological advances should continue to reduce costs in the computer and communications industries
