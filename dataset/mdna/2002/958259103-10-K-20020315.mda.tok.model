item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to factors that have affected our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december   and certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in reference should also be made to our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  s  except per share amounts and operating data year ended december  percent change financial results revenues   gross profit   net income loss   income loss per share of common stock income loss per share of common stock assuming dilution net cash provided by operating activities   operating data average gas sales mmcf d   average ngl sales mgal d   average gas prices mcf average ngl prices gal 

net income increased million for the year december  compared to the increase in net income was primarily attributable to higher gas prices in compared to the prior year  increased production from the powder river basin coal bed methane development  and improved results from our marketing segment 
revenues from the sale of gas increased million to  million in the year ended december  compared to this increase was primarily due to an improvement in product prices and to a lesser extent from an increase in sales of natural gas purchased from third parties 
average gas prices realized by us increased per mcf to per mcf in the year ended december  compared to included in the realized gas price were approximately million of gains recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity gas volumes 
we have entered into additional futures positions for the majority of our equity gas for see further discussion in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
average gas sales volumes increased mmcf per day to  mmcf per day in the year ended december  compared to this increase in sales volume was primarily due to an increase in the sale of third party product 
revenues from the sale of ngls decreased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to this decrease was due to a reduction in sales volume and a decrease in product prices 
average ngl prices realized by us decreased per gallon to per gallon in the year ended december  compared to included in the realized ngl price were approximately million of gains recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity ngl volumes 
we have entered into additional futures positions for a portion of our equity ngl production for see further discussion in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
average ngl sales volumes decreased mgal per day to  mgal per day in the year ended december  compared to this decrease was primarily due to an intentional reduction in the sale of third party product as these types of sales were generating minimal margins 
also contributing to the reduction in overall sales volume was a decrease in the sale of product produced at our facilities as we did not recover ethane for a portion of due to low ethane prices 
product purchases increased by million in the year ended december  compared to overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products decreased to approximately in the year ended december  from in the decrease in the product purchase percentage resulted from improved marketing margins and the intentional reduction in the sale of third party ngl products 
marketing margins on residue gas averaged per mcf in this represented a significant increase as compared to the per mcf marketing margin realized during the increase in margin for the year ended december  primarily resulted from volatility in gas prices  gains realized on our firm transportation capacity and from the mark to market of transactions utilizing a portion of this firm transportation capacity primarily during and the mark to market of storage transactions for the winter season ending in march under mark to market accounting  which we adopted on january   the margin to be realized over the term of the transaction is recorded in the month of origination 
of the total margin earned in the marketing segment of million  approximately million resulted from the portion of sales transactions beyond including the marking to market at december  of our derivative positions as required by sfas no 
this margin is included in the financial statement caption non cash change in fair value of derivatives 
marketing margins on ngls averaged approximately per gallon in the year ended december  this represents a decrease as compared to the margin realized during of per gallon 
this decrease has resulted in our decision to intentionally reduce the sale of third party ngl products 
there is no assurance that these market conditions for our gas and ngl products and related margins will continue in the future  that we will be in a similar position to benefit from them or that we will continue to originate the same amount of transactions in future quarters 
on december   enron corp 
and many of its affiliates and subsidiaries filed a petition for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the southern district of new york 
at the time of enron s filing  our exposure to them totaled approximately million 
this amount includes the net exposure from physical gas transactions of  which is comprised of physical gas sales of million and physical gas purchases of million 
we have in place a netting agreement with enron for the purchase and sale of physical gas 
although similar netting agreements have been upheld by bankruptcy courts in the past  we can provide no assurance that our agreement will not be challenged or the outcome of any challenge 
the remaining million of net exposure is under a master swap agreement related to derivative transactions 
as a result  we incurred an additional charge to income of million in this exposure to enron is not included in the calculation of the marketing margins and is primarily reported in selling and administrative expenses 
plant operating expense increased million in compared to this increase was primarily due to additional leased compression in the powder river basin coal bed development and higher fuel costs at our plant facilities 
oil and gas exploration and production expenses increased by million in as compared to the increase in the period is primarily as a result of our overall increasing operations in the powder river basin coal bed methane development 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to  primarily as a result of our increasing operations in the powder river basin coal bed methane development 
extraordinary charge for early extinguishment of debt decreased for the year ending december  as compared to as a result of an after tax charge of million incurred in third quarter of in september  we prepaid million of outstanding indebtedness originally due to be paid in november  with funds available under our revolving credit facility 
in connection with this prepayment  we paid a pre tax make whole payment of approximately million and expensed capitalized fees of approximately  other information preferred stock redemption 
on november   we issued a notice of redemption for approximately  shares of our cumulative preferred stock at its liquidation preference 
this totaled million including accrued and unpaid dividends 
the redemption date was december  and was funded with amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
the pro rata capitalized offering costs of  associated with the redeemed preferred stock were reflected as a special dividend to preferred shareholders in and  accordingly  reduced earnings available to common shareholders by approximately per common share 
bethel treating facility 
in december  we signed an agreement with anadarko petroleum corporation for the sale of all the outstanding stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  pinnacle  for million 
the only asset of this subsidiary was a mmcf per day treating facility and miles of associated gathering assets located in east texas 
the sale closed in january and resulted in an approximate pre tax gain for financial reporting purposes of million in the first quarter of arkoma 
in august  we sold our arkoma gathering system in oklahoma for gross proceeds of million 
this sale resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
western gas resources california  inc in january  we sold all the outstanding stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  wgr california  for million 
the only asset of this subsidiary was a mile pipeline in the sacramento basin of california 
the pipeline was acquired through the exercise of an option by us in a transaction which closed simultaneously with the sale of wgr california 
we recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately million in the first quarter of the proceeds from these sales were used to reduce borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
westana 
in february  we acquired the remaining interest in the westana gathering company for a net purchase price of million 
the results from our ownership through february of a equity interest in the westana gathering company are reflected in revenues in other on the consolidated statement of operations 
beginning in march  the results of these operations are fully consolidated and are included in revenues and costs and expenses 
additionally  in march  our investment in the westana gathering company was reclassified from other assets to property and equipment 
granger complex 
in may  we acquired the remaining interest in a portion of the bird canyon gathering system serving the granger complex for a net purchase price of million in cash and the settlement of previously disclosed litigation 
in september  we signed an agreement with questar gas management company for the sale of a interest in a segment of the bird canyon gathering system along with associated field compression for million 
this sale closed in october these assets were reclassified on the consolidated balance sheet to assets held for sale at september  and a  pre tax loss on the excess of the net book value over the sales price of these assets was recognized in the third quarter of also in october  both questar and western contributed our respective interests in the bird canyon system along with additional field compression and gathering dedications for gas produced along the pinedale anticline to a newly formed joint venture named rendezvous gas services  llc each company owns a interest in rendezvous  and we will serve as field operator of its systems 
in the fourth quarter of  rendezvous began construction of additional gas gathering pipeline and compression facilities with a capacity to transport approximately mmcf per day of gas production from the pinedale anticline 
the first phase of this expansion is expected to be complete in march this gas will be delivered for blending or processing at either our granger complex or at a questar processing facility 
the total estimated construction cost of this expansion is million  of which our share will be million 
of this million  approximately million is expected to be spent in and is included in our capital expenditure budget 
our interest in rendezvous is accounted for under the equity method

net income increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase in net income was primarily attributable to significantly higher gas and ngl prices in compared to the prior year  increased production from the powder river basin coal bed methane development  improved marketing margins  an after tax gain of million recognized on the sale of the stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  western gas resources california  in the first quarter of and an after tax gain of million recognized on the sale of the arkoma gathering system in the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by after tax losses on hedging activities on our equity gas and ngls of million and an after tax extraordinary charge of million for the early extinguishment of long term debt  also in the third quarter of the results for the year ended december  were negatively affected by a combined after tax loss of million from the sale of the giddings  katy  mivida and black lake facilities and related severance charges  settlement of ongoing litigation and an after tax extraordinary charge of million for the early extinguishment of long term debt 
revenues from the sale of gas increased  million to  million for the year ended december  compared to this increase was due to an improvement in product prices in which more than offset a reduction in sales volume 
average gas prices realized by us increased per mcf to per mcf for the year ended december  compared to average gas sales volumes decreased mmcf per day to  mmcf per day for the year ended december  compared to this decrease was due to a reduction in the sale of gas purchased from third parties resulting from the sale in of our katy gas storage facility  which more than offset an increase in volumes available from our coal bed methane production 
revenues from the sale of ngls increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to this increase is due to an improvement in product prices and an increase in sales volume 
average ngl prices realized by us increased per gallon to per gallon for the year ended december  compared to average ngl sales volumes increased mgal per day to  mgal per day for the year ended december  compared to this increase in ngl volume is due to an increase in the sale of ngls purchased from third parties 
product purchases increased by  million for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to an increase in commodity prices and an increase in ngls purchased from third parties 
overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products remained the same at for the year ended december  and in marketing margins on residue gas averaged per mcf in this represents a significant increase as compared to the margins realized during of per mcf 
the margins realized in were reflective of the volatile market conditions and our ability to benefit from these conditions through our transportation arrangements 
marketing margins on ngls averaged per gallon for the year ended december  compared to approximately per gallon in there is no assurance  however  that these market conditions for our gas and ngl products and related margins will continue in the future or that we will be in a similar position to benefit from them 
in addition  during  we reserved a total of million for doubtful accounts 
this reserve is not included in the calculation of the marketing margins and is reported in selling and administrative expenses 
oil and gas exploration and production expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to these increases are due to increased production taxes and lease operating expenses resulting from our increased drilling and production activities in the powder river coal bed methane development 
selling and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to these increases are due to higher insurance costs  increased compensation and severance costs  increased accruals for doubtful accounts and compensation recorded for re priced stock options 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million for the year ended december  compared to primarily as a result of our increasing operations in the powder river basin coal bed methane development and our acquisition of the remaining of the westana gathering company in the first quarter of these increases more than offset reductions in depreciation from the sales of our giddings  katy  mivida and black lake facilities in in  we realized a net pre tax gain of million on the sale of our california subsidiary and our arkoma gathering system 
in  we realized a net pre tax loss of million on the sales of our giddings  katy  mivida and black lake facilities 
extraordinary charge for early extinguishment of debt increased by a net after tax charge of  for the year ended december  compared to in  we prepaid million of outstanding indebtedness to insurance companies  originally due to be paid in november  with funds available under our revolving credit facility 
in connection with this prepayment  we incurred approximately million for pre tax yield maintenance and other charges 
this compares to the prepayment in of million of indebtedness to various insurance companies 
in connection with the prepayments  we incurred approximately million for pre tax yield maintenance and other charges 
critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
for further details on our accounting policies  and the estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in applying these policies and a discussion of new accounting rules  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
our property and equipment is recorded at the lower of cost  including capitalized interest  or estimated realizable value 
interest incurred during the construction period of new projects is capitalized and amortized over the life of the associated assets 
depreciation on these assets is provided using the straight line method based on the estimated useful life of each facility which ranges from three to years 
useful lives are determined based on the shorter of the life of the equipment or the reserves serviced by the equipment 
the cost of acquired gas purchase contracts is amortized using the straight line method or units of production 
oil and gas properties and equipment 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities 
acquisition costs  development costs and successful exploration costs are capitalized when incurred 
exploratory dry hole costs  lease rentals and geological and geophysical costs are charged to expense as incurred 
upon surrender of undeveloped properties  the original cost is charged against income 
producing properties and related equipment are depleted and depreciated by the units of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our assets at the plant facility and oil and gas producing property levels 
in order to determine whether an impairment exists  we compare the net book value of the asset to the estimated fair market value or the undiscounted expected future net cash flows  determined by applying future prices estimated by management over the shorter of the lives of the facilities or the reserves supporting the facilities 
if an impairment exists  write downs of assets are based upon expected future net cash flows discounted using an interest rate commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying asset 
use of estimates and significant risks 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
these estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
however  actual results may differ significantly from the estimates used 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates will be recorded in the period in which the facts that necessitate a revision become known 
we are subject to a number of risks inherent in the industry in which we operate  primarily fluctuating prices  success of our drilling programs and other gas supply 
our financial condition and results of operations will depend significantly upon the prices we receive for gas and ngls 
these prices are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  we must continually connect new wells to our gathering systems in order to maintain or increase throughput levels to offset natural declines in dedicated volumes 
the number of new wells drilled will depend upon  among other factors  prices for gas and oil  the drilling budgets of third party producers  the energy policy of the federal government and the availability of foreign oil and gas  none of which are within our control 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
we continually monitor and revise our accounting policies as developments occur 
at this time  there are several new accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued  but not yet adopted  which may impact our accounting when these rules become effective in and environmental the construction and operation of our gathering systems  plants and other facilities used for the gathering  processing  treating or transportation of gas and ngls are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that can impose obligations to clean up hazardous substances at our facilities or at facilities to which we send wastes for disposal 
in most instances  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or waste management 
we employ five environmental engineers  four safety specialists and three regulatory compliance specialists to monitor environmental and safety compliance at our facilities 
prior to consummating any major acquisition  our environmental engineers perform audits on the facilities to be acquired 
in addition  on an ongoing basis  the environmental engineers perform environmental assessments of our existing facilities 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental laws and regulations 
environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning  designing  constructing and operating our facilities 
we believe that the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and regulations have not had and will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the texas natural resource conservation commission  which has authority to regulate  among other things  stationary air emissions sources  has created a committee to make recommendations to the commission regarding a voluntary emissions reduction plan for the permitting of existing grand fathered air emissions sources within texas 
a grand fathered air emissions source is one that does not need a state operating permit because it was constructed prior to we operate a number of these sources within texas  including portions of our midkiff benedum  gomez and mitchell puckett systems 
in connection with a modernization program  we are replacing all of our grand fathered compressors in texas and completed this project in march of other grand fathered sources are subject to increasing emissions fees beginning in we do not believe that such increases will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we anticipate that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be toward stricter standards 
we are unaware of future environmental standards that are reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations  but we cannot rule out that possibility 
we are in the process of voluntarily cleaning up substances at certain facilities that we operate 
our expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing facilities have not been significant in relation to our results of operations and totaled approximately million for the year ended december   including approximately  in air emissions fees to the states in which we operate 
although we anticipate that such environmental expenses per facility will increase over time  we do not believe that such increases will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
business strategy maximizing the value of our existing core assets is the focal point of our business strategy 
our core assets are our midstream operations in west texas and oklahoma and our fully integrated upstream and midstream assets in the powder river and green river basins in wyoming 
our long term business plan is to increase shareholder value by i doubling proven reserves and equity production of natural gas over the course of the next three to five years  ii meeting or exceeding throughput projections in our midstream operations  and iii optimizing annual returns 
appointment of chief executive officer in october  mr 
peter a 
dea was appointed president  chief executive officer and director effective november  mr 
dea was most recently the chairman of the board and ceo of barrett resources corporation 
he had been employed with barrett since in various executive positions  including executive vice president exploration 
prior to joining barrett  mr 
dea served as president of nautilus oil and gas company from to by amendment to our bylaws  the board of directors has been expanded from nine members to ten to allow for mr 
dea s appointment to the board 
mr 
lanny outlaw  our former chief executive officer and president  retired on october  mr 
outlaw intends to serve the remainder of his term on the board of directors  which expires in may liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been net cash provided by operating activities  funds available under our financing facilities and proceeds from offerings of debt and equity securities 
in the past  these sources have been sufficient to meet our needs and finance the growth of our business 
we can give no assurance that the historical sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future development and acquisition projects or for our other liquidity needs  and we may be required to seek alternative financing sources 
product prices  sales of inventory  the volumes of natural gas processed by our facilities  the volume of natural gas produced from our producing properties  the margin on third party product purchased for resale  or general downturns in the national economy  as well as the timely collection of our receivables will all affect future net cash provided by operating activities 
additionally  our future growth will be dependent upon obtaining additions to dedicated plant reserves  developing our existing leaseholds  acquisitions  new project development  marketing  efficient operation of our facilities and our ability to obtain financing at favorable terms 
we believe that the amounts available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with net cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient funds to connect new reserves  maintain our existing facilities  complete our current capital expenditure program including contributions to joint ventures  make any scheduled debt principal and interest payments and to pay common and preferred dividends 
depending on the timing and the amount of our future projects  we may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
our ability to secure such capital is restricted by our financing facilities  although we may request additional borrowing capacity from our lenders  seek waivers from our lenders to permit us to borrow funds from third parties  seek replacement financing facilities from other lenders  use stock as a currency for acquisitions  sell existing assets or a combination of alternatives 
while we believe that we would be able to secure additional financing  if required  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so or as to the terms of any additional financing 
we also believe that cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements for during the past several years some of our plants have experienced declines in dedicated reserves 
however  overall we have been successful in connecting additional reserves to more than offset the natural declines 
higher gas prices  improved technology  eg d seismic and horizontal drilling  and increased pipeline capacity from the rocky mountain region have stimulated drilling in many of our operating areas 
the overall level of drilling will depend upon  among other factors  the prices for oil and gas  the drilling budgets of third party producers  energy and environmental policy and regulation by governmental agencies and the availability of foreign oil and gas  none of which are within our control 
there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in replacing the dedicated reserves processed at our facilities 
we have effective shelf registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission for an aggregate of million of debt securities and preferred stock  along with the shares of common stock  if any  into which those securities are convertible  and million of debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 
our sources and uses of funds for the year ended december  are summarized as follows dollars in thousands sources of funds borrowings under revolving credit facility  proceeds from the dispositions of property and equipment  net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from exercise of common stock options  total sources of funds  uses of funds payments related to long term debt including debt issue costs capital expenditures including contributions to joint ventures preferred dividends paid  common dividends paid  re purchase and redemption of cumulative perpetual preferred stock contribution to equity investments  total uses of funds  inventories and storage capacity 
an additional source of liquidity available to us is our inventories of gas and ngls in storage facilities 
we continue to view access to storage capacity as a significant element of our marketing strategy 
we customarily store gas in underground storage facilities to ensure an adequate supply for long term sales contracts and to capture seasonal price differentials 
as of december   we had contracts in place for approximately bcf of storage capacity at various third party facilities 
the fees associated with these contracts during will average per mcf of annual capacity  and the associated contract periods range from three months to three years  with an average tenure of one and one half years 
several of these long term storage contracts require an annual renewal 
at december   we held gas in storage and in imbalances of approximately bcf at an average cost of per mcf compared to bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december  under these storage contracts 
these positions will be substantially liquidated within the first quarter of under mark to market accounting  the profit to be earned on these transactions was recorded in the month of origination 
at december   we also held ngls in storage of  mgal  consisting primarily of propane and normal butane  at an average cost of per gallon compared to  mgal at an average cost of per gallon at december  at various third party storage facilities 
these inventory positions will be substantially liquidated within the first quarter of firm transportation capacity 
we also continue to view access to firm transportation as a significant element of our marketing strategy 
firm transportation ensures that our equity production has access to downstream markets and allows us to capture incremental profit when pricing differentials between physical locations occur 
as of december   we had contracts for approximately mmcf per day of firm transportation 
this amount represents our total contracted amount on each individual pipeline 
in many cases it is necessary to utilize sequential pipelines to deliver gas into a specific sales market 
for example  to transport mmcf per day of gas produced in the powder river to the mid continent utilizes a total of mmcf per day of firm capacity on four separate pipelines 
the fixed fees associated with these contracts during will average approximately per mcf per day  and the associated contract periods range from three months to fifteen years 
in addition  some contracts contain provisions requiring us to pay the fees associated with these contracts whether or not the transportation is used 
we have also entered into mmcf per day of firm transportation precedent agreements for transportation on pipeline expansions which are not completed 
these expansions are anticipated to be completed in when the expansions are completed  we will enter into firm transportation agreements 
operating leases 
primarily to support our growing development in the powder river coal bed development  we have entered into several operating leases for compression equipment 
payments made on these leases are a component of operating expenses and are reflected on the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we had leased a total of compression units 
these leases have terms ranging from two to ten years with fair market purchase options available at various times during the lease 
total contractual cash obligations 
a summary of our total contractual cash obligations as of december  is as follows dollars in thousands payments by period type of obligation total obligation due in due in due in due thereafter long term debt      guarantee of fort union project financing  operating leases      firm transportation capacity agreements    firm storage capacity agreements    total contractual cash obligations    preferred stock repurchase and redemption 
in  we purchased in open market transactions a total of  shares of our cumulative preferred stock for a total cost  including broker commissions  of approximately  or an average of per share of preferred stock 
during  we purchased in open market transactions a total of  shares of this preferred stock for a total cost  including broker commissions  of approximately million  or an average of per share of preferred stock 
all of these shares will be retired in on november   we issued a notice of redemption for approximately  shares of our cumulative preferred stock at its liquidation preference 
this totaled million including accrued and unpaid dividends 
the redemption date was december  and was funded with amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
the pro rata capitalized offering costs of  associated with the redeemed preferred stock were reflected as a special dividend to preferred shareholders in and accordingly reduced earnings available to common shareholders by approximately per common share 
these transactions will reduce our preferred dividend requirements in future years 
capital investment program 
capital expenditures related to existing operations totaled approximately million during  consisting of the following i approximately million related to gathering  processing and pipeline assets  including million for maintaining existing facilities  ii approximately million related to exploration and production activities  and iii approximately million for miscellaneous items 
overall  capital expenditures in the powder river basin coal bed methane development and in green river basin in southwest wyoming operations represented and  respectively  of the total capital expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures related to existing operations to be approximately million during the budget represents an approximate decrease from the amount expended in due to an expectation of lower commodity prices 
the capital budget consists of the following i approximately million related to gathering  processing  treating and transportation assets  including million for maintaining existing facilities  ii approximately million related to exploration and production and lease acquisition activities  and iii approximately million for miscellaneous items 
overall  capital expenditures in the powder river basin coal bed methane development and in southwest wyoming operations represent and  respectively  of the total budget 
due to drilling and regulatory uncertainties that are beyond our control  we can make no assurance that our capital budget for will not change 
we anticipate that funds for the capital budget will be provided primarily by internally generated cash flow 
this budget may be increased to provide for acquisitions if approved by our board of directors 
financing facilities revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is with a syndicate of banks and provides for a maximum borrowing commitment of million consisting of an million day revolving credit facility  or tranche a  and a million revolving credit facility  or tranche b  which matures on april  at december   million was outstanding under this facility 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at certain spreads over the eurodollar rate  or the greater of the federal funds rate or the agent bank s prime rate 
we have the option to determine which rate will be used 
we also pay a facility fee on the commitment 
the interest rate spreads and facility fee are adjusted based on our debt to capitalization ratio and range from 
to 
at december   the interest rate payable on the borrowings under this facility was 
we are required to maintain a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than  and a senior debt to capitalization ratio of not more than at december  and of not more than thereafter 
the agreement also requires a quarterly test of the ratio of ebitda excluding some non recurring items for the last four quarters  to interest and dividends on preferred stock for the same period 
the ratio must exceed to through september  and increases to to at december  this facility also limits our ability to enter into operating and sale leaseback transactions 
this facility is guaranteed by  and secured via  a pledge of the stock of all of our material subsidiaries 
master shelf agreement 
in december  we entered into a master shelf agreement with the prudential insurance company of america 
amounts outstanding under the master shelf agreement at december  are as indicated in the following table dollars in thousands issue date amount interest rate final maturity principal payments due october   october   on october  and december   december  single payment at maturity october   october  single payment at maturity july   july   on each of july  through under our agreement with prudential  we are required to maintain a current ratio  as defined therein  of at least 
to  a minimum tangible net worth equal to the sum of million plus of consolidated net earnings earned from january  plus of the net proceeds of any equity offerings after january   a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than at december  and of not more than thereafter and a senior debt to capitalization ratio of not more than through march and not more than thereafter 
this agreement also requires an ebitda to interest ratio of not less than to increasing to a ratio of not less than to by march  and an ebitda to interest on senior debt ratio of not less than to increasing to a ratio of not less than to by march  ebitda in these calculations excludes certain non recurring items 
in addition  this agreement contains a calculation limiting dividends 
under this limitation  approximately million was available to be paid at december  this facility also limits our ability to enter into operating and sale leaseback transactions 
we are currently paying an annual fee of on the amounts outstanding on the master shelf agreement 
this fee will continue until we receive an implied investment grade rating on our senior secured debt from moody s investors service or standard poor s 
borrowings under the master shelf agreement are guaranteed by  and secured via  a pledge of the stock of all of our material subsidiaries 
in october  we made scheduled principal repayments to prudential totaling million 
in october  we will make a required principal repayment of million with funds available under the revolving credit facility 
senior subordinated notes 
in  we sold million of senior subordinated notes in a private placement with a final maturity of due in a single payment which were subsequently exchanged for registered publicly tradeable notes under the same terms and conditions 
the senior subordinated notes bear interest at per annum and were priced at to yield 
these notes contain maintenance covenants which include limitations on debt incurrence  restricted payments  liens and sales of assets 
under the calculation limiting restricted payments  including common dividends  approximately million was available at december  the senior subordinated notes are unsecured and are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by some of our subsidiaries 
we incurred approximately million in offering commissions and expenses which have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the notes 
covenant compliance 
we were in compliance with all covenants in our debt agreements at december  taking into account all the covenants contained in these agreements  we had approximately million of available borrowing capacity at december  item a 
quantatative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our commodity price risk management program has two primary objectives 
the first goal is to preserve and enhance the value of our equity volumes of gas and ngls with regard to the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow  net income and earnings per share in relation to those anticipated by our operating budget 
the second goal is to manage price risk related to our gas  crude oil and ngl marketing activities to protect profit margins 
this risk relates to fixed price purchase and sale commitments  the value of storage inventories and exposure to physical market price volatility 
we utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  exchange traded futures and options  as well as fixed index swaps  basis swaps and options traded in the over the counter  or otc  market to accomplish these goals 
these instruments allow us to preserve value and protect margins because corresponding losses or gains in the value of the financial instruments offset gains or losses in the physical market 
we use futures  swaps and options to reduce price risk and basis risk 
basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging 
basis risk is the risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged 
basis risk exists in natural gas primarily due to the geographic price differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery locations 
we enter into futures transactions on the new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  and the kansas city board of trade and through otc swaps and options with various counter parties  consisting primarily of financial institutions and other natural gas companies 
we conduct our standard credit review of otc counter parties and have agreements with many of these parties that contain collateral requirements 
we generally use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
otc exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review process 
our otc credit risk exposure is partially limited by our ability to require a margin deposit from our major counter parties based upon the mark to market value of their net exposure 
we are subject to margin deposit requirements under these same agreements 
in addition  we are subject to similar margin deposit requirements for our nymex counter parties related to our net exposures 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i equity volumes are less than expected  ii our customers fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas or ngls  or iii our otc counter parties fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against decreases in these prices 
hedge positions 
for  we have hedged approximately of our projected equity natural gas volumes and approximately of our estimated equity production of crude oil  condensate  and ngls 
these contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as such  gains and losses related to the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
any gains or losses on these cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations through product purchases when the hedged transactions occur 
gains or losses from the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized currently in earnings through non cash change in the fair value of derivatives and were immaterial in the year ended to qualify as cash flow hedges  the hedge instruments must be designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value must correlate with changes in the price of the forecasted transaction being hedged so that our exposure to the risk of commodity price changes is reduced 
to meet this requirement  we hedge both the price of the commodity and the basis between that derivative s contract delivery location and the cash market location used for the actual sale of the product 
this structure attains a high level of effectiveness  insuring that a change in the price of the forecasted transaction will result in an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the hedged commodity 
the table below details our hedged position as of december  the prices are nymex equivalent and do not include the transaction cost of the hedges 
we do not have any hedges in place beyond st half of nd half of natural gas  mmbtu per day with an average minimum of price of per mmbtu and an average maximum price of per mmbtu

as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of natural gas futures  swaps and options extending from january to october with a weighted average duration of approximately six months 
this was comprised of approximately bcf of long positions and bcf of short positions in these instruments 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of natural gas futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately months 
this was comprised of approximately bcf of long positions and bcf of short positions in these instruments 
we use a value at risk var model designed by jp morgan as one measure of market risk for our natural gas portfolio 
the var calculated by this model represents the maximum change in market value over the holding period at the specified statistical confidence interval 
the var model is generally based upon jp morgan s riskmetrics tm methodology using historical price data to derive estimates of volatility and correlation for estimating the contribution of tenure and location risk 
the var model assumes a one day holding period and uses a confidence level 
as of december   the calculated var of our entire natural gas portfolio of futures  swaps and options was approximately  this figure includes the risk related to our entire portfolio of natural gas financial instruments and does not include the related underlying physical transactions 
crude oil and ngl derivative market risk 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately  mgal of ngl futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately six months 
this was comprised of approximately  mgal of long positions and  mgal of short positions in these instruments 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately  mgal of ngl futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately six months 
this was comprised of approximately  mgal of long positions in these instruments 
as of december   we did not hold any ngl futures  swaps or options for settlement beyond as of december   the estimated fair value of the aforementioned crude oil and ngl options held by us was approximately  summary of derivative positions 
a summary of the change in our derivative position from december  to december  is as follows dollars in thousands fair value of contracts outstanding at december  adoption of sfas no

foreign currency derivative market risk 
as a normal part of our business  we enter into physical gas transactions which are payable in canadian dollars 
we enter into forward purchases and sales of canadian dollars from time to time to fix the cost of our future canadian dollar denominated natural gas purchase  sale  storage and transportation obligations 
this is done to protect marketing margins from adverse changes in the us and canadian dollar exchange rate between the time the commitment for the payment obligation is made and the actual payment date of such obligation 
as of december   the net notional value of such contracts was approximately million in canadian dollars  which approximates its fair market value 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  the fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after june  under sfas no 
 which was subsequently amended by sfas no 
 we are required to recognize the change in the market value of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income depending upon the nature of the underlying transaction 
also on january   we adopted mark to market accounting for the remainder of our marketing activities which  for various reasons  are not designated or qualified as hedges under sfas upon the adoption of sfas no 
and mark to market accounting on january   the impact was a decrease in a component of stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income of million  an increase to current assets of million  an increase to current liabilities of million  an increase to other long term liabilities of million and a decrease in deferred income taxes payable of million 
of the million decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the january  adoption of sfas  million was reversed during the year ended december  with gains and losses from the underlying transactions recognized through operating income 
the remaining  of this transition entry is currently anticipated to be recognized through operating income during the non cash impact to our results of operations in the year ended december   from the adoption of mark to market accounting for our marketing activities  resulted in additional pre tax income of million
