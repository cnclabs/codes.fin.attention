item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
overview consumer portfolio services  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  the company primarily engage in the business of purchasing  selling and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts contracts originated by automobile dealers dealers located throughout the united states 
in the past  the company has purchased contracts in as many as different states 
at various times in  the company suspended its solicitation of contract purchases in as many as states  and as of the date of this report is active in states 
there can be no assurance as to resumption of contract purchasing activities in other states 
through its purchase of contracts  the company provides indirect financing to dealer customers with limited credit histories  low incomes or past credit problems  who generally would not be expected to qualify for financing provided by banks or by automobile manufacturers captive finance companies 
the company historically has generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of its contracts  servicing fees earned on contracts sold  and interest earned on residuals  as defined below  and on contracts held for sale 
beginning with the year ended december  and through december   the company did not sell any contracts in securitization transactions  and therefore recognized no gains on sale from securitization transactions 
all sales of contracts during were on a servicing released basis  either in the form of bulk sales of contracts being held by the company for sale  or as part of a flow through agreement with a third party for which the company earned fees on a per contract basis  also known as the flow purchase program or purchases made on a flow basis 
during the year ended december   the company entered into another flow through agreement and proceeded to sell nearly all of the contracts purchased during the year to one or the other third party  for a mark up above what the company paid the dealer 
the company recorded a loss of million related to bulk sales in there were no bulk sales during or as a result of the company s flow through sales during the years ended december  and  the company recognized a million and million gain on sale of contracts  respectively  compared to a net loss on sale of contracts for the year ended december   of million 
one of the two flow purchasers ceased to purchase contracts in december the other flow purchaser has stated that it will cease such purchases in may the company accordingly expects the flow purchase program will terminate in may during the year ended december   the company purchased contracts other than on a flow basis to hold pending sale into a securitization  which it had not done in the two previous years 
funding for the other than flow basis purchases was available from the company s million revolving note purchase facility  established in november since november  the company has been able to purchase contracts for its own account using proceeds from that facility 
approximately of the principal balance of contracts may be advanced to the company under that facility  subject to a collateral test and certain other conditions and covenants 
notes issued under this facility currently bear interest at one month libor plus per annum 
the note purchase facility was modified during march  with the effect that sales of contracts to the facility related special purpose subsidiary sps are treated as an ongoing securitization 
the company  therefore  removes the securitized contracts and related debt from its consolidated balance sheet and recognizes a gain on sale in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
purchases of contracts made other than on a flow basis require that the company fund the portion of contract purchase prices beyond what the related sps was able to borrow in the continuous securitization structure  which in the aggregate required cash of approximately million in the year ended december  the company securitized million of contracts during the year ending december   resulting in a gain on sale of million 
on september   the company completed a million term securitization 
in a private placement  qualified institutional buyers purchased notes backed by automotive receivables 
the notes  issued by cps auto receivables trust a  consist of two classes million of class a notes  and million of class a notes 
substantially all of the proceeds from the september transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the company s revolving note purchase facility 
no additional gain on sale was recognized upon that term securitization 
total gain loss on sale  which also includes the company s estimate of its provision for recovery of losses and other related expenses was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues from interest and servicing fees for the years ended december  and  were million and million  and million and million  respectively 
such revenues for the year ended december   were million and million  respectively 
the company s income is affected by losses incurred on contracts  whether such contracts are held for sale or have been sold in securitizations 
the company s cash requirements have been significant in the past and will continue to be significant in the future 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was approximately million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for the year ended december   and net cash used in operating activities of approximately  for the year ended december  see liquidity and capital resources 
the company has historically purchased contracts with the primary intention of reselling them in securitization transactions as asset backed securities 
from late may through the first quarter of  the company primarily purchased contracts on a flow basis for third parties  that is  the company purchased a contract from a dealer  and sold the contract the immediately to the third party for a mark up above what the company pays the dealer 
the company retains no interest in such contracts  and neither services such contracts nor earns a servicing fee 
as noted above  the company expects the flow purchase program will terminate in may the company s securitization structure has generally been as follows first  the company sells a portfolio of contracts to a wholly owned sps  which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the company s contracts 
the sps then transfers the same contracts to either a grantor trust or an owner trust 
the trust is a qualifying special purpose entity and is therefore not consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the trust in turn issues interest bearing asset backed securities the certificates  generally in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
the company typically sells these contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse  except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to the company are provided by the company to the trust 
one or more investors purchase the certificates issued by the trust  the proceeds from the sale of the certificates are then used to purchase the contracts from the company 
the company may retain subordinated certificates issued by the trust 
the company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy  guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior certificates  from an insurance company the certificate insurer 
in addition  the company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the certificate insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account spread account held by the trust or in the form of subordinated certificates 
the agreements governing the securitization transactions collectively referred to as the securitization agreements require that the initial deposits to the spread accounts be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the spread accounts reach specified levels  and then maintained at those levels 
the specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related certificates 
the specified levels at which the spread accounts are to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions  and may also be varied by agreement among the company  the sps  the certificate insurer and the trustee 
such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the portfolios  and have also been varied by securitization agreement 
the securitization agreements generally grant the company the option to repurchase the sold contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance has amortized to or less of the initial aggregate balance 
the revolving note purchase facility continuous securitization structure is similar to the above  except that i the sps that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes issued directly by the sps  ii the initial purchaser of such notes has the right  but not the obligation  to require that the company repurchase the contracts  iii the promissory notes are in an aggregate principal amount of not more than of the aggregate principal balance of the contracts  and iv no spread account is involved 
the sps is a qualifying special purpose entity and is therefore not consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
at the closing of each securitization  whether a term securitization or the revolving note purchase facility continuous securitization  the company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet i the cash received and ii the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the company retains in contracts sold in securitization 
that retained interest the residual consists of a the cash held in the spread account  if any  b subordinated certificates retained  and c receivables from trust  which include the net interest receivables nirs 
nirs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the trust in the future  net of principal and interest payable with respect to the certificates  and certain expenses 
the excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the company over the carrying value of the contracts sold  less transaction costs  equals the net gain on sale of contracts recorded by the company 
the company allocates its basis in the contracts between the certificates and the residuals sold and retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale 
the company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the residuals  which are recorded at estimated fair value 
the company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the residuals  accordingly  the company determines the estimated fair value of the residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from the spread account the cash out method  using a discount rate that the company believes is appropriate for the risks involved and estimating the value of the company s optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreements 
the company estimates the value of its optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreements primarily based on its estimate of the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from existing receivables then outstanding and previously charged off receivables repurchased  using a discount rate that the company believes is appropriate for the risks involved 
the company has used an effective discount rate of approximately per annum 
the company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts 
in addition  the company is entitled to the cash flows from the residuals that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the certificates  the base servicing fees  and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees 
at the end of each collection period  the aggregate cash collections from the contracts are allocated first to the base servicing fees and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees for the period  then to the certificateholders for interest at the pass through rate on the certificates plus principal as defined in the securitization agreements 
if the amount of cash required for the above allocations exceeds the amount collected during the collection period  the shortfall is drawn from the spread account  if any 
if the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations  and there is no shortfall in the related spread account  the excess is released to the company or in certain cases is transferred to other spread accounts that may be below their required levels 
pursuant to certain securitization agreements  excess cash collected during the period is used to make accelerated principal paydowns on certain certificates to create excess collateral over collateralization or oc account 
if the spread account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level  then the excess cash collected is retained in the spread account until the specified level is achieved 
the cash in the spread accounts is restricted from use by the company 
cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality  liquid investment securities  as specified in the securitization agreements 
spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of the company s sps as the owner of the residuals 
the annual percentage rate payable on the contracts is significantly greater than the pass through rate on the certificates 
accordingly  the residuals described above are a significant asset of the company 
in determining the value of the residuals described above  the company must estimate the future rates of prepayments  delinquencies  defaults and default loss severity  and the value of the company s optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreements as they affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows 
the company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable contracts 
the company has used prepayment estimates of approximately to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts 
the company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable contracts and the specific characteristics of the contracts purchased by the company 
the company estimates recovery rates of previously charged off receivables using available historical recovery data and projected future recovery levels 
in valuing the residuals  the company estimates that gross losses as a percentage of the original principal balance will approximate to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts  with recovery rates approximating to 
in future periods  the company will recognize additional revenue from the residuals if the actual performance of the contracts is better than the original estimate  or the company would increase the estimated fair value of the residuals 
if the actual performance of the contracts were worse than the original estimate  then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the residuals would be required 
the authoritative accounting standard setting bodies are currently deliberating the consolidation of non qualifying special purpose entities and the accounting treatment for various off balance sheet financing transactions 
the effect of such deliberations may require the company to treat its securitizations differently 
however  the outcome of such deliberations is currently unknown 
the certificateholders and the related securitization trusts have no recourse to the company for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis 
the company s residuals  however  are subordinate to the certificates until the certificateholders are fully paid 
results of operations the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
during the year ended december   revenues increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  net gain on sale of contracts increased by million  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in the gain on sale component of revenue is the company s securitization of approximately million of contracts in the period  resulting in a gain on sale of contracts of million 
the availability and structure of the company s note purchase facility enabled it to execute securitization transactions during  no such sales occurred in the prior year period 
in addition  the company completed a term securitization in september substantially all of the proceeds from the september transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the company s revolving note purchase facility 
additionally  gain on sale of contracts includes the effect of fluctuations in the company s estimate of the required provision for losses on contracts and recovery of losses on contracts 
during  recoveries exceeded the provision for losses  in the provision for losses was greater than recoveries 
the company makes recoveries on contracts previously held on balance sheet or from pools for which the company has exercised its optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the securitization agreements 
the amount of contracts for which the company requires a provision for contract losses has contracted  while the amounts recovered has continued to increase 
as such the company is able to recover its provision for contract losses 
for the year ended december  the company recorded a reduction of the provision for contract losses of million  compared to a charge of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company sold million of contracts on a flow basis compared to million of contracts in the year ended december  the company expects the flow purchase program will terminate in may interest income increased million to million in the year ended december   from million in the prior year 
the increase in interest income is primarily due to the increase in residual interest income resulting from a change in the method residual interest income was calculated beginning in the second quarter of the increase in residual interest income is due to the company refining its methodology of calculation of such interest income beginning with the three month period ended june  the refined method is designed to accrete residual interest income on a level yield basis 
the company now uses an accretion rate that approximates the discount rate used to value the residual interest in securitizations  approximately per annum 
prior to such period  the company recognized residual interest income as the excess cash flows generated by the trusts over the related obligations of the trusts  net of any amortization of the related nirs 
this method of residual interest income recognition approximated a level yield rate of residual interest income due to the continued addition of new securitizations 
since the company had not securitized any contracts since december  this method would not have reflected the appropriate level yield and thus was refined during the second quarter of the effect of this refinement has been offset  in part  by the contraction of the company s servicing portfolio 
servicing fees decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  servicing fees are composed of base fees  which are payable at the rate of to  per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding contracts in the related trusts  plus any other fees collected by the company  such as late fees and returned check fees 
the decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the decrease in the company s servicing portfolio 
as of december   the servicing portfolio was million  compared to million as of december  expenses 
during the year ended december   operating expenses decreased by million  or  compared to the year ended december  personnel costs were effectively flat year over year  decreasing  or  to million in from million in personnel costs include base salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to employees  and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options  and are one of the company s most significant operating expenses  representing approximately of total operating expenses 
these costs generally fluctuate with the level of applications and contracts processed and serviced  with the mix of revenue and with overall portfolio performance 
other material operating expenses include facilities expenses  telephone and other communication services  credit services  computer services including personnel costs associated with information technology support  professional services  marketing and advertising expenses  and depreciation and amortization and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with servicing the company s portfolio 
interest expense decreased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the reductions in non warehouse indebtedness from the prior year 
see liquidity and capital resources 
marketing expenses increased by  or  and represented of total expenses 
the increase is primarily due to the increase in contracts purchased during the year ended december  fees paid to marketing representatives for their role in the submission of contracts ultimately purchased by the company are included as a component in gain on sale of contracts  net 
occupancy expenses decreased by  or  and represented of total expenses 
the decrease is primarily due to additional property taxes paid during  not due in in november  the company moved its headquarters to a new  square foot facility 
the company is leasing the new headquarters facility for a ten year term  with base rent of million for the first five years  and million for years six through ten 
in addition to base rent  the company pays property taxes  maintenance  and other expenses of the property 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by  or  and represented of total expenses 
the results for the years ended december  and  include net earnings of  and  respectively  from the company s subsidiary cps leasing  inc the increase in net earnings of cps leasing  inc 
is primarily attributable to the decision to cease lease receivable origination and to simply service the existing receivables  resulting in significant expense reductions 
the results for the year ended december   include net operating losses of  from the company s investment in of nab asset corp 
the company s effective tax rate was zero and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
during the year ended december   revenues increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  net gain on sale of contracts increased by million  from a million loss on sale for the year ended december   to a million gain for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase is that the prior year included sales of some million of contracts for less than their acquisition costs  resulting in a loss on sale of million 
net gain on sale also increased due to an increase in the number of contracts sold on a flow basis  and an increase in the average fee paid to the company per contract sold 
during the year ended december   the company sold million of contracts on a flow basis compared to million of contracts in the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  million and million  respectively  of provision for losses on contracts held for sale was charged against gain on sale 
interest income increased by  or  representing of total revenues for the year ended december  the increase in interest income is primarily due to the increase in residual interest income resulting from a change in the method residual interest income was calculated beginning in the second quarter of the increase in residual interest income is due to the company refining its methodology of calculation of such interest income beginning with the three month period ended june  the refined method is designed to accrete residual interest income on a level yield basis

since the company had not securitized any contracts since december  this method would not have reflected the appropriate level yield and thus was refined during the second quarter of the effect of this refinement has been offset  in part  by the contraction of the company s servicing portfolio 
servicing fees decreased by million  or  and represented of total revenue 
servicing fees consist of base fees  which are payable at the rate of to  per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding contracts in the related trusts  plus any other fees collected by the company  such as late fees and returned check fees 
the decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the decrease in the company s servicing portfolio 
as of december   the servicing portfolio was million compared to million as of december  expenses 
during the year ended december   operating expenses decreased by million  or  compared to the year ended december  employee costs decreased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease is due to the reductions of staff consistent with the decrease in the company s servicing portfolio 
the decrease was offset by an increase in employee costs of  related to the valuation of certain repriced stock options in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with servicing the company s portfolio 
interest expense decreased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses

the company s effective tax rate was and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in the effective tax rate in reflects the full utilization of net operating loss carryback availability  and the recording of a million valuation allowance on a portion of the company s net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s business requires substantial cash to support its purchases of contracts and other operating activities 
the company s primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operating activities  including proceeds from sales of contracts  amounts borrowed under various revolving lines of credit facilities also sometimes known as warehouse lines  servicing fees on portfolios of contracts previously sold  customer payments of principal and interest on contracts held for sale  fees for origination of contracts  and releases of cash from credit enhancements provided by the company for the financial guaranty insurer certificate insurer and investors  initially made in the form of a cash deposit to an account spread account  and releases of cash from securitized pools of contracts in which the company has retained a residual ownership interest 
the company s primary uses of cash have been the purchases of contracts  repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit and otherwise  operating expenses such as employee  interest  and occupancy expenses  the establishment of and further contributions to spread accounts cash posted to enhance credit of securitized pools  and income taxes 
there can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet the company s cash demands 
the sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools which determines the level of releases from spread accounts  the rate of expansion or contraction in the company s servicing portfolio  and the terms upon which the company is able to acquire  sell  and borrow against contracts 
net cash provided by used in operating activities for the years ended december   and  was million  million and  respectively 
contracts are purchased from dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount  and generate cash flow over a period of years 
as a result  the company has been dependent on revolving warehouse lines of credit facilities to purchase contracts  and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance its continuing operations  as well as to fund the portion of contract purchase prices not financed under lines of revolving credit facilities 
the company s contract purchasing program currently comprises both i purchases for the company s own account made on other than a flow basis  funded primarily by advances under a revolving warehouse credit facility  and ii flow purchases for immediate resale to non affiliates 
flow purchases allow the company to purchase contracts with minimal demands on liquidity 
the company s revenues from the resale of flow purchase contracts  however  are materially less than those that may be received by holding contracts to maturity or by selling contracts in securitization transactions 
during the year ended december   the company purchased million of contracts on a flow basis  and million on an other than flow basis for its own account  compared to million and million  respectively  of contracts purchased in for the year ended december   the company purchased million of contracts on a flow basis and million on an other than flow basis 
the company expects the flow purchase program will terminate in may during the year ended december   the company purchased contracts to be held for sale into a securitization  which it had not done in the previous two years 
funding for the other than flow basis purchases was available from the company s million revolving note purchase facility  established in november since november  the company has been able to purchase contracts for its own account using proceeds from that facility 
approximately of the principal balance of contracts may be advanced to the company under that facility  subject to a collateral test and certain other conditions and covenants 
notes issued under this facility bear interest at one month libor plus per annum 
the note purchase facility was modified during march  with the effect that sales of contracts to the facility related special purpose subsidiary are treated as an ongoing securitization 
the company  therefore  removes the securitized contracts and related debt from its consolidated balance sheet and recognizes a gain on sale in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
such purchases of contracts made on other than a flow basis require that the company fund the portion of contract purchase prices beyond what the related special purpose subsidiary was able to borrow in the continuous securitization structure  which in the aggregate required cash of approximately million in the year ended december  the company securitized million of contracts during the year ending december   resulting in a gain on sale of million 
on september   the company completed a million term securitization 
in a private placement  qualified institutional buyers purchased notes backed by automotive receivables 
the notes  issued by cps auto receivables trust a  consist of two classes million of class a notes  and million of class a notes 
substantially all of the proceeds from the september transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the company s revolving note purchase facility 
the company also purchases contracts on a flow basis  which  as compared with purchases of contracts for the company s own account  involves a materially reduced demand on the company s cash 
the company s plan for meeting its liquidity needs is to match its levels of contract purchases to its availability of cash 
cash used for subsequent deposits to spread accounts for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
cash released from spread accounts to the company for the years ended december   and  was million  and million  respectively 
changes in deposits to and releases from spread accounts are affected by the relative size  seasoning and performance of the various pools of contracts sold that make up the company s servicing portfolio to which the respective spread accounts are related 
as a result of the september term securitization transaction the company made an initial deposit to the related spread account of million 
no such initial deposits were made in or  as there were no securitizations during those years 
from june to november  the company s liquidity was adversely affected by the absence of releases from spread accounts 
such releases did not occur because a number of the trusts had incurred cumulative net losses as a percentage of the original contract balance or average delinquency ratios in excess of the predetermined levels specified in the respective agreements governing the securitizations 
accordingly  pursuant to the securitization agreements  the specified levels applicable to the company s spread accounts were increased  in most cases to an unlimited amount 
due to cross collateralization provisions of the securitization agreements  the specified levels were increased on the majority of the company s trusts 
increased specified levels for the spread accounts have been in effect from time to time in the past 
as a result of the increased spread account specified levels and cross collateralization provisions  excess cash flows that would otherwise have been released to the company instead were retained in the spread accounts to bring the balance of those spread accounts up to higher levels 
in addition to requiring higher spread account levels  the securitization agreements provide the certificate insurer with certain other rights and remedies  some of which have been waived on a recurring basis by the certificate insurer with respect to all of the trusts 
until the november effectiveness of an amendment the amendment to the securitization agreements  no material releases from any of the spread accounts were available to the company 
upon effectiveness of the amendment  the requisite spread account levels in general have been set at of the outstanding principal balance of the asset backed securities certificates issued by the related trusts  which were established in or prior 
the level is subject to adjustment to reflect over collateralization 
older trusts may require more than of credit enhancement if the certificate balance has amortized to such a level that floor or minimum levels of credit enhancement are applicable 
in the event of certain defaults by the company  the specified level applicable to such credit enhancement could increase from to an unlimited amount  but such defaults are narrowly defined  and the company does not anticipate suffering such defaults 
the amendment has been effective since november  and the company has received releases of cash from the securitized portfolio on a monthly basis thereafter 
the releases of cash are expected to continue and to vary in amount from month to month 
there can be no assurance that such releases of cash will continue in the future 
as of december   four of the company s nine remaining securitized pools had incurred cumulative losses exceeding certain predetermined levels  which  in turn  has given the certificate insurer the option to terminate the servicing agreements with respect to all of the pools 
the certificate insurer has held that option at all times from to the present  and has consistently waived its right to terminate the servicing agreements 
were the certificate insurer in the future to exercise its option to terminate the servicing agreements  such a termination would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and results of operations 
subsequent to december   the company exercised its optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreements on three of the four pools mentioned above 
the company continues to receive servicer extensions on a quarterly basis  and has recently received an extension through the second quarter of the company believes that the certificate insurer will continue to waive its right to terminate the servicing agreements because i there is no reason to expect that any replacement servicer would improve the performance of the pools and ii there are material costs and transition risks inherent in a transfer of servicing 
the company s ability to adjust the quantity of contracts that it purchases and sells will be subject to general competitive conditions and the continued availability of the revolving note purchase facility 
there can be no assurance that the desired level of contract acquisition can be maintained or increased 
obtaining releases of cash from the spread accounts is dependent on collections from the related trusts generating sufficient cash to maintain the spread accounts in excess of the amended specified levels 
there can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will generate cash in excess of the amended specified levels 
the acquisition of contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions  and the need to fund spread accounts when those transactions take place  results in a continuing need for capital 
the amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the company s contract purchases other than flow purchases  the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations  and the extent to which the previously established spread accounts either release cash to the company or capture cash from collections on sold contracts 
the company is currently limited in its ability to purchase contracts due to certain liquidity constraints 
as of december   the company had cash on hand of million and available contract purchase commitments from the revolving note purchase facility of million 
the company s plans to manage the need for liquidity include the completion of additional term securitizations that would provide additional credit availability from the note purchase facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the term securitizations on favorable economic terms or that the company will be able to complete term securitizations at all 
if the company is unable to complete such securitizations  servicing fees and other portfolio related income would continue to decrease 
credit facilities the terms on which credit has been available to the company for purchase of contracts have varied over the three year period ended december   as shown in the following recapitulation in november  the company entered into a warehouse line of credit agreement with general electric capital corporation the gecc line 
the gecc line provided for warehouse facility advances up to a maximum of million at a variable interest rate of libor plus the gecc line by its terms was to expire november  during  the company defaulted on the gecc line agreements and was required to repay all balances owed 
during august  all amounts owed under the gecc line were repaid and the agreement was terminated 
in november  the company entered into a warehouse line of credit agreement with first union capital markets first union line 
the first union line provided for a maximum of million of advances to the company  with interest at a variable rate indexed to prevailing commercial paper rates 
in july  the advance amount was increased to million 
in conjunction with the increase in maximum advance amount under the agreement  the expiration date was changed to july   renewable for one year with the mutual consent of the company and first union capital markets 
during  the company defaulted on the first union line agreement and was required to repay the balance outstanding in its entirety 
in june  the balance of the first union line was repaid in its entirety and the related agreement was terminated 
in december  the company entered into an overdraft financing facility  with a bank  that provided for maximum borrowings of million 
interest was charged on the outstanding balance at the bank s reference rate plus 
during  the overdraft facility was increased to million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  during  the company defaulted under the overdraft facility and was required to repay the outstanding balance in its entirety 
in november  the remaining balance outstanding under the overdraft facility was repaid in its entirety and the related agreement was terminated 
in november  the company entered into a revolving note purchase facility under which up to million of notes may be outstanding at any time subject to a collateral test and other conditions 
the company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase contracts  which are pledged to secure the notes 
the collateral test generally allows the company to borrow up to approximately of the price paid for such contracts 
notes issued under this facility bear interest at one month libor plus per annum 
the balance of notes outstanding at december   was million 
additionally  in march  the company entered in to a second revolving note purchase facility  under which up to million of notes may be outstanding at any time  subject to a collateral test and other conditions 
the company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase contracts  which are pledged to secure the notes 
the collateral test generally allows the company to borrow up to approximately of the price paid for such contracts 
notes issued under this facility bear interest at one month libor plus per annum 
capital resources prior to  and again in  the company has funded increases in its servicing portfolio through off balance sheet securitization transactions  as discussed above  and funded its other capital needs with cash from operations and with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and or equity 
the acquisition of contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions  and the need to fund spread accounts when those transactions take place  results in a continuing need for capital 
the amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the company s contract purchases other than purchases made on a flow basis  the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations  and the extent to which the spread accounts either release cash to the company or capture cash from collections on sold contracts 
the company plans to adjust its levels of contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from spread accounts with its capital requirements 
capitalization over the three year period ended december   the company has managed its capitalization by issuing and restructuring debt and issuing purchasing common stock and equivalents  as summarized in the following table for the years ended december  in thousands senior secured debt beginning balance    issuances  payments    restructuring  ending balance    subordinated debt beginning balance    issuances  payments   restructuring  ending balance    related party debt beginning balance    issuances  payments  ending balance    increase decrease of common stock and equivalents the mfn merger is not reflected in the table above 
the following review of the terms of such issuances of debt and equity shows that the company s cost of capital increased materially in  and then decreased somewhat in there were no material issuances in in april  the company borrowed million as a senior secured loan  which commenced amortization in may this loan bore interest at a rate equal to libor plus 
cps borrowed million from related parties in august and september  the terms of which were renegotiated in november  in connection with the issuance of million of subordinated notes to levine leichtman capital partners ii  lp llcp 
the million of subordinated notes issued in november accrued interest at per annum  are due november  and were issued together with warrants that allowed the investor to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
as renegotiated  the million of related party loans are subordinated both to the company s general and secured creditors and also to the llcp subordinated notes  accrue interest at per annum  are due june  and are convertible into an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
a related party also purchased million of company s common stock in july  at per share 
the cost of capital increased further in to meet a portion of its capital requirements  the company on april   issued million in subordinated notes to llcp the new llcp notes 
the notes bear interest at per annum and include warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
as part of the agreement to issue the new llcp notes  the company was required to restructure the terms of the million subordinated promissory notes discussed above 
such restructuring included an increase in the interest rate from to  a reduction in the number of warrants issued to purchase the company s common stock from  to  a waiver by llcp of certain defaults under the notes sold to llcp in november  and a reduction in the exercise price of the warrants from per share to per share 
among the agreements entered into in connection with the issuance of the new llcp notes were agreements by stanwich financial services corp 
sfsc  an affiliate of the then chairman of the company s board of directors  to purchase an additional million of notes and of the company to sell such notes 
the terms of such notes were to be not less favorable to the company then i those that would be available in a transaction with a non affiliate  and ii those applicable to the new llcp notes 
in august and september  the company issued million of such notes  bearing interest at per annum  to sfsc 
as part of that transaction  the company also agreed to issue to sfsc warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
in march  the company and llcp restructured the outstanding indebtedness of the company in favor of llcp  which had been in default 
in the restructuring i all existing defaults were waived or cured  ii llcp lent an additional million tranche a to the company  iii the proceeds of that loan net of fees and expenses were used to repay all of the company s outstanding senior secured indebtedness  iv the outstanding million of subordinated indebtedness in favor of llcp was exchanged for senior indebtedness tranche b  v the company granted a blanket security interest in favor of llcp  to secure both tranche a and tranche b  and vi llcp released sfsc and its affiliates including mr 
bradley  sr  mr 
bradley  jr  and mr 
poole  directors of the company of any liability for failure to invest million in the company 
tranche a has been repaid in accordance with its terms  tranche b is due november  and bears interest at per annum 
in each case the interest rate is subject to increase by in the event of a default by the company 
in the restructuring  the company paid a fee of  paid accrued default interest of  issued  shares of common stock to llcp  and paid out of pocket expenses of approximately  the shares of common stock issued were valued at approximately  which is included in deferred interest expense to be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt 
the terms of the transaction were determined by negotiation between the company and llcp 
also in march  the company s board of directors authorized the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock to sfsc in conjunction with the million of promissory note issued by the company to sfsc in august and september the shares of common stock issued were valued at approximately  which is included in deferred interest expense to be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt 
the company must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities  which require  among other things  that the company maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity  net worth  capitalization  investments  acquisitions  restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions 
the company is in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of december  such covenants relate primarily to financial reporting requirements  restricted payments and the company s debt coverage ratio as defined in the various debt agreements 
during the first quarter of  the company purchased a total of  of outstanding indebtedness held by llcp and sfsc 
the company purchased and retired  of subordinated debt held by sfsc in exchange for payment of  and purchased and retired  of senior secured debt held by llcp in exchange for payment of  the llcp debt by its terms called for a prepayment penalty of or  the additional or  paid in connection with its february prepayment was absorbed by sfsc 
llcp holds approximately of the company s outstanding common shares 
sfsc is an affiliate of the company s former chairman  charles e 
bradley  sr  and sfsc and mr 
bradley  sr 
together hold approximately of the company s outstanding common shares 
in july  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  of outstanding debt and equity securities of the company  inclusive of the mandatory annual purchase or redemption of  of the company s outstanding risrs subordinated debt securities  due as of december   the company had purchased million in principal amount of the risrs  and million of its common stock  representing  shares 
forward looking statements the descriptions of the company s business and activities set forth in this report and in other past and future reports and announcements by the company may contain forward looking statements and assumptions regarding the future activities and results of operations of the company

critical accounting policies the company believes that its accounting policies related to a residual interest in securitizations and gain on sale of contracts and b income taxes could be considered critical 
such policies are described below 
a residual interest in securitizations and gain on sale of contracts gain on sale may be recognized on the disposition of contracts either outright as in the company s flow purchase program or in securitization transactions 
in its securitization transactions  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company retains a residual interest in the contracts that are sold 
the residual interest in term securitizations and the residual interest in the contracts sold continuously are reflected in the line item residual interest in securitizations on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company s securitization structure has generally been as follows first  the company sells a portfolio of contracts to a wholly owned sps  which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the company s contracts 
the sps then transfers the same contracts to either a grantor trust or an owner trust 
the trust is a qualifying special purpose entity and is therefore not consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the trust in turn issues interest bearing asset backed securities the certificates  generally in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
the company typically sells these contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse  except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to the company are provided by the company to the trust 
one or more investors purchase the certificates issued by the trust  the proceeds from the sale of the certificates are then used to purchase the contracts from the company 
the company may retain subordinated certificates issued by the trust 
the company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy  guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior certificates  from an insurance company the certificate insurer 
in addition  the company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the certificate insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account spread account held by the trust or in the form of subordinated certificates 
the agreements governing the securitization transactions collectively referred to as the securitization agreements require that the initial deposits to the spread accounts be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the spread accounts reach specified levels  and then maintained at those levels 
the specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related certificates 
the specified levels at which the spread accounts are to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions  and may also be varied by agreement among the company  the sps  the certificate insurer and the trustee 
such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the portfolios  and have also been varied by securitization agreement 
the securitization agreements generally grant the company the option to repurchase the sold contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance has amortized to or less of the initial aggregate balance 
the revolving note purchase facility continuous securitization structure is similar to the above  except that i the sps that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes issued directly by the sps  ii the initial purchaser of such notes has the right  but not the obligation  to require that the company repurchase the contracts  iii the promissory notes are in an aggregate principal amount of not more than of the aggregate principal balance of the contracts  and iv no spread account is involved 
the sps is a qualifying special purpose entity and is therefore not consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
at the closing of each securitization  whether a term securitization or the revolving note purchase facility continuous securitization  the company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet i the cash received and ii the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the company retains in contracts sold in securitization 
that retained interest the residual consists of a the cash held in the spread account  if any  b subordinated certificates retained  and c receivables from trust  which include the net interest receivables nirs 
nirs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the trust in the future  net of principal and interest payable with respect to the certificates  and certain expenses 
the excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the company over the carrying value of the contracts sold  less transaction costs  equals the net gain on sale of contracts recorded by the company 
the company allocates its basis in the contracts between the certificates and the residuals sold and retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale 
the company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the residuals  which are recorded at estimated fair value 
the company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the residuals  accordingly  the company determines the estimated fair value of the residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from the spread account the cash out method  using a discount rate that the company believes is appropriate for the risks involved and estimating the value of the company s optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreements 
the company estimates the value of its optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreements primarily based on its estimate of the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from existing receivables then outstanding and previously charged off receivables repurchased using a discount rate that the company believes is appropriate for the risks involved 
the company has used an effective discount rate of approximately per annum 
the company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts 
in addition  the company is entitled to the cash flows from the residuals that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the certificates  the base servicing fees  and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees 
at the end of each collection period  the aggregate cash collections from the contracts are allocated first to the base servicing fees and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees for the period  then to the certificateholders for interest at the pass through rate on the certificates plus principal as defined in the securitization agreements 
if the amount of cash required for the above allocations exceeds the amount collected during the collection period  the shortfall is drawn from the spread account  if any 
if the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations  and there is no shortfall in the related spread account  the excess is released to the company or in certain cases is transferred to other spread accounts that may be below their required levels 
pursuant to certain securitization agreements  excess cash collected during the period is used to make accelerated principal paydowns on certain certificates to create excess collateral over collateralization or oc account 
if the spread account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level  then the excess cash collected is retained in the spread account until the specified level is achieved 
the cash in the spread accounts is restricted from use by the company 
cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality  liquid investment securities  as specified in the securitization agreements 
spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of the company s sps as the owner of the residuals 
the annual percentage rate payable on the contracts is significantly greater than the pass through rate on the certificates 
accordingly  the residuals described above are a significant asset of the company 
in determining the value of the residuals described above  the company must estimate the future rates of prepayments  delinquencies  defaults and default loss severity  and the value of the company s optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreements as they affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows 
the company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable contracts 
the company has used prepayment estimates of approximately to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts 
the company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable contracts and the specific characteristics of the contracts purchased by the company 
the company estimates recovery rates of previously charged off receivables using available historical recovery data and projected future recovery levels 
in valuing the residuals  the company estimates that gross losses as a percentage of the original principal balance will approximate to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts  with recovery rates approximating to 
in future periods  the company will recognize additional revenue from the residuals if the actual performance of the contracts is better than the original estimate  or the company would increase the estimated fair value of the residuals 
if the actual performance of the contracts were worse than the original estimate  then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the residuals would be required 
the authoritative accounting standard setting bodies are currently deliberating the consolidation of non qualifying special purpose entities and the accounting treatment for various off balance sheet financing transactions 
the effect of such deliberations may require the company to treat its securitizations differently 
however  the outcome of such deliberations is currently unknown 
the certificateholders and the related securitization trusts have no recourse to the company for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis 
the company s residuals  however  are subordinate to the certificates until the certificateholders are fully paid 
of the key economic assumptions used in measuring all retained interests remaining as of december  and  the discount rate remained constant 
the range of net credit losses used in measuring all retained interests as of december  and were as follows actual and projected prepayment speed actual and projected credit losses key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate percent and percent adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows december  dollars in thousands carrying amount fair value of residual interest in securitizations  weighted average life in years prepayment speed assumption cumulative estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  expected credit losses cumulative estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  residual cash flows discount rate annual estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in this table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses  which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
b income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income and combined state franchise tax returns 
the company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company has estimated a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely 
in determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets  future taxable income from the following sources are considered a the reversal of taxable temporary differences  b future operations exclusive of reversing temporary differences  and c tax planning strategies that  if necessary  would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which bet operating losses might otherwise expire 
new accounting pronouncements the company will adopt in future periods new accounting pronouncements 
for information on how adoption has affected and will affect the financial statements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk although the company utilized its revolving note purchase facility and completed a term securitization during the year ended december   the structures did not lend themselves to some of the strategies the company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk  as described below 
specifically  the rate on the certificates issued by the revolving note purchase facility is adjustable and there is no pre funding component to the revolving note purchase facility or term securitization 
the company does intend to issue fixed rate certificates and to include pre funding structures for future term securitization transactions  whereby the amount of asset backed securities issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts 
in pre funding  the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until the company sells the additional contracts to the trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre funded escrow account 
in pre funded securitizations  the company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts it subsequently delivers to the trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding  the amount as to which there can be no assurance 
in addition  the contracts the company does purchase and securitize have fixed rates of interest  whereas the company s interest expense related to the current note purchase facility is based on a variable rate 
historically  the company s term securitization facilities had fixed rates of interest 
therefore  some of the strategies the company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk do not currently apply 
the company is subject to market risks due to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through its outstanding indebtedness and to a lesser extent its outstanding interest earning assets  and commitments to enter into new contracts 
the table below outlines the carrying values and estimated fair values of such indebtedness december  carrying fair carrying fair financial instrument value value value value in thousands warehouse lines of credit   notes payable     senior secured debt     subordinated debt     related party debt     much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective 
when applicable  readily available market information has been utilized 
however  for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments  active markets do not exist 
therefore  considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items 
the subjective factors include  among other things  the estimated timing and amount of cash flows  risk characteristics  credit quality and interest rates  all of which are subject to change 
since the fair value is estimated and do not reflect amounts of which amounts outstanding could be settled by the company  the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different
