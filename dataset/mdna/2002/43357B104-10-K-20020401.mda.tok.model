item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the company for the years ended december   and and consolidated financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
general the primary source of revenues is the sale of broadcasting time for advertising 
in  we generated approximately of our gross revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and approximately from national spot advertising  which is sold by independent advertising sales representatives 
the balance of our revenues came from political  network sales and miscellaneous revenues such as rental income from tower sites  and from our internet operation 
the most significant operating expenses are programming expenses  and advertising and promotion expenses 
operating expenses are affected in part by the timing of promotion campaigns to improve audience ratings  the timing of acquisitions  and the financial performance of our new station formats 
the company has historically purchased primarily english language radio stations and converted the formats to a variety of spanish language formats 
as a result  the historical financial performance of acquired radio stations is not a good indicator of future financial performance 
a new start up radio station generates operating losses in its first year of operation 
the magnitude of operating losses is determined in part by the size of the market served by the radio station  the amount of promotion expense required to attract an audience to the station  and the size of the acquisition 
thus  the company s financial results in any given year can be affected by the timing  number  and acquisition cost and operating expenses of its start up stations in that year 
ebitda consists of operating income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or as superior to operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda does not take into account the company s debt service requirements and other commitments and  accordingly  it is not necessarily indicative of an amount that may be available for dividends  reinvestment in the company s business or other discretionary uses 
in addition  our definition of ebitda is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we calculate same station results by measuring the operating performance of each radio station format in the current period to the performance in the comparable period of the prior year for each station format that has been in a spanish language format for two or more years 
in some instances  existing station formats are moved to new radio frequencies 
in this case  the same station designation follows the format and the start up becomes the station that launches a new spanish language format 
in and  the company funded its acquisitions with available cash 
in addition  the company s financial performance benefited from interest income generated on the company s available cash balances 
in  the company will use its excess cash to acquire more start up radio stations and borrow from its million revolving credit facility the credit facility 
as a result  interest income and securities gains will decline and interest expense and long term obligations will increase

recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized and to be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a business combination completed after june  will not be amortized and will be evaluated for impairment 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of sfas no 
management believes the adoption of sfas no 
will materially reduce amortization expense and increase operating income  net income and net income per common share 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we will be required to reassess the useful lives of all intangible assets acquired on or before june   and make any necessary remianing amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption of sfas no 
in addition  to the extent that an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period after adoption of sfas no 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period after adoption 
in connection with the transitional cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired impairment evaluation  sfas no 
requires us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired is impaired as of the date of the adoption of sfas no 
to accomplish this  we must identify the reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and other intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption of sfas no 
the company defines its reporting unit to be an individual radio market 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the reporting unit s cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption of sfas no 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of income and comprehensive income 
amortization expense related to broadcast licenses  cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and certain other intangible assets was million for the year ended december  because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
and sfas no 
 it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these standards on our financial statements at this time  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
retains the requirements of sfas no 
to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
the statement also removes goodwill from its scope and covers the accounting for the disposal of long lived assets 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  management does not believe adoption of this statement will materially impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that long lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by those assets is less than the carrying amount of those assets 
when specific assets are determined to be impaired  the cost basis of the assets is reduced to reflect their current fair market value 
we performed a recoverability assessment of all of our long lived assets using an undiscounted cash flow model as of december  based on our assumptions  all long lived assets were determined to be recoverable 
revenue recognition revenue is derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local and national advertisers 
revenue is recognized as commercials are broadcast 
revenues from barter transactions are recognized as income when commercials are broadcast 
barter transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the goods or services received 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated using a combination of the aging of the accounts receivable balances and knowledge related to the ability of the company to collect specific accounts 
older accounts receivable are seen to be less likely to be collected and require a greater allowance 
specific accounts which are estimated to not be collected increase the allowance 
for additional information on our significant accounting policies  see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation has affected financial performance due to higher operating expenses 
although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable  we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our radio stations 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges and earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends the ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the company are computed by dividing pretax income from continuing operations after certain adjustments  by fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest expense on all long and short term borrowings and the estimated interest portion of rental expense 
set forth below are the ratios of earnings to fixed charges and earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends in thousands except ratios year ended december  earnings to fixed charges earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to interest rate risk on both the interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and interest paid on borrowings under the credit facility 
a change of in the interest rate earned on short term investments and interest paid under the credit facility would not have had a significant impact on our historical financial statements
