item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading manufacturer of technologically advanced electronic interconnect solutions for use in sophisticated electronic equipment 
our principal products are complex multilayer printed circuit boards  which are the platforms used to interconnect microprocessors  integrated circuits and other components that are essential to the operation of electronic products and systems 
our fiscal year consists of either the or week period ending on the last saturday in may 
fiscal years  and were week years 
for convenience  all of our fiscal years are presented as ended on may throughout fiscal  we continued our focus on customers who require advanced technology printed circuit boards and we enhanced our capabilities to meet our customers growing demand for quick turn production 
we were able to increase average selling prices by increasing our higher technology sales and by a significant increase in higher margin quick turn prototype and pre production sales 
current economic conditions have resulted in a significant under utilization of capacity  however  we have focused on reducing our cost structure and we continue to make improvements throughout our operations 
we significantly expanded our customer base in fiscal  adding new customers and many new programs with existing customers 
to ensure that we will be able to support the needs of our customer base once demand returns  we proceeded with our capacity expansion program on a selective basis 
we believe that the steps we have taken during the economic downturn position us for growth once demand returns 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  ii the disclosure of contingent assets and  iii liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate and update our estimates and judgments  including those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  realizability of inventories  impairment of long lived assets  amount of warranty obligations and valuation of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among other policies  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable the company recognizes revenue upon the shipment of its products to the customer provided that the company has received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  product returns are reasonably estimable  collection of resulting receivable is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
we maintain an allowance for estimated product returns based on historical experience 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and the profile of our customer mix 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions were to be less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include a significant decline in operating results relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets  changes in technology or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this review indicates that the value of an asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining depreciation period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the warranty obligation includes a provision based on historical experience  as well as reserves for specific issues we identify 
to the extent actual warranty charges vary from our historical experience  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets as management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these net deferred tax assets 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
however  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 

table of contents results of operations dollars in thousands results of operations information in dollars and as a percentage of net sales are as follows years ended may  percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit loss operating expenses engineering selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense other expense  net income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss comparison of fiscal years and net sales net sales were million in fiscal  a decrease of from net sales of million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the downturn in the electronics industry and the resulting decline in oem customer demand 
the decrease was slightly offset by improved average pricing resulting from a higher level of quick turn prototype sales and a higher percentage of more technologically advanced printed circuit board sales compared to the prior year 
premium revenue  consisting of both prototype and compressed lead time volume orders  comprised of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal premium revenue in fiscal consisted principally of prototype and pre production orders  while premium revenue in fiscal was principally comprised of compressed lead time volume orders 
consistent with industry conditions  we experienced a sustained downturn in customer demand for volume orders during fiscal however  as a result of enhancing our quick turn capabilities  we achieved a significant increase in the level of higher margin prototype orders during the year 
sales in the communications market segment decreased  but increased as a percentage of sales  in fiscal compared to fiscal the number of communications customers has increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal many of these new customers are relatively small companies  and our future business with these customers may be significantly affected by their ability to continue to obtain financing 
sales in our test and measurement and high end computing segments decreased as a percentage of sales due to reduced demand in those market segments as well as the significant growth in the number of new communications customers 
sales in the test and measurement segment are primarily to semiconductor test equipment customers  which have experienced a more significant downturn than other sectors within the test and measurement segment 
we do not anticipate sales in the test and measurement segment to increase until demand for semiconductor test equipment improves 
see business markets and customers 
sales to our five largest oem customers comprised of our net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal our sales to oems include sales made through contract manufacturers 
sales through contract manufacturers were of our net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal two 
table of contents customers each accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  and three customers each accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal see business markets and customers 
during the last part of fiscal  we experienced a slight increase in demand for volume orders  but capacity utilization rates in the printed circuit board industry remained below and pricing for both quick turn and volume orders was very competitive 
future demand and product pricing depend on many factors including product mix  levels of advanced technology  capacity utilization  competitive pressure in the circuit board industry  and economic conditions affecting the electronics industry in general and the markets we serve 
the current uncertainty regarding the level and timing of an economic recovery in our product markets and volatility in our customer forecasts makes our forecasting less reliable than in prior periods 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales  or gross margin  was negative in fiscal and positive in fiscal gross margin decreased in fiscal primarily due to the significant decrease in sales and resulting decrease in manufacturing capacity utilization 
decreased production volumes required fixed costs to be allocated over a lower number of units 
partially offsetting the negative impact of lower volumes was stronger pricing year over year resulting from a favorable sales mix 
see net sales 
we have aggressively implemented cost cutting measures over the last five quarters 
these measures have included a reduction in headcount through layoffs and attrition  mandated time off  limited hiring  salary and wage freezes  reduced discretionary spending  manufacturing process improvements  scheduled plant shutdowns and lower raw material and supply costs 
however  fixed costs are expected to modestly increase in the future as a result of our capacity expansion project 
until industry conditions improve and demand increases  we expect gross margin will continue to be negatively impacted by low capacity utilization 
our gross profit may also be affected by other factors  including product pricing  production yields and changes in our cost structure 
engineering our engineering expenses were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing and of our net sales in each of those periods  respectively 
the increase in engineering expense in fiscal resulted primarily from increased headcount 
greater levels of design assistance and engineering services in the early stages of product development are critical to engaging with new customers and supporting the increase in prototype work and higher technology products manufactured 
additional field application engineers were added to support the sales organization 
increases in engineering expenses were partially offset by the absence of incentive bonuses and mandated time off in fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  and million or of net sales  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense resulted from tight controls on discretionary spending and mandated time off 
although salary expenses have increased slightly due to strategic hires to strengthen the organization  headcount remains flat and bonuses decreased significantly in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  we reduced outside services and outside sales commissions and did not significantly increase our provision for bad debts and reserves for out of warranty costs in fiscal  as compared to fiscal interest income interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the decline in our investment balances and the lower yield on those balances as a result of falling interest rates 

table of contents interest expense interest expense declined to  in fiscal from million in fiscal due partially to million in principal payments on long term debt made in fiscal in addition  we capitalized approximately  of interest costs related to capacity expansion projects in fiscal compared to  in fiscal capitalized interest is amortized over the lives of the buildings and equipment to which it relates 
other expense  net other expense  net  increased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  primarily due to one time costs associated with early retirement of debt recorded in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate was a benefit of in fiscal compared to an expense of in fiscal excluding a one time benefit of  related to research and development tax credits from prior years recorded during fiscal  our effective tax rate would have been a benefit of for the year 
this effective rate reflected research and development tax credits related to fiscal and interest earned on tax exempt bonds 
the effective tax rate in fiscal reflected benefits from foreign sales exclusion and the resolution of irs tax issues 
we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be a benefit of approximately 
comparison of fiscal years and net sales our net sales were million in fiscal  an increase of from net sales of million in fiscal the increase in net sales for the year was primarily the result of a favorable sales mix partially offset by lower volume unit shipments  especially in the second half of fiscal the favorable sales mix resulted from a higher percentage of more technologically advanced printed circuit boards and premium revenue  both of which have higher average sales prices compared to the sales mix in the prior year 
in the first half of fiscal  premium revenues resulted primarily from compressed lead time volume orders as customers focused on availability of capacity rather than pricing 
in the last half of fiscal  consistent with industry trends  we experienced a downturn in customer demand for volume orders  but realized an increase in demand for prototype orders 
premium revenue  consisting of both prototype and compressed lead time volume orders  comprised of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal sales in the communications market segment increased in dollars and as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal the number of communications customers increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal our five largest oem customers comprised of our net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal our sales to oems include sales made through contract manufacturers 
sales through contract manufacturers were of our net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal three customers each accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal and gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of sales  or gross margin  was in fiscal and in fiscal gross margin increased in fiscal primarily due to a favorable product mix and cost reductions 
our product mix was favorable because we produced a greater proportion of advanced technology printed circuit boards and premium orders  which provide significantly higher gross margins 
our cost reductions consisted of higher production yields  manufacturing process improvements and lower raw material and supply costs because of better supplier arrangements 
the effect of cost reductions and a 
table of contents favorable product mix on gross margin in fiscal was partially offset by a significant decline in capacity utilization in the second half of fiscal engineering our engineering expenses were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing of our net sales in each of those periods 
the increase in engineering expense in fiscal resulted primarily from increased headcount required to support the higher technology products manufactured  higher production levels in the first half of fiscal and capacity expansion activities 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing and of our net sales in those periods 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense resulted primarily from an increased provision for bad debts  increases in sales and administrative headcount required to support our growth in the first half of fiscal and increased reserves for out of warranty costs 
interest income interest income increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal due to the short term investment of the million proceeds from the may public offering of common stock as well as cash generated from operations during fiscal interest expense interest expense declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to million in principal payments on long term debt and the capitalization of approximately  of interest costs related to the capacity expansion projects 
capitalized interest will be amortized over the lives of the buildings and equipment to which it relates 
other expense  net other expense  net  was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in other expense was primarily due to greater losses on the disposal of manufacturing equipment in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate was approximately in fiscal compared to in the reduction in the effective tax rate was due to benefits recorded in fiscal from foreign sales exclusion and the resolution of irs tax issues 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  we had million in cash and cash equivalents as well as million in short term investments 
we generated million in cash from operations in fiscal as a result of a net reduction in working capital  income tax refunds related to prior years research and development tax credits  and the net loss for the year adjusted for depreciation and amortization 
accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable decreased as a result of the lower levels of sales and production in fiscal 
table of contents cash from investing activities in fiscal was million 
cash from investments in corporate securities resulted from the maturity of these investments 
cash was used to purchase manufacturing equipment and facilities pursuant to our capacity expansion program 
we had capital commitments of approximately million as of may   primarily for manufacturing equipment at wood village 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million  and was used primarily to reduce the principal balance of our senior unsecured notes and to retire a secured note payable to tektronix  partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises 
shortly after the end of fiscal  we privately sold million of convertible debentures due may the debentures are unsecured  are convertible into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of  and are callable after august if certain conditions are met 
there is no principal amortization  and interest is payable quarterly beginning june the debenture contains an embedded derivative in the form of a put option whereby the holder has the right to put the instrument back to the company at if a change in control of the company should occur 
this put option will be marked to market quarterly and any effect will be shown in the statement of operations 
the company does not anticipate that the derivative will have significant value because no change of control is currently contemplated 
a portion of the proceeds of this financing was used to repay in full the remaining million outstanding under our senior unsecured notes 
the senior notes contained certain financial covenants  including minimum net worth  debt ratio and interest coverage ratio and a make whole provision covering potential prepayment penalties 
we were not in compliance with the covenant that specified a minimum interest charges coverage ratio for the fourth quarter of fiscal we had a secured note payable to tektronix inc with million outstanding at may   which bore interest at per year 
this note was paid in full in june we lease manufacturing equipment under an operating lease 
outstanding minimum lease payments at the end of fiscal were million  to be paid in monthly installments through november the lease agreement includes certain financial covenants including minimum net worth  debt to capitalization and debt service coverage requirements 
during the last two quarters of fiscal  we were not in compliance with the covenant that requires a minimum debt service coverage ratio 
the lessor waived compliance with this covenant for those periods 
in addition  this covenant has been waived by the lessor through the first quarter of fiscal we lease a  square foot manufacturing facility located in wood village  oregon under an operating lease 
monthly lease payments escalate at specific points over the minimum ten year term of the lease 
outstanding minimum lease payments at the end of fiscal totaled million 
payments on the initial term of the lease extend through july and we have the option to extend the initial term of the lease for three consecutive periods of five years each 
we issued a standby letter of credit for  to secure obligations due under employee health insurance plans 
this letter of credit expired on july  we also issued a letter of credit for  to satisfy requirements of the lease agreement for the wood village facility 
this letter of credit expires on february   and is collateralized with cash 
we guaranteed a note with a bank related to financing certain manufacturing equipment that was purchased by a subcontractor 
the company holds a security interest in the underlying equipment and at may   there was  outstanding on the note 
we also have consignment agreements with certain suppliers for raw material inventory  some of which obligate us to purchase inventory on hand upon termination of the agreement 
as of the end of fiscal  potential commitments under these agreements were insignificant 

table of contents the following summarizes contractual obligations for merix at the end of fiscal and the effect of such on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 
future minimum lease payments senior notes total pro forma total years ending may  thereafter less amounts due within year total long term obligations pro forma total reflects the issuance of million in convertible debentures and the payment of the senior notes subsequent to year end 
capacity expansion we commenced capacity expansion programs at both our wood village  oregon and forest grove  oregon locations in the first quarter of fiscal due to current industry conditions  the timeline for completion of this program has been significantly lengthened 
we have completed the construction of a  square foot leased manufacturing facility at wood village and have completed installation of critical equipment  but have deferred ordering non critical equipment at both locations 
we do not expect to start hiring at or operating the wood village facility until we are experiencing a sustained return of demand for volume production 
once we begin hiring and completing equipment installation at the wood village facility  we estimate it will take up to six months until significant production occurs and expect that full capacity will be available within approximately two years thereafter 
the total cost for the capacity expansion programs will be approximately million and we have incurred total costs of approximately million related to these projects to date 
we expect to fund our expansion projects with a combination of current cash resources  internally generated funds and financing 
once completed  we expect these expansion projects to increase production capacity by approximately and estimate our manufacturing facilities will support revenues of approximately million annually 
our planned capacity expansions involve significant risks 
for example  we may encounter construction delays  equipment delays  labor shortages or disputes and production start up problems that could prevent us from meeting our customers delivery schedules 
in addition  the electronics industry has historically been cyclical and is currently experiencing a significant economic downturn characterized by diminished product demand and over capacity 
we expect to incur new fixed operating expenses associated with our expansion efforts  including increases in depreciation expenses and lease expenses 
the current unfavorable economic conditions affecting major customers or the electronics industry in general may affect our ability to successfully utilize our additional manufacturing capacity in an effective manner 
if our revenues do not increase sufficiently to offset increased expenses  our operating results may be adversely affected 
we believe that our existing capital resources and cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 

table of contents risk factors affecting business and results of operations you should carefully consider the following factors that may affect our business  future operating results and financial condition  as well as other information included in this annual report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
if economic conditions further adversely affect the market for electronic products  we could continue to experience reduced sales and lower gross margins 
our business depends on the electronics industry  which is subject to intense competition  rapid technological change  short production life cycles and pricing and margin pressures 
when these factors adversely affect our customers  we suffer similar effects 
our customers are primarily manufacturers in the communications  high end computing and test and measurement segments of the electronics industry 
at any time  our customers can discontinue or modify products containing components manufactured by us 
this discontinuance or modification could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  the electronics industry has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand  rapid declines in average selling prices and over capacity 
the electronics industry is experiencing a recession and is likely to experience recessionary periods in the future 
the economic conditions affecting the electronics industry  in general  or any of our major customers  in particular  has adversely affected our operating results and may continue to do so in the future 
our revenues declined significantly from fiscal to fiscal competition in the market for electronic interconnect solutions is intense  and could reduce our sales and prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability 
the market for electronic interconnect solutions is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
we expect competition to persist and intensify  which could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we believe our major competitors are the large united states and international independent producers that manufacture multilayer printed circuit boards  provide backplane and other electronic assemblies  and offer quick turn services  such as dynamic details inc  honeywell  multek a division of flextronics international ltd  sanmina sci  ttm technologies inc  tyco international ltd 
and viasystems 
new and emerging technologies may result in new competitors entering our market 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have a number of significant advantages over us  including significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and manufacturing resources  preferred vendor status with our existing and potential customers  greater name recognition  and larger customer bases 
in addition  these competitors may have the ability to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  may adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements and may devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
we must continually develop improved manufacturing processes to meet our customers needs for complex products  and our basic interconnect technology is generally not subject to significant proprietary protection 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our sales if competition increases and we are unable to respond effectively 
during recessionary periods in the electronics industry  our competitive advantages in the areas of providing an integrated manufacturing solution and responsive customer service may be less important to our customers than they are in a more favorable climate 
our customers may become more price sensitive 

table of contents we believe price competition from printed circuit board manufacturers in asia and other locations with lower production costs may play an increasing role in the printed circuit board markets in which we compete 
while historically our competitors in these locations have primarily competed in less technologically advanced markets  they continue to expand their technology to include higher technology printed circuit boards 
these competitors may gain market share in the higher technology printed circuit board market  which may have a material adverse effect on the pricing of our products and our gross margin and may cause our sales to decrease 
because a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our revenue  our revenue could significantly decline if we lose a major customer or if a major customer demands less of our products or cancels or delays orders 
historically  we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
our top five oem customers represented  and of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
the loss of or decrease in orders from one or more major customers could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  many of our new customers are relatively small companies  and our future business with them may be significantly affected by their ability to continue to obtain financing 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly results of operations are subject to significant variation for a variety of reasons  including the following the timing and volume of our customers orders  price and product competition  changes in the mix of products we sell  the levels at which we utilize our manufacturing capacity  our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product  difficulties we may face integrating acquired operations  costs associated with adding new geographical locations or expanding our facilities  manufacturing process yields  raw material availability  and shortages of experienced labor 
each of these factors has had in the past  and may have in the future  an adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
in addition  a significant portion of our operations expenses are relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders 
any inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any revenue shortfalls may magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfalls on our results of operations 
as a result  our operating results may vary significantly from one quarter to the next 
acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  may divert management resources and may dilute shareholder value 
as part of our business strategy  we may make acquisitions of  or investments in  companies  products or technologies that complement our current products  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or production capacity or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 

table of contents in connection with these acquisitions or investments  we could issue stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  incur debt and assume liabilities  and incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets  or incur large and immediate write offs 
future acquisitions also could pose numerous additional risks to our operations  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization 
we may not be able to complete one or more acquisitions or integrate the operations  products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not able to retain or attract employees with sufficient know how to conduct our manufacturing processes  we may not be able to maintain or increase our production output and quality 
manufacturing printed circuit boards requires employees with sufficient know how to operate advanced equipment and to conduct sensitive and complicated manufacturing processes 
there is intense competition for these types of employees 
we have been successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number of these employees in our operations to date 
in the future  we may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of these employees 
if we lose key personnel  we could experience reduced sales  delayed product development and diversion of management resources 
our success depends largely on the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment or non compete agreements with our key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management were to resign  the loss of personnel could result in loss of sales  delays in new product development and diversion of management resources 
we do not maintain key man insurance policies on any of our personnel 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws 
we are required to comply with all federal  state  county and municipal regulations regarding protection of the environment 
electronic interconnect product manufacturing requires the use of a variety of materials  including metals and chemicals 
water used in the printed circuit board manufacturing process must be treated to remove metal particles and other contaminants before it can be discharged into the municipal sanitary sewer system 
as a result  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those governing the storage  use  discharge and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing processes 
although we believe our current manufacturing operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental legislation has been enacted and may in the future be enacted or interpreted to create environmental liability with respect to our facilities or 
table of contents operations 
we may be responsible for the cleanup of any contamination discovered at our current and former manufacturing facilities and could be subject to revocation of permits necessary to conduct our business 
further  we cannot guaranty that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our available funds for investment 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities 
we do not have interest rate risk in our long term debt and do not enter into interest rate swap agreements 
further information required by this item is included in note to our financial statements included in this report
