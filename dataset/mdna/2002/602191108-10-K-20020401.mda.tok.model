overview the company s military rugged business segment provides specialized computers and related peripheral equipment to the united states and foreign military defense departments 
equipment in this segment takes two primary forms 
the first of these is fully militarized products  usually designed especially for a particular mission area with demanding environmental and quality requirements 
the second of these is rugged products  usually based on a commercial baseline product  but adapted by the company to meet environmental and quality specifications that exceed the requirements for commercial products 
this segment can be further differentiated between the activities of miltope corporation and those of its owned subsidiary  iv phoenix group  inc prior to september   this entire segment had been impacted in recent years by reduced government spending and defense appropriations 
the militarized product area had been especially subject to defense budget cuts 
the long design cycle for these programs creates an intangible cost in the form of rapid technological obsolescence 
some military programs that would have sought militarized equipment some years ago have modified the requirements to reflect a need for rugged or commercial products 
this trend has tended to benefit sales of the company s rugged product line 
as the army has pushed for further digitization of the battlefield  the company has pressed forward its initiatives in the tactical and tactical supports areas 
budget constraints have forced the various services to upgrade rather than replace 
this has meant incremental sales in the company s mass memory and disk product lines 
through its commercial segment  the company develops  manufactures and markets commercial products primarily for transportation  telecommunications and in field maintenance markets 
its products are airborne printers  in flight cabin management and entertainment products  mass storage devices  and derivatives of rugged hand held intel based computers originally developed for military applications

miltope corporation effective august   all manufacturing operations of pgi  an operating division that is part of the military rugged segment  were shut down 
miltope has contracted with pgi to continue production of selective pgi products in miltope s facilities on a license fee basis 
all significant costs to close these manufacturing operations have been included in the financial results of the thirteen and thirty nine week periods ended september  the company believes any future costs associated with this shutdown of pgi operations will not be significant

the valuation allowance can be adjusted in future periods as the probability of realization of the deferred tax asset changes 
capital expenditures totaled  in   in and  in the increase in over was due to the need for new manufacturing equipment for production and testing in relation to the msd five year rugged laptop computer contract awarded to miltope in may of the decrease in expenditures from was due to a reduction in business development demonstration equipment needs

statement of financial account standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  presented elsewhere in this report on form k 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies that are described below 
inventories provision for slow moving and obsolescence the company has various components in its inventory that relate to discontinued products and warranty replacement parts and repairs 
the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto 
on an on going basis the company evaluates its estimates of loss provisions by using various reports and analysis to focus on inventory throughput trends  inventory composition and inventory utilization over discrete periods of time 
additionally  the company tracks projected parts usage to parts on hand inventory to minimize risk of overstocks 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company recognizes impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
in such cases  the company would record an impairment loss to reduce long lived assets to their fair value 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
outlook for the company the company believes that the events of september   have  and will continue to have  a profound effect on how every company in the united states does business 
as the war on terrorism has unfolded and expanded  overall military spending has increased dramatically and will continue to increase in the areas of computing and electronics over the next several years 
as this military spending expansion continues  the company believes that miltope will benefit from its continued efforts to meet military environmental requirements with modified commercial equipment and components 
the company believes the level of growth in revenue in the company s commercial airborne products market will remain low over the next twelve to eighteen month period 
despite this belief  the company continues to focus appropriate resources in the development of products for the airborne market as potential applications arise 
the company believes that its results will be favorably affected in the future with continued growth in the military coupled with the expected longer term recovery in its commercial airborne products markets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company is exposed to interest risk inherent in its financial instruments 
the company is not currently subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
the company has a term loan and an industrial development authority bond issue that are exposed to changes in interest rates during the course of their maturity 
both debt instruments bear interest at current market rates and thus approximate fair market value 
the company manages its interest rate risk by a periodically retiring and issuing debt and b periodically fixing the interest rate on the london inter bank offered rate libor portion of its revolving credit loan for to days in order to minimize interest rate swings 
a increase in interest rates from to 
would affect the company s variable debt obligations and could potentially reduce future earnings by approximately
