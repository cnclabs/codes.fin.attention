the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview to date  we have derived a significant portion of our revenues from licensing our solutions and providing professional services 
we generate recurring data center revenues by charging our data center customers a monthly fixed fee or a fee based on the number of their end users who use the solutions we provide  subject to a minimum charge 
we also generate recurring revenues by charging our customers a periodic fee for maintenance 

table of contents our priorities in included the rationalization of our operating cost structure and assets  a necessary task after completing six acquisitions in and combined with a focus on cost control  this rationalization was the impetus behind the improvement in our gross margin from in to in these and other operational accomplishments propelled s to a significant improvement in its financial performance 
revenues increased in to million 
similarly  net loss per share was significantly reduced to per share in from per share in additionally  we stabilized our cash flow 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operations and ended the year with million in cash 
in  while working to strengthen s s operational and financial performance  we also undertook the most extensive retooling ever of our technology 
due to rapid growth and numerous acquisitions  s products encompassed several overlapping technologies and applications 
in order to realize the full potential of an enterprise efinance solution  it was imperative to re write the technological architecture for the s suite of products 
during  we invested in the development of our new integrated s enterprise platform as the technology foundation for the s enterprise family of products 
the s enterprise platform enables financial services providers to leverage the interfaces built to their back end systems  share customer data across their enterprise and deliver comprehensive  integrated marketing programs 
the s enterprise platform provides an open  flexible  and scalable architecture that leverages existing legacy and third party applications 
additionally  the s enterprise platform allows financial services providers to move toward a standard platform to unify their channel strategy and provide transactional and crm capabilities to both their external and internal customers 
through our market leadership program  certain customers have provided us with valuable input on the architectural requirements and business capabilities that financial services providers need to deliver a consistent efinance experience across all customer interaction channels 
our enterprise platform was released for general availability during the first quarter of while we historically have not capitalized software development costs because of the insignificant amount of costs incurred between technological feasibility and general customer release  we may be required to capitalize certain software development costs in the future 
in order to optimize available research and development resources and meet development timeframes  we have established a relationship with an indian based development organization to assist us with portions of our product development 
we expect to expand this relationship in to a newly created development center in india 
acquisitions we have made numerous strategic acquisitions that were designed to provide additional technology  product and service offerings  additional industry experience  a broader client base and an expanded geographic presence 
in march  we acquired the assets and subsidiaries of point holdings  ltd  a dublin  ireland based multi channel crm application provider 
in february  we acquired regency systems  inc  a dallas  texas based provider of telephone and internet banking applications and web design services for community and mid market banks 
in september  we acquired software dynamics  inc  a west hills  california based provider of branch automation  teller  call center and crm solutions for financial institutions 
in april  we acquired davidge data systems  inc  a new york  new york based provider of order routing services to brokerage firms and q up systems  inc  an austin  texas based provider of internet financial services solutions to community and mid market banks 
in november  we acquired level next  inc  a provider of global trade banking systems 
in november  we acquired edify corporation  a santa clara  california based global provider of internet and voice e commerce portal solutions  fics group  nv  a brussels  belgium based vendor of financial electronic commerce and regulatory reporting software  and verticalone corporation  then an atlanta based consolidator  organizer and presenter of personal account information via the internet 
we sold verticalone to yodlee  inc in january 
table of contents we accounted for all of our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets liabilities recorded as goodwill 
other intangible assets include developed technology  customer lists and assembled work force 
the consolidated financial statements include the results of operations for the acquired companies from the date of acquisition  which for accounting purposes is generally the month end date closest to the actual date of acquisition 
operating segment information during  we conducted our operations in two business segments financial institutions and contact center automation technology 
in and  we operated a third segment  internet aggregation services  through our verticalone subsidiary 
through this segment  we provided technology that enables consumers to aggregate personal account information from multiple sources 
we sold our verticalone subsidiary to yodlee  inc in january accordingly  we eliminated the internet aggregation services segment in financial institutions segment 
our financial institutions segment builds  delivers and operates integrated  transactional and brandable applications and channel solutions for financial services providers worldwide 
the financial institutions segment provides customized solutions to large global and national financial institutions  as well as solutions that require little or no customization and are primarily sold to community and regional banks 
we maintain multiple offices and a worldwide professional services team to assist with customization and implementation of our applications 
we also provide hosting services 
in november  we completed the acquisition of fics group  nv  which included our financial reporting systems business unit that we reported in our financial statements as held for sale 
as a result  we did not include the operating results of frs in our statements of operations for or during the first quarter of  we determined that there was no reasonable market for the sale of frs and that we would continue to operate frs until we identified a suitable market for sale of the frs business or determined that continued operation of the frs business was no longer viable 
accordingly  we have included the results of the frs operations  which we do not consider material  in our statement of operations for as part of the financial institutions segment 
contact center automation segment 
our contact center automation segment offers enterprise customer interaction solutions  including interactive voice response  voice recognition  e mail management  web chat navigation and collaboration and computer telephony integration 
these solutions allow financial institutions and other organizations to automate  integrate and personalize interactions with customers through multiple channels 
using customer determined profiles and interests  our clients can notify their customers about new products or services 
calls that do require human assistance can automatically be routed to the most appropriate person 
all of these goals can be accomplished through a combination of channels  including telephone  internet  e mail  fax  and pager 
in addition  we offer a natural language speech recognition product and an optional marketing campaign management component that enables businesses to deliver products and services to targeted prospects consistently through multiple channels 
currently  a large portion of our contact center automation segment revenues comes from financial institutions 
our strategy is to leverage this domain expertise and the cross sell opportunities to benefit our entire organization 
all of our acquired businesses  except edify corporation  are part of our financial institutions segment 
the voice portal solution of edify makes up our contact center automation segment  and the remaining portion of edify is included in the financial institutions segment 
verticalone made up our internet aggregation services segment in and on january   we sold our verticalone subsidiary to yodlee in a stock for stock transaction in which we received an ownership interest of approximately in yodlee 
during  we accounted for our equity interest in yodlee as an equity method investment and recorded our equity interest in the net loss of yodlee in our statement of operations 
we are a reseller of yodlee s account aggregation services 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a description of our reseller agreement with yodlee 

table of contents restructuring plans in november  we approved a restructuring plan to streamline our operations  as well as to discontinue development on the edify retail banking platform 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees and closed several of our facilities worldwide 
during  we determined that  as a result of a softening in the domestic real estate markets  our original estimate of the costs to dispose of unused real estate was below the currently anticipated costs and the restructuring accrual was adjusted 
during the second quarter of  we approved a restructuring plan to streamline our european operations 
in connection with this plan  we reduced our european workforce by people and consolidated the majority of our european operations into two locations 
we continue to review our cost structure on a worldwide basis and look for additional ways to streamline our operations 
we believe that our efforts to streamline operations  including headcount reductions and consolidation of our operating facilities  have resulted in cost savings that have improved our results of operations and our cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  further adjustments to the restructuring accrual may be recorded in the future due to changes in estimates of lease termination reserves arising from changing real estate market conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
generally  we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under other assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies include those related to revenue recognition  estimation of our allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments  valuation and recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill  determination of technological feasibility and capitalization of software development costs  recognition of costs in connection with restructuring plans and merger related activities  valuation of stock options and warrants issued  and accounting for our equity method investment in yodlee 
revenue recognition 
revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is a key metric used by management  securities analysts and investors to evaluate our performance 
our revenue arrangements generally include multiple elements such as license fees for software products  installation services  customization services  training services  post contract customer support  data center services and  in some cases  hardware or other third party products 
software license revenue 
we recognize software license sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
for software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software provided there is 
table of contents evidence of an arrangement  collection of our fee is considered probable and the fee is fixed or determinable 
in certain of these arrangements  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to all elements of the arrangement 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the license element  we use the residual method under sop no 
to determine the amount of revenue to be allocated to the license element 
when the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we record revenue for the license and professional services over the implementation period using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for each contract 
for software licenses where the license term does not begin until installation is complete  we recognize license and professional services revenue when we complete the installation of the software 
for license arrangements in which the fee is not considered fixed or determinable  the license revenue is recognized as payments become due 
in certain instances  we recognize our software license revenue on a straight line basis over either the term of the agreement or  for contracts without a term  the estimated period during which post contract support is expected to be provided 
support and maintenance revenue 
revenues for post contract customer support and maintenance are recognized ratably over the contract period 
professional services revenue 
revenues derived from arrangements to provide professional services on a time and materials basis are recognized as the related services are performed 
revenues from professional services provided on a fixed fee basis are recognized using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for the contract 
data center revenue 
we recognize data center revenue in accordance with the multiple element arrangement guidance in sab no 
we also consider the applicability of emerging issues task force no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  to our data center arrangements on a contract by contract basis 
if we determine that a software element covered by sop no 
is present in a hosting arrangement  we recognize the license  professional services and data center revenue is recognized pursuant to sop no 
if we determine that a software element covered by sop no 
is not present in a hosting arrangement  we recognize revenue for the arrangement pursuant to sab no 
see a full discussion of our revenue recognition policies in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue on a substantial portion of our data center arrangements is allocated to the implementation and transaction processing elements using the residual method 
we have determined that our transaction processing services can be separated from the installation services as they represent separate earnings processes  evidence of fair value exists for the transaction processing services  and the transaction processing services are not essential to the functionality of any other element in the arrangement 
if it was determined that the implementation services cannot be separated from the transaction processing services in an arrangement  we would recognize the professional services revenue over the term of the data center arrangement or the expected period of performance  whichever is longer 
our contractual arrangements are evaluated on a contract by contract basis and often require our judgement and estimates that affect the classification and timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations 
specifically  we may be required to make judgments about whether the fees associated with our products and services are fixed and determinable  whether or not collection of our fees is reasonably assured  whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the related software product  whether we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  and whether we have verifiable objective evidence of fair value for our products and services  
table of contents additionally  we may be required to make the following estimates the period that we expect to provide post contract support when the agreement does not contain a specific term  percentage of labor hours incurred to date to the estimated total labor hours for each contract  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts  and the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts or billing adjustments 
if other judgements or assumptions were used in the evaluation of our revenue arrangements  the timing and amounts of revenue recognized may have been significantly different 
for instance  many of our revenue arrangements are accounted for using the percentage of completion method since the services are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
if it was determined that those services were not essential to the functionality of the software  we may have recognized the license revenue upon delivery of the license  provided other required criteria were satisfied 
further  if we determined that we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  we would defer all revenue and recognize it upon completion of the contract 
estimation of allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments 
we are required to report accounts receivable at the amount we expect to collect from our customers 
as a result  we are required to use our judgment to estimate the likelihood that certain receivables may not be collected or that we might offer future discounts or concessions for previously billed amounts 
as a result  we have established a discount allowance for estimated billing adjustments and a bad debt allowance for estimated amounts that we will not collect 
we report provisions for billing adjustments as a reduction of revenue and provisions for bad debts as a component of selling expense 
we review specific accounts for collectibility based on circumstances known to us at the date of our financial statements 
in addition  we maintain general reserves based on historical billing adjustments and write offs 
these estimates are based on historical discounts  concessions and bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
accordingly  our judgements and estimates about the collectibility of our accounts receivable affect revenue  selling expense and the carrying value of our accounts receivable 
valuation and recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be assessed by comparing their carrying value to the undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows expected to be derived from such assets 
if such evaluation indicates a potential impairment  we use discounted cash flows to measure fair value in determining the amount of the long lived assets that should be written off 
for long term cost and equity investments  we write down their carrying values if it is determined that an impairment is other than temporary 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge on goodwill and other intangible assets that we deemed were impaired 
see further discussion of this charge in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
during  we recorded impairment charges in the aggregate amount of million for cost basis investments that we deemed were impaired 
additionally  we recorded a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of on our investment in yodlee 
see further discussion of our equity investment in yodlee in note to the consolidated 
table of contents financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the aforementioned impairment charges required considerable analysis and judgment in determining the timing and amount of the charges 
if other assumptions and estimates were used in our evaluations  the timing and amount of the charges may have been significantly different 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which required us to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill at that date and will require us to perform impairment reviews thereafter  at least once annually 
the transitional impairment test requires us to identify our reporting units  determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units  and determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
at this time  we do not anticipate any charge resulting from the transitional impairment test  however  we have not completed our review 
while we will no longer record monthly amortization expense for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  future events and changes in circumstances may require us to record a significant impairment charge in any given period 
determination of technological feasibility and capitalization of software development costs 
we are required to assess when technological feasibility occurs for products that we develop 
based on our judgement  we have determined that technological feasibility for our products generally occurs when we complete beta testing 
because of the insignificant amount of costs incurred between completion of beta testing and general customer release  we have not capitalized any software development costs in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if we determined that technological feasibility had occurred at an earlier point in the development cycle and that subsequent production costs incurred before general availability of the product were significant  we would have capitalized those costs and recognized them over future periods 
we continue to monitor changes in the software development cycle and may be required to capitalize certain software development costs in the future 
recognition of costs in connection with restructuring plans and merger related activities 
during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of  we recorded charges in connection with restructurings 
see further discussion of the terms of these restructurings in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
at the date we approve a restructuring plan  we establish a liability for the estimated costs associated with that restructuring plan 
at that time  and thereafter until the plan activities are complete  the actual costs associated with the plan may differ from our estimates 
we use our judgment and information available to us at the date of the financial statements to reevaluate our initial estimates of the plan costs 
if we believe that our previous estimates are no longer accurate in light of current conditions  we adjust the reserve with a corresponding increase or decrease to current period earnings 
accrued restructuring costs at december  reflect our estimate of future rental obligations and other costs associated with office space that we do not plan to use in our operations as a result of the restructuring plans  offset by our estimate of sublease income for this space 
while we know the terms of our contractual lease obligations and related future commitments  we must estimate when and under what terms we will be able to sublet the space  if at all 
such estimates require a substantial amount of judgment  especially given current real estate market conditions 
actual sublease terms may differ substantially from our estimates 
any future changes in our estimates of lease termination reserves could materially impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses  we established reserves for certain contingencies that existed at the date of acquisition 
at that time  we believed that the resolution of the contingency would result in future cash expenditures that we estimated based on the information available at the date of acquisition 
as those contingencies are resolved  we reduce the related liabilities for any related cash disbursements or if we determine that the contingency is no longer likely to result in a loss 
any difference in the actual settlement amount is reflected as an adjustment to income or expense in the period of resolution 
these adjustments are included in the merger related and restructuring costs line item in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents valuation of stock options and warrants issued 
sometimes in the normal course of business  we have granted stock options or warrants to non employees and other third parties as consideration for services or in connection with other arrangements 
depending on the nature of the transaction  we may be required to record the issuance of such options or warrants as a reduction of revenue  a component of operating expenses or not at all  in the case of a like kind exchange of property 
generally  when we are required to reflect the issuance of such options or warrants in our statement of operations  we are required to reflect the transaction using the estimated fair value the options or warrants 
the valuation of financial instruments like these that do not have a ready market requires judgment 
we generally use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options and warrants 
this approach requires judgements about the volatility of our common stock  the risk free interest rate  our plans to pay dividends on our common stock in future periods  and the expected life of the options or warrants 
although these variables can be measured or quantified using information that is generally available to us  the actual information that is used in the determination of these variables requires judgement and estimates 
we do not record compensation expense in connection with the issuance of stock options to employees unless we grant such options at an exercise price below the fair market value on the date of grant 
however  we disclose the pro forma effect of these grants on our results of operations as required by sfas no 
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
the calculation of pro forma compensation expense under sfas requires the same judgments and estimates discussed above 
accounting for our equity method investment in yodlee 
on january   we sold our verticalone subsidiary to yodlee  inc in a stock for stock transaction in which we received an ownership interest of approximately in yodlee 
under the terms of the sale agreement  we have a voting interest in yodlee and we can nominate one of the seven board of directors seats of yodlee 
additionally  in connection with the sale  we entered into the following agreements with yodlee a sales representation agreement  a data center agreement  and a facilities sublease 
we are a non exclusive reseller of yodlee s aggregation services under the sales representation agreement 
we evaluated the terms of our investment in and relationships with yodlee  and concluded that we exert significant influence over yodlee 
accordingly  we are accounting for our investment in yodlee under the equity method 
the equity method of accounting requires us to record our share of the net losses of yodlee in our consolidated statement of operations 
our equity in the net loss of yodlee for the year ended december  was million  including the amortization of our excess investment over our share of yodlee s net assets and an impairment charge to write down our investment in yodlee 
if we determined that we did not exercise significant influence over yodlee  we would have accounted for this investment under the cost method 
under the cost method  we would have recorded the initial fair value of our investment in yodlee on our balance sheet 
however  we would not have recorded any share of yodlee s net losses during we would have evaluated the carrying value of the cost investment for recoverability and written down the balance for any impairments that are other than temporary

in addition  we provide general and

total revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in revenues resulted principally from increases in our software licenses  support and maintenance and data center fees 
during the year ended december   software license revenue increased million  or  support and maintenance revenue increased million  or  and data center revenue increased million  or 
our strategy is to focus on activities that will continue to increase these strategic revenue streams while placing less emphasis on professional services  which during the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million 
during  we continued to provide a substantial amount of implementation  hosting and product enhancement services through our financial institutions segment for one 
table of contents significant customer 
we derived and of our total revenues in and  respectively  from this customer 
the increase in our software license revenues is substantially due to significant license revenues recognized under contracts with three large international customers 
the increase in support and maintenance revenues during is primarily due to increased software license revenues as well as maintenance renewals from the growth in our installed customer base 
the increase in our data center revenue was primarily due to revenues recognized under contacts with two large european customers who were live in our global data centers during  as well as an increase in the overall numbers of end users 
during  one of our large european customers informed us of their intention to exit our european data center 
as a result  we amended our agreement with this customer to enable their exit from our european data center effective december  we do not expect to earn any data center revenues from this customer during or beyond 
however  we maintain an ongoing relationship with this customer for both voice and internet products 
also during  we amended our agreements with a large canadian bank  which has two subsidiaries that are current data center customers 
under the terms of the contract amendments  the large canadian bank consolidated its data center agreements with us and purchased additional product and service offerings from us 
we also experienced significant growth in our small to mid market financial institution data center customers in the united states 
although we expect many of our mid sized financial institution customers to choose our data center solution  we do not expect future growth rates to match that which we produced during we believe that many of our larger financial institution customers may consider moving their internet banking platform to one of our in house solutions 
as those transitions are made  we expect the related revenue stream will move from data center to software license fees and support and maintenance fees 
the terms and conditions of the agreements with another large european customer are currently being reevaluated by both parties 
for the year ended december   revenues from our financial institutions operating segment grew million  or  to million over the comparable prior year period 
this growth is primarily attributable to the increase in data center revenue and other strategic revenue as discussed above  offset by a decrease in professional service revenues 
a portion of this growth is related to the inclusion of a full year of activity for davidge and q up  both which were acquired in april and the inclusion of sdi for the fourth quarter of additionally  our revenues in the financial institutions segment increased as a result of the inclusion of the frs business unit during  which was previously classified as available for sale during revenues from the frs business unit were not material to our total revenues in revenues for our contact center automation operating segment increased million to million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to an increase in support and maintenance fees charged to an increasing installed base of customers 
also  there were increases in license fees and professional service fees resulting primarily from our ability to sell additional contact center products to our existing customer base 
other revenues are primarily related to the sale of third party hardware and software that is used in connection with our products 
other revenue decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
other revenue generally fluctuates based on the mix of products and services sold 
in future periods  we expect professional services revenues to become a smaller percentage of total revenues as we move towards a package solution which requires less customization than our previous products 
we expect to generate revenues from our new enterprise family of products during and beyond 
direct costs and gross margins 
direct costs decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
overall gross margins were and for and  respectively 
the decrease in direct costs and corresponding increase in gross margins are primarily the result of reductions in employee headcount  reduction in the use of higher cost outside contractors  our ability to leverage existing data center 
table of contents infrastructure against increased revenues and reduced facilities charges from the consolidation of offices 
cost of revenues excludes charges for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 
direct software license costs for our financial institution software products are generally minimal because we internally develop most of the software components  the cost of which is reflected in product development expense as it is incurred 
direct software license costs for our contact center automation products consist of third party software used in the products 
overall direct software license costs decreased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margins on software licenses were and for and  respectively 
we anticipate that direct costs associated with software licenses as a percentage of revenue could increase in future periods as additional products are sold that include third party software 
direct costs for support and maintenance and professional services consist primarily of personnel and related infrastructure costs 
direct costs associated with support and maintenance and professional services decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease in direct costs is primarily the result of reducing professional services headcount  a reduction in the use of outside contractors and associated facilities costs to a level that is more closely aligned with the projects and services under contract 
gross margins on support and maintenance and professional services were and for and  respectively 
the increase in gross margins is attributable to the increase in the ratio of employees to outside contractors performing services and the completion of lower margin contracts inherited as a part of the acquisitions made at the end of we do not expect our gross margins on our professional services and post contact support services to increase significantly in the future 
direct data center costs consist of personnel and infrastructure to support the applications we host for our customers 
direct data center costs increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in costs relates to additional personnel and infrastructure necessary to support new customers and add new applications for our existing customers 
the gross margin for data center operations was and for and  respectively 
we increased the gross margin on our data center operations through our ability to leverage increasing revenue against the fixed data center costs 
selling and marketing expenses 
total selling and marketing expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we eliminated million of selling and marketing expenses in connection with the sale of verticalone 
this was offset by an increase of million to selling and marketing expenses related to the strengthening of our sales team and marketing programs and the addition of davidge and q up 
during  we invested in sales and marketing activities to increase our market share and promote our enterprise e finance products 
our marketing efforts include participating in and exhibiting at industry conferences and trade shows  maintaining memberships in key industry organizations and establishing close relationships with industry analysts to help guide product development and marketing efforts 
product development expenses 
total product development expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the elimination of million of product development expenses in connection with the sale of verticalone 
additionally  we reduced the number of domestic outside contractors in and replaced them with lower cost offshore contractors 
during  our product development efforts were focused on the s enterprise platform  a fully integrated system that leverages off our existing technology 
we launched enterprise platform for general release in march during  we spent a portion of our product development efforts on the completion of our acquired in process development projects 
while we historically have not capitalized product development costs  we may be required to capitalize certain software development costs in the future 
in order to optimize available research and development resources and meet development timeframes  we have established a relationship with an indian based development organization to outsource portions of our product development 
we expect to expand this relationship in to a newly created development center in india 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  a portion of the increase reflects the addition of q up and davidge  both of which were acquired in the second quarter of as we continue to strengthen our executive and management teams  our general and administrative salaries and related personnel charges have increased from the prior year period 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to of total revenues for  from for this decrease is attributable our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure against increasing revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of 
these increases were primarily the result of the depreciation recorded on additional property and equipment 
marketing cost from warrants issued

amortization and impairment of acquisition intangible assets 
amortization and impairment of acquisition intangible assets increased billion to billion for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of the increase  approximately million related to the amortization of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets resulting from the three acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and the two acquisitions in the second quarter of and million related to an impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions of edify  fics  verticalone and q up  we allocated a portion of the respective purchase prices to acquired in process research and development based on appraisals prepared by independent valuation consultants 
we determined the fair value of in process research and development for each of the above acquisitions using an income approach 
this involved estimating the present value of the after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased in process research and development  using risk adjusted discount rates and revenue forecasts as appropriate 
estimates of future cash flows related to the in process research and development were made for each project based on our estimates of revenue  operating expenses and income taxes from the project 
these estimates were consistent with historical pricing  margins and expense levels for similar products 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and charges for the use of contributory assets were deducted from estimated revenues to determine estimated after tax cash flows for each project 
estimated operating expenses include cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development 
table of contents expenses 
the research and development expenses include estimated costs to maintain the products once they have been introduced into the market 
the selection of the discount rate was based on consideration of our weighted average cost of capital  as well as factors including the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances that were known at the time  and the stage of completion of each technology 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts represent fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would have paid for the projects 
at the date of acquisition  the in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the values allocated to these projects were immediately expensed upon acquisition 
where appropriate  we deducted an amount reflecting the contribution of developed technology to the anticipated cash flows of in process research and development projects 
our product pricing and growth rates may not be achieved and we may not realize the financial benefits expected from the projects 
the acquisitions and related in process research and development expenses are detailed in the table below in process costs to company acquisition date purchase price r d expense complete in millions edify november  fics november  verticalone november  q up april  development of the in process technology acquired in these transactions reached technological feasibility within the estimates used in valuing the technology

table of contents operating activities 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operations was million compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended december  the improvement in net cash flows from operating activities generally reflects the decrease in our net loss plus the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities 
changes in operating assets and liabilities  especially trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and accrued expenses  are generally the result of timing differences between the collection of fees billed and payment of operating expenses 
although we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december   a significant portion of our loss was comprised of non cash items including million of depreciation and amortization  including acquisition intangibles  million in the equity interest in net loss of an affiliate  million in losses recorded on the sale of subsidiaries  million to provide for doubtful accounts receivable and billing adjustments  and million write down of cost basis equity investments for other than temporary impairments 
the change in operating assets and liabilities of million was primarily due to a million decrease in accounts receivable resulting from aggressive collection efforts and a significant improvement in days sales outstanding  offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million as a result of the timing of payments 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  included the effects of our net loss for the period of billion offset by non cash charges of approximately billion  a gain on the sale of investment securities of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and the reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in the comparable period of in  we sold our verticalone subsidiary  including million in cash  and we spent million in connection with the acquisition of sdi  net of cash received 
during  we received million in connection with businesses that we acquired and invested million in companies that are considered to have technology or products that complement our product and services offerings 
during and  we received million and million  respectively from the sale of investment securities 
in  we purchased million of property and equipment as compared to million in during  our property and equipment purchases were primarily related to leasehold improvements for our new corporate headquarters and computer equipment 
the purchases of property and equipment made in were primarily related to the purchase of equipment required for our global data center facilities 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in in  we received million from the sale of common stock under our employee stock plans 
in  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of preferred stock and million from the sale of common stock under our stock plans 
we paid million and million for capital lease obligations in and in and  we repaid borrowings of million and million  respectively 
in  we entered into an arrangement for a million secured line of credit with a bank 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings and the full million was available for borrowing under the secured line of credit 

table of contents in connection with the lease on our corporate offices  we issued to our landlord a standby letter of credit in the amount of million to guarantee certain obligations under the lease agreement 
the amount of the letter of credit reduces as our rent obligation declines 
at december   there were no drawings outstanding under the letter of credit 
we lease office space and computer equipment under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through we also lease certain computer equipment under capital lease arrangements 
future minimum payments under operating and capital leases  net of operating sublease income  are million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
we believe that our expected cash flows from operations together with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or issue debt securities or establish an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the addition of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the foreign currency financial statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates  except revenues and expenses  which are translated at average exchange rates during each reporting period 
net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk occurs when translating the financial results of our international operations to us dollars in consolidation 
at this time  we do not use financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure because the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations would not be material 
the net assets of our foreign operations at december  were approximately million 
for our operations located in countries participating in the european union  we adopted the euro as our common legal currency effective january  on january   all countries participating in the european union began using the euro as their currency 
we have not experienced any significant problems related to the euro conversion and do not expect the euro conversion to have a material impact on our results of operations 
our capital lease obligations include only fixed rates of interest 
therefore  we do not believe there is any material exposure to market risk changes in interest rates relating to our capital lease obligations
