with the additional equity financing at the end of march  we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand to fund our future operational capital requirements and expenditures and a sufficient level of capital in order to fund specific research and development projects or to pursue additional strategic acquisitions 
however  if we need additional capital funding in the future to further our strategic plans  there can be no assurance that any additional funding will be available to us  or if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if we are successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of the financing may have the effect of significantly diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our common stock 
we believe that if we are not successful in obtaining additional financing for further product development or strategic acquisitions  such inability may adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our business plan and may put us at a competitive disadvantage 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions but we believe that any variation in results would not have a material effect on our financial condition 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f revenue recognition electronic transaction processing fee and monthly service revenues are recorded in the period the service is rendered 
certain transaction revenues generated from our resellers  vendors and gateway partners are subject to revenue sharing and rebate arrangements and are recorded as gross revenues 
revenue from certain up front development and connectivity fees is amortized ratably over the expected life of the customer 
revenue from hardware leases  software rentals and maintenance fees is recognized ratably over the applicable period 
revenue from sales of software  software licenses  computer hardware and manufactured goods is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
the same criteria are applied to each element of multiple element arrangements after allocating the amounts paid to individual elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
because we rely primarily on customer purchase orders in our lab communication solutions business  revenues may fluctuate from period to period compared to revenues generated in our electronic healthcare transaction business which is primarily based on recurring revenue streams 
goodwill goodwill is generated from the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair market value of its identifiable assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
see new accounting pronouncements below  goodwill will no longer be amortized  but instead be subject to periodic impairment tests

in the first quarter of and we will no longer record approximately  of amortization relating to our existing goodwill each quarter  which would have been recorded through the first quarter of sfas no 
also requires that goodwill be tested at least annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
we will complete that first step of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of our fiscal year 
we do not anticipate recording an impairment charge as a result of applying sfas no 
during the first quarter of capitalized software development and research and development costs incurred internally and fees paid to outside contractors and consultants in the development of our externally and internally used software products are expensed as incurred as research and development expenses which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses until reaching technological feasibility 
at that time  any future costs are properly capitalized and ultimately amortized over the remaining estimated economic life of the product on a product by product basis 
our judgment is used in determining whether costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
we periodically review projected cash flows and other criteria in assessing the impairment of any capitalized software and take impairment charges as needed 
equity transactions over the past two years we have engaged in various equity transactions 
these transactions were first aimed at providing capital to continue to operate and grow our business and then became a critical step aimed at simplifying our capital structure 
these transactions are complex and require the application of various accounting rules and standards that have resulted in significant cash and non cash charges reflected primarily as deemed dividend charges included our net loss applicable to common shareholders 
bad debt estimates we rely on estimates to determine the bad debt expense and the adequacy of the reserve for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates our based on our historical experience and the industry in which we operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required
