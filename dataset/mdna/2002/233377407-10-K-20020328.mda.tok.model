item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general we market our products and services in states to over  customers that are engaged in a variety of industries  many of which may be counter cyclical to each other 
demand for our products generally is subject to changes in the united states economy and economic trends affecting our customers and the industries in which they compete in particular 
certain of these industries  such as the oil and gas industry  are subject to volatility while others  such as the petrochemical industry and the construction industry  are cyclical and materially affected by changes in the economy 
as a result  we may experience changes in demand within particular markets  segments and product categories as changes occur in our customers respective markets 
our growth strategy in the past focused on a combination of acquisitions  such as the acquisition of the electrical contractor segment  and internal growth 
we have curtailed our acquisition efforts and are focusing on internal growth 
key elements of our internal growth strategy include leveraging existing customer relationships  expanding product offerings to new and existing customers  reducing costs through consolidated purchasing programs and centralized product distribution centers  centralizing certain customer service and inside sales functions  reducing costs by converting selected branches from full warehouse and customer service operations to sales centers  designing and implementing innovative solutions to address the procurement and supply needs of our customers and using our traditional distribution and integrated supply capabilities to increase sales in each area 
results will be dependent on our success in executing our internal growth strategy and  to the extent we complete any acquisitions  our ability to integrate such acquisitions 
results of operations year ended december  in millions  except percentages sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative non recurring operating charges operating income loss interest expense other income income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales for decreased million  or  to approximately million from million in sales for the mro segment decreased million  or primarily due to slowing of the overall economy 
sales for the electrical contractor segment decreased by million  or  when compared to this decrease is the result of the sale  during august  of the majority of the assets of a business in san antonio  texas  which accounted for approximately two thirds of the sales of the electrical contractor segment  combined with a slow down in the construction business for electrical contractors 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was for  up from for gross profit as a percentage of sales for the mro segment increased to for  up from in this increase can be primarily attributed to increased margins in fluid handling equipment sold by the mro segment 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for the electrical contractor segment decreased to for  down from for the comparable period of this decline resulted from lower margin sales associated with a slowdown in the construction business for electrical contractors 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for declined million  or  to approximately million from million in as a percentage of revenue  the expense declined to from for this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced payroll and payroll related expenses 
operating income 
excluding the million of non recurring operating charges recorded in the fourth quarter of  operating income for increased million  million for the electrical contractor segment and million for the mro segment  to million when compared to million for this improved operating income for the mro segment is primarily the result of reduced selling  general and administrative expenses 
the operating loss for the electrical contractor segment decreased to million for  from million for  excluding the million of non recurring charges in the reduced operating loss for the electrical contractor segment results from the sale during august of the majority of the assets of a business which was not profitable 
interest expense 
interest expense for decreased by million to million from million for this decline results from lower interest rates  a lower average debt balance for when compared to and suspension of recording interest on the million subordinated note 
other income 
other income was approximately million lower in than in due primarily to million of gains on the sale of two warehouse facilities during income taxes 
as of december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets of million representing the future tax benefits of certain accruals not currently deductible 
we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income 
for information concerning the provision for current and deferred income taxes as well as information regarding differences between the effective tax rates and statutory rates  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net income 
excluding the non recurring charges and the gains on the sale of two warehouse facilities in  net income increased by approximately million in from a loss of approximately million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
revenues for decreased to approximately million from million in the valve segment  which was sold during the third quarter of  generated revenues in of million 
excluding these revenues  current year revenues actually increased by million when compared to sales for the mro segment increased million  or  primarily due to an improvement in the oil and gas industry 
sales for the electrical contractor segment declined by million  or  as a result of employee turnover and continued loss of market share to competitors 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales declined by approximately for when compared to  both on a consolidated basis and for the mro segment 
the majority of this decline occurred at a one location operation  which was acquired prior to this operation serves primarily one customer 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for the electrical contractor segment remained relatively constant for  when compared to  as the segment maintained gross margin but lost market share 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for declined by approximately million when compared to as a percentage of revenue  the expense declined by approximately to from for non recurring operating charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of non recurring operating charges 
these charges consist of an million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other assets associated with acquisitions completed before  a million charge to write off fixed assets of computer systems which are being replaced and facilities which have been closed  and million of accruals primarily associated with future rent on closed facilities 
approximately million and million of this charge pertained to the electrical contractor segment and mro segment  respectively 
as a result of increasingly poor financial results for the acquired operations  we evaluated our recoverability of goodwill and other assets recorded in connection with all of our acquisitions 
all of our acquisitions were completed prior to these operations have been experiencing declining revenues and declining operating margins 
we determined that the expected future undiscounted cash flows of four acquisitions were below their carrying value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  during the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of approximately million 
operating income 
excluding the million of nonrecurring operating charges  operating income for increased million when compared to this increase is the net of a million increase in operating income for the mro segment  a million increase in operating loss for the electrical contractor segment and a million decline in operating income resulting from the sale of the valve segment 
the improved operating income  exclusive of nonrecurring charges  for the mro segment is the result of increased sales and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increased loss for the electrical contractors segment is the result of the continued loss of market share and a decrease in sales 
interest expense 
interest expense for remained constant when compared to although our average outstanding debt balance between the two years was lower in compared to  the increased interest rates we paid as a result of amending the credit facility combined with the market increase in interest rates resulted in interest expense remaining relatively constant 
other income 
other income for was approximately million higher than in due primarily to the sale of two mro facilities during for approximately million 
gains on the sale of these properties were approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources general as a distributor of mro products and electrical contractor products  we require significant amounts of working capital to fund inventories and accounts receivable 
additional cash is required for capital items such as information technology and warehouse equipment 
we also require cash to pay our lease obligations and to service our debt 
under the credit facility  all available cash is generally applied to reduce outstanding borrowings  with operations funded through borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit facility consists of three secured lines of credit and a term loan with various of our subsidiaries 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement associated with the acquisition of a business in  we can require the seller to adjust the purchase price for certain inventory remaining unsold as of july  we notified the seller that the adjustment of the purchase price exceeds the million balance of the subordinated note payable we issued as part of the purchase price 
as of july   we suspended principal and interest payments on the note 
the seller has notified our bank lender that we were in default on the subordinated note 
our bank lender notified us that the default on the subordinated note caused us to be in default on one of our secured lines of credit that had an outstanding balance of million at december  our bank lender agreed to forebear taking any action on defaults under the associated million secured line of credit 
the bank lender may terminate the forbearance at any time 
the million outstanding balance of the secured line of credit and the million balance of the subordinated note have been included in current maturities of long term debt at december  in our opinion  should payment of the million balance outstanding under the million secured line of credit be demanded  we would be able to refinance the obligation or repay it through the proceeds from asset sales or property refinancing 
during january   we filed suit against the seller to collect the purchase price adjustment 
in february   the seller filed a counterclaim against us to collect the balance of the subordinated note and accrued interest 
we attended a court mandated mediation meeting during the fourth quarter of without resolution 
we intend to aggressively pursue our claims against the seller under the provisions of the asset purchase agreement 
the subordinated note provides for an interest rate of prime plus four percent if the note is in default 
we did not accrue any interest on the subordinated note during we believe the subordinated note will either be repaid using funds obtained from the seller in settlement of our claims or will be offset against our claims 
we are negotiating with the seller to resolve this litigation  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in collecting the funds due under our claims against the seller or in offsetting the subordinated note against our claims 
we amended the credit facility with our bank lender effective august  the credit facility now provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of the lesser of i a percentage of the collateral value based on a formula set forth therein or ii million  and matures april   except for the million secured line of credit which is in default and may be accelerated anytime as discussed above 
interest accrues at prime plus on approximately million of the credit facility  prime plus on the million line of credit which is in default  and prime plus on the term portion of the credit facility 
the prime rate at december   was 
the credit facility is secured by receivables  inventory  real estate and machinery and equipment 
the credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as financial covenants that are measured monthly and require that we maintain a certain cash flow and other financial ratios 
from time to time we have not been in compliance with certain covenants under the credit facility  including the monthly minimum earnings requirement and the monthly fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
all past violations of the covenants have been waived 
although we expect to be able to comply with the covenants of the credit facility  there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to do so or that our lender will be willing to waive such non compliance or further amend such covenants 
in addition to the million of cash at december   we had million available for borrowings under the amended credit facility at december  we generated cash in operating activities of approximately million in as compared to million in cash used during this change between the two years is primarily attributable to accounts receivable declining in  thus providing cash versus accounts receivable increasing in  thus using cash 
we generated cash through investing activities of approximately million during as compared to approximately million in cash generated in this decrease is primarily attributable to the sales of two warehouse properties in  for approximately million in cash 
in we sold certain assets of the electrical contractor segment for million in cash 
we also had capital expenditures of approximately million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million during capital expenditures during were related primarily to leasehold improvements associated with the relocation of two of our mro facilities million  computer equipment and the development of an e commerce website million which was subsequently written off 
capital expenditures during were primarily related to computer software and computer equipment 
our internal cash flow projections indicate our cash generated from operations and available under our credit facility will meet our normal working capital needs during however  we will require additional debt or equity financing to meet our future debt service obligations  which may include additional bank debt or the public or private sale of equity or debt securities 
in connection with such financing  we may be required to issue securities that substantially dilute the interest of our shareholders 
as described above  all of our credit facility matures on or before april  we will need to extend the maturity of  or replace our credit facility on or before april  however  we may not be able to renew and extend or replace the credit facility 
any extended or replacement facility may have higher interest costs  less borrowing capacity  more restrictive conditions and could involve equity dilution 
our ability to obtain a satisfactory credit facility may depend  in part  upon the level of our asset base for collateral purposes  our future financial performance and our ability to obtain additional equity 
we would require additional capital to fund any future acquisitions 
at this time  we do not plan to grow through acquisitions unless the market price of our common stock rises to levels that will make acquisitions accretive to our earnings or we generate excess cash flow 
we also may pursue additional equity or debt financing to fund future acquisitions  although we may not be able to obtain additional financing on attractive terms 
discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant estimates made by us in the accompanying financial statements relate to reserves for accounts receivable collectibility  inventory valuations and self insured medical claims 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and require management s subjective or complex judgments 
below is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies 
also  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when an agreement is in place  price is fixed  title for product passes to the customer or services have been provided  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
assurance for doubtful accounts provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made monthly and adjustments are made periodically as circumstances warrant based upon the expected collectibility of all such accounts 
inventory inventory consists principally of finished goods and is priced at lower of cost or market  cost being determined using both the first in  first out fifo and the last in  first out lifo method 
reserves are provided against inventory for estimated obsolescence based upon the aging of the inventory and market trends 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities sfas no 

this statement requires the fair value of derivatives be recorded as assets or liabilities 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives would be accounted for currently in earnings or comprehensive income depending on the purpose of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
sfas no 
 as amended  was effective for us beginning january  we adopted the statement effective january   there was no impact on our financial results as we were not a party to any derivative instruments 
in  the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached a consensus on issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs and issue  accounting for certain sales incentives  collectively  the issues 
we adopted the issues in the fourth quarter of and have restated our quarterly and annual financial statements to conform to the requirements of the issues 
there was no effect on net income as a result of the adoption of the issues 
the net effect of the adoption of the issues was an increase in net sales of million and million  an increase in cost of sales of million and million  a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million and million  and a decrease in other income of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations was issued 
sfas no 
eliminates the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and establishes the purchase method as the only acceptable method 
the statement was effective beginning june  management has reviewed the requirements of the statement and does not believe it will have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
in june  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets was issued 
sfas no 
changes the treatment of goodwill by no longer amortizing goodwill  and instead requiring  at least annually  an assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
however  other identifiable intangible assets with determinable lives are to be separately recognized and amortized 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the statement will result in the elimination of approximately  of goodwill amortization  annually  subsequent to december  the new requirements for assessing whether goodwill assets have been impaired involve market based information 
based on a preliminary review of the new standards  we believe that we will record a noncash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the first quarter of when the new standard becomes effective 
this charge will be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
