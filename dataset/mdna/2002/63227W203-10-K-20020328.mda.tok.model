item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we offer products and services as either integrated systems or individual components primarily through three business lines traditional production equipment and services  through which we provide standardized components  replacement parts and used components and equipment servicing  engineered systems  through which we provide customized  large scale integrated oil and gas production systems  and automation and control systems  through which we provide control panels and systems that monitor and control oil and gas production 
we report three separate business segments north american operations  engineered systems and automation and control systems 
in january  we completed our initial public offering of common stock  resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock with net proceeds of million 
in july  we changed our presentation of certain assets that were acquired from the cynara company in november  and the related operating results  for segment reporting purposes 
the majority of the assets were reclassified to the north american operations business segment from the engineered systems business segment 
this change has been retroactively reflected in all periods presented

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures advising interested parties of the factors that affect us  including  without limitation  the disclosures made under the caption risk factors and the other factors and risks discussed in this annual report on form k and in subsequent reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions which affect the results reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following accounting policy is the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenues from significant contracts contracts greater than  and longer than four months in duration and all automation and controls contracts and orders on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
earned revenue is based on the percentage that costs incurred to date relate to total estimated costs of the project  after giving effect to the most recent estimates of total cost 
the timing of costs incurred  and therefore when revenues are recognized  could be affected by various internal or external factors including changes in project scope change orders  changes in productivity  the cost or scarcity of labor and equipment  governmental regulations  the political environment  weather patterns or the timing of client acceptances and approval at benchmark stages of the project 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the year in which these changes become known 
earned revenue reflects the original contract price adjusted for agreed claims and change order revenues  if applicable 
losses expected to be incurred on the jobs in progress  after consideration of estimated minimum recoveries from claims and change orders  are charged to income as soon as such losses are known 
customers typically retain an interest in uncompleted projects  and we generally recognize revenue and earnings to which the percentage of completion method applies over a period of two to six quarters 
we believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a term of several years to evaluate our performance under long term contracts  after all change orders  scope changes and cost recoveries have been negotiated and realized 
we record revenues and profits on all other sales as shipments are made or services are performed 
acquisitions in november  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of the cynara company cynara  a designer and manufacturer of specialized production equipment utilizing membrane technology to separate bulk carbon dioxide from natural gas streams  for approximately million   shares of our common stock and the right to receive additional shares of common stock based upon the financial performance of the cynara assets 
ultimately  we issued  additional shares 
in january  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of porta test international  inc porta test  a manufacturer of centrifugal devices used to enhance the effectiveness of separation equipment  for approximately million and the right to receive additional payments based upon the performance of certain porta test assets 
see commitments and contingencies 
in february  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of modular production equipment  inc mpe  a designer and manufacturer of water treatment separation systems specializing in hydrocyclone technology  for approximately million 
in april  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of engineering specialties inc esi  a provider of proprietary technologies for oily water treatment and heavy metals removal from production at or near the wellhead  for approximately million 
on march   we acquired all the outstanding share capital of axsia  a privately held process and design company based in the united kingdom  for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
axsia specializes in the design and supply of water re injection systems for oil and gas fields  oily water treatment  oil separation  hydrocyclone technology  hydrogen production and other process equipment systems 
this acquisition was financed with borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facility 
we accounted for each of the above transactions using the purchase method of accounting 
industry and business environment as a leading provider of wellhead process equipment  systems and services used in the production of oil and gas  our revenues and results of operations are closely tied to demand for oil and gas products and spending by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
these companies generally invest more in exploration and development efforts during periods of favorable oil and gas commodity prices  and invest less during periods of unfavorable oil and gas prices 
as supply and demand change  commodity prices fluctuate producing cyclical trends in the industry 
during periods of slow down  revenues for service providers such as natco generally decline  as existing projects are completed and new projects are postponed 
during periods of recovery  revenues for service providers can lag behind the industry due to the timing of new project awards 
over the past several years  our business has been impacted by fluctuations in the oil and gas industry in the united states and canada 
in and throughout  the industry suffered the effects of a significant decline in expenditures due to a sharp decline in hydrocarbon prices 
in  energy prices rose significantly and the industry began a recovery 
in  energy prices declined again in part as a response to higher prices in  and in part due to a general economic slow down in the united states 
as a consequence of this volatility in energy prices  our business has been affected by several cycles of spending by oil and gas companies over the past few years 
the following table summarizes the price of domestic crude oil per barrel and the wellhead price of natural gas per thousand cubic feet mcf  as published by the us department of energy  and the number of rotary drilling rigs in operation  as published by baker hughes incorporated  for the most recent five years year ended december  average price of crude oil per barrel in the us us average wellhead price of natural gas per mcf in the us us average us rig us  at december   the price of oil was per barrel  the price of gas had fallen to per mcf  and the us rig count was it is generally expected that spending for exploration and development efforts in the oil and gas industry will continue to trend downward for some time in from a longer term perspective  the us department of energy estimates that world wide demand for petroleum products will grow at an average annual rate of through and that demand for natural gas will increase at an average annual rate of through as demand continues to grow  and reserves in the united states decline  producers and service providers in the oil and gas industry rely more heavily on global sources of energy and expansion into new markets 
furthermore  the industry continues to seek more innovative and technologically efficient means to extract hydrocarbons from existing fields 
due to depletion and the reworking of existing fields  production profiles are changing  including the mix of oil and gas produced by a field  and the use of enhanced recovery techniques in many fields can result in higher levels of contaminants such as water and carbon dioxide 
as a result  additional and more complex equipment may be required to produce oil and gas from these fields 
in addition  many new oil and gas fields produce lower quality or contaminated hydrocarbon streams that require more complex production equipment 
these trends increase the demand for our products and technology

this pronouncement becomes effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not yet determined the impact that this pronouncement will have on our financial condition or results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are conducted around the world in a number of different countries 
accordingly  our earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions relate to operations in canada and the uk at natco canada  most contracts are denominated in canadian dollars  and most of the costs incurred are in canadian dollars  thereby mitigating risks associated with currency fluctuations 
at axsia  which is our uk based operation acquired in march  many contracts are denominated in us dollars  and occasionally in euros  whereas most of the costs may be in british pounds sterling 
consequently  we have some currency risk in our uk operations 
prior to the date of acquisition  axsia had entered into certain forward contract arrangements whereby it sold us dollars for future delivery at a specified strike price  in order to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations on contracts denominated in us dollars 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we paid approximately  to terminate these forward contracts 
no forward contracts or other derivative arrangements existed at december   and we do not currently intend to enter into new forward contracts or other derivative arrangements as part of our currency risk management strategy 
our financial instruments are subject to changes in interest rates  including our revolving credit and term loan facility and our working capital facility for export sales 
at december   we had million outstanding under the term loan portion of the revolving credit and term loan facility 
at december   outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement totaled million 
borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear interest at floating rates 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate of borrowings under the revolving credit and term loan facility was 
borrowings outstanding under the export sales credit facility were million at december   and bore interest at 
based on past market movements and possible near term market movements  we do not believe that potential near term losses in future earnings  fair values or cash flows from changes in interest rates are likely to be material 
assuming our current level of borrowings  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates under the borrowings would decrease our current year net income and cash flow from operations by less than  this calculation assumes no action on our part to mitigate our exposure 
furthermore  this calculation does not consider the effects of a possible change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
