item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general granite is one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states and is engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airports  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
the company has offices in california  texas  georgia  nevada  arizona  florida  new york and utah 
the company s contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies  and private parties and to a lesser extent through negotiation with private parties 
the company s bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts to the company may vary significantly from period to period 
the company s compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
thus  the company may experience an increase in general and administrative expenses in a very profitable year and a decrease in less profitable years 
certain profit sharing amounts are at the discretion of the board of directors based on the company reaching certain levels of profitability each year 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include the recognition of revenue and earnings from construction contracts  accounting for construction joint ventures  the valuation of long term assets and the estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities 
management evaluates all of its estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
revenue recognition the company uses the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures are recognized on the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
provisions are recognized in the statement of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related earnings are not recognized until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
it is the company s judgment that until a project reaches completion  there is insufficient information to determine with a reasonable level of assurance what the estimated profit on the project will be 
factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract profitability include  without limitation  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project  the availability and proximity of materials  the accuracy of the original bid  inclement weather and timing and coordination issues inherent in all projects  including design build 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
the threshold is applied to all percentage of completion projects without exception unless and until the company projects a loss on the project  in which case the estimated loss is immediately recognized 
claims for additional contract revenue are recognized if it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
revenue from contract change orders is recognized when the owner has agreed to the change order 
the foregoing as well as weather  stage of completion and mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts that are fixed unit price under which the company is committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete or cubic yards of earth excavated 
other contracts  including most design build contracts  are priced on a lump sum basis under which the company bears the risk that it may not be able to perform all the work for the specified amount 
all federal government contracts and many of the company s other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the party contracting with the company  with provisions to pay the company for work performed through the date of termination 
construction joint ventures as described under note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company participates in various construction joint venture partnerships 
generally  each construction joint venture is formed to accomplish a specific project  is jointly controlled by the joint venture partners and is dissolved upon completion of the project 
the company selects its joint venture partners based on its analysis of the prospective venturer s construction and financial capabilities  expertise in the type of work to be performed and past working relationships with the company  among other criteria 
the joint venture agreements typically provide that the interests of the company in any profits and assets  and its respective share in any losses and liabilities that may result from the performance of the contract are limited to the company s stated percentage interest in the project 
the venture s contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability  however  the company s agreements with its joint venture partners provide that each party will assume and pay its full proportionate share of any losses resulting from a project 
consistent with industry practice  the company accounts for its share of the operations of these jointly controlled ventures on a pro rata basis in the consolidated statements of income and as a single line item in the consolidated balance sheets 
if we were to account for these interests using a one line item equity method presentation in the consolidated statements of income  revenue and contract costs would be materially lower  however  net income would not change 
alternatively  if we were to account for these interests using full consolidation  assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet would be materially higher and revenue and contract costs in the consolidated statements of income would be materially higher  however  net income would not change 
valuation of long term assets long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management and this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
additionally  the company had approximately million in goodwill at december   which must be reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
the company is required to complete its initial impairment review for its goodwill in the first half of and management does not expect to record an impairment charge 
the impairment testing required by sfas requires considerable judgment and there can be no assurance that an impairment charge will not be required in the future 
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities the company grants credit to customers that include general contractors  property owners and developers  governmental agencies and other companies in a variety of industries 
although the company generally does not require collateral  the law provides the company with the ability to file mechanics liens on real property improved for private customers in the event of non payment 
the company is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and the general economy 
management analyzes specific customer accounts receivable including the age of specific accounts  customer payment history and general economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
additionally  certain accrued liabilities  including insurance reserves  are estimates that rely on an analysis of past trends and the exercise of significant management judgment 
there can be no assurance that the actual amounts of the company s valuation allowances and estimated accrued liabilities will not change as better information becomes available and these changes could be significant 
current year revenue and backlog 
the following is a breakdown of revenue for the years ended december   and in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent revenue by division branch division    heavy construction division    revenue by geographic area california    west excluding california    midwest   south and east    revenue by market sector federal agencies    state agencies    local public agencies    total public sector    private sector    material sales    total revenue in increased to  million from  million in  which reflects increases in both divisions 
branch division revenue increased in due to increases in public sector revenue and revenue from material sales which were partially offset by a decrease in private sector revenue 
the increased revenue from material sales was due to both higher sales volume and generally higher unit prices 
the higher volume was largely due to increases in construction activity near certain of our plant locations 
hcd revenue increased in due primarily to revenue generated from contracts added to backlog in late through mid and revenue contributed by hcd s new granite halmar location in new york of approximately million 
on a market sector basis  revenue from private sector contracts decreased million to million or of total revenue in  from million or of total revenue in the company s private sector work is primarily comprised of site preparation for both commercial and residential developments and privately funded transportation projects 
although the private construction market remains strong in many of the areas that the company works  the company remains cautious about the effect of the general economic slowdown on private sector work in see outlook 
the company s revenue from public sector contracts increased to  million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the level of funding for public sector projects remained strong through in most of the company s geographic markets 
the following is a breakdown of backlog as of december  and in thousands amount percent amount percent backlog by division branch division   heavy construction division   backlog by geographic area california   west excluding california   midwest   south and east   backlog by market sector federal agencies   state agencies   local public agencies   total public sector   private sector   the company s backlog at december  was  million  up million  or from december  the increase in backlog is primarily attributable to hcd as a result of backlog obtained as a result of the halmar acquisition as well as awards in the latter half of which included the company s share of a subway reconstruction project in new york  the company s million share of a design build rail reconstruction project in florida and a million highway project in north carolina 
management believes that approximately of the work in the backlog at december  will be recognized as revenue during year ended gross profit in thousands total gross profit    of revenue for the year ended december   gross profit was million  a million decrease from as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased in to from in the decreased gross profit margin reflected decreases in hcd that were partially offset by slightly increased profit margins in the branch division 
contributing to the decline in the hcd profit margin was a reduction in forecasted profitability of a non sponsored joint venture project on the east coast  a generally less profitable mix of hcd projects compared to a year ago and a higher level of revenue recognized for projects less than complete 
year to date revenue recognized for projects less than complete was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
as described under critical accounting policies above  the company recognizes revenue only to the extent of cost incurred until a project reaches complete 
the reduction in forecasted profitability of an east coast joint venture project partially related to the acceleration of work to complete the project on time to avoid paying liquidated damages 
the company recorded a pretax loss of approximately million for its portion of the expected reduced profitability of the project in the year ended december  cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
although the composition of costs varies with each contract  the company s gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by changes in any one of these costs during the company did experience upward pressure on costs associated with natural gas  fuel and asphalt prices early in  but these had substantially reversed by the end of the year and the company s gross profit margins were not materially impacted by these changes 
general and administrative expenses 
for the years ended december   and general and administrative expenses comprised the following in thousands in thousands salaries and related expenses    incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and pension    other general and administrative expenses    total    percent of revenue salaries and related expenses increased in over due primarily to increased staffing to support the company s current and expected growth including staff supporting the company s new granite halmar location in new york 
incentive compensation and discretionary profit sharing and pension costs decreased in compared to primarily as a function of the company s decreased profitability and the absence of additional expense recognized in related to the impact of certain members of company management reaching age other general and administrative expenses include various costs to support the company s operations  none of which exceeded of total general and administrative expenses 
the increase in other general and administrative expenses in primarily reflects the increases in facilities  information technology support  pre bidding and other costs to support the company s growth 
operating income 
for the years ended december   and operating income was as follows in thousands branch division    hcd    unallocated other corporate expenses    total    hcd s contribution to operating income in decreased over the contribution due to the decreased gross profit margin as described in gross profit above 
additionally  hcd s general and administrative expenses increased during to support the higher level of revenue and backlog as well as increased costs to support a high level of bidding activity during the year 
the branch division s contribution to operating income in increased compared to due primarily to increases in gross profit margin related to materials sales during the year 
other income expense 
other income increased by million to million in from million in the increase is attributable to gains recognized on the sale of excess and developed property of approximately million and higher equity in earnings recognized from the company s investments in tic and wilder 
although the company had higher levels of cash equivalents and other investments during  the effect of declining interest rates left interest income relatively flat as compared to provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was in and in the decrease reflected the absence of additional tax expense recognized in related to the company reaching an agreement with tic to divest its investment over a three and one half year period 
outlook our company is entering with a large backlog of work 
as we begin to anticipate how the year ahead will unfold  we are closely monitoring a number of economic and political issues that may have an impact on our business this year 
on march th  california voters approved proposition a state constitutional amendment that permanently transfers the sales tax on gasoline from the general fund to the state transportation fund 
proposition requires that beginning july   all gasoline sales taxes will be earmarked for transportation improvements  adding a projected to billion annually to california s transportation budget 
starting in fiscal year  proposition would require that the state s share of gasoline sales taxes be used for projects designated under governor davis traffic congestion relief plan 
starting in  revenue would be allocated by the following formula percent would go to major highway and transit construction projects around the state  percent would go to cities and counties for street and highway maintenance  rehabilitation and reconstruction  and storm damage repair  and percent for public transit 
california is granite s largest market  accounting for of total revenues in another current issue is the proposed billion decrease in the fiscal year federal transportation budget  proposed by president bush in february of this year 
this figure includes a billion shortfall from the financing adjustment formula created in the transportation act for the st century tea 
this adjustment is known as the revenue aligned budget authority  or raba 
total appropriations  as determined by congress and tea for fiscal year were billion 
this projected decline in spending relates to the economic slowdown  as fiscal user taxes were significantly lower than expected 
in addition  fiscal year gas tax receipts are forecast to be lower than the baseline amounts guaranteed under tea to help resolve this issue  an agreement was reached in mid march between house of representatives budget and transportation leaders that would work toward raising the funding level for federal highways from the president s budget amount of billion to billion  the level stipulated under the tea authorization 
the company believes that significant political support for highway spending coupled with approximately billion of unobligated funds in the highway trust fund will result in funding levels at least on a par with the authorization of billion 
it is also important to note that although federal funding for could be less than was anticipated  the overall funding amounts under tea remain at record levels 
moreover  while federal funds do make up about of us highway spending  state and local funding represents the balance of the equation 
while a few states have cut back on transportation funding  many of the larger states  such as california and florida  continue to have strong transportation funding programs 
this is because in those states  gasoline taxes  registration fees and other related revenues are dedicated exclusively to transportation  and do not compete with other state discretionary programs 
florida  for example  has instituted mobility  a long term program that provides billion in additional spending over a year period 
texas also recently passed proposition  which created the texas mobility fund a revolving fund to finance highway construction and allow bonds to be sold to help finance transportation projects throughout the state 
texas has traditionally followed a pay as you go approach to fund highways and other transportation projects with the exception of toll roads where the bonds are repaid from toll collections 
looking ahead  it is unclear at this point what impact the current economic marketplace will have on our branch division 
with branches located in california  arizona  nevada and utah  we are witnessing very different economic conditions in each of these states  and regions  in which we operate 
although granite has begun to see some reduction in private sector work being put out to bid  some of our branches are expecting a strong private sector recovery in late and beyond 
as we have witnessed in the past  a slow down in the private sector economy tends to lead to a slow down in the private sector marketplace 
when this happens  granite s competitors in the private sector will typically shift over into the public sector bidding environment  thereby increasing competition and placing downward pressure on margins 
although it appears that the economy in the west is beginning to recover  the branch division is anticipating a reduction in revenue growth in  however  this decline may be more than offset by a very strong year for hcd 
hcd is witnessing a consistent stream of new large projects coming out to bid in both highway and transit construction 
they are targeting bidding opportunities from coast to coast  totaling more than billion over the next months excluding the approximately billion in projects that our granite halmar office in new york is targeting throughout that state 
the division is currently bidding on approximately large projects with an increasing number being design build projects 
as we have mentioned before  it is our opinion that granite s experience in the design build area provides us with a significant advantage over some of our competitors 
in  design build projects made up approximately of hcd s year end backlog 
going forward  we are excited about the opportunities to grow the business in  given the strength of our backlog and the substantial bidding opportunities ahead 
we will continue to move forward on our strategy to grow the company both internally and through acquisitions and to improve our financial performance in both divisions 
prior years revenue and backlog 
total revenue in increased to  million from  million in  which reflects a modest increase in revenue from the branch division partially offset by a decrease in hcd revenue 
the hcd revenue decrease resulted from a lack of new awards during the period from late through mid although hcd did receive significant new awards in late  they were booked too late in the year to make a significant contribution to year revenue 
on a market sector basis  revenue from private sector contracts increased million to million or of total revenue in  from million or of total revenue in the company s private sector work is primarily comprised of site preparation for both commercial and residential developments and privately funded transportation projects 
the company s revenue from public sector contracts decreased slightly to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the level of funding for public sector projects remained strong through in most of the company s geographic markets 
the company s backlog at december  was  million  up million  or from the increase in backlog was due primarily to multiple hcd awards in the latter part of  which included the las vegas monorail project in nevada  the company s portion of the hiawatha light rail joint venture in minnesota and a major bridge and interchange project in florida 
gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit reached million  an million increase from as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased in to from in the increased gross profit margin reflected increases in both branch division and hcd and was a result of favorable market conditions in both the public and private sectors and the overall successful execution of projects 
year to date revenue recognized for projects less than complete was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
as described under critical accounting policies above  the company recognizes revenue only to the extent of cost incurred until a project reaches complete 
during  the company s gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by changes in the revenue from projects that were less than complete 
cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  subcontract costs  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
although the composition of costs varies with each contract  the company s gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by changes in any one of these costs during the company did experience upward pressure on costs associated with labor markets and oil prices  however  the company s gross profit margins were not materially impacted by such changes during general and administrative expenses 
salaries and related expenses increased in over due primarily to increased staffing to support the company s current and expected growth 
incentive compensation and discretionary profit sharing and pension costs increased in over as a function of the company s increased profitability and the impact of certain members of company management reaching age  at which time all the restricted stock grants become fully vested 
other general and administrative expenses include various costs to support its operations  none of which exceeds of total general and administrative expenses 
the increase in other general and administrative expenses in primarily reflects the increases in facilities and other costs to support the company s growth 
operating income 
the heavy construction division s contribution to operating income in decreased slightly over the contribution due to a decreased volume of work performed as a result of hcd projects nearing completion 
these hcd projects were replaced by several new awards in the latter half of see revenue and backlog above 
however  these significant new projects were awarded too late in the year to have a significant impact on revenue and operating income in the branch division s contribution to operating income in increased compared to due primarily to increases in construction revenue and gross margins as described in the gross profit section above 
other income expense 
other income increased million to million in the increase was primarily due to higher interest income resulting from the combined factor of higher interest rates and higher invested balances and the absence of the company s share of a loss of approximately million experienced by tic  partially offset by lower gains on the sale of property and equipment 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was in  an increase of from the increase reflects additional tax expense recognized in the first quarter of related to the company reaching an agreement with tic to divest its investment over a three and one half year period 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash and cash equivalents    net cash provided used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    capital expenditures    working capital    during the company generated cash and cash equivalents from operating activities of million  which represented an increase of million over changes in cash from operating activities primarily reflect variations based on the amount and progress of work being performed 
in particular  billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings  net  as of december  increased as compared to december  largely due to cash timing differences on several large projects in the early stages of construction 
cash used by investing activities in increased million from contributing to this increased use of cash was the million net cash used to acquire halmar  increased purchases of property and equipment and increased purchases of short term investments 
the company generated million in cash from financing activities in due to additions to long term debt  which included million received in may under a new senior credit facility with a group of institutional holders 
the borrowing is due in nine equal annual installments beginning in and bears interest at per annum 
the funds from this borrowing will be used for general corporate purposes 
as more fully described in note and note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations outstanding as of december  total thereafter in thousands senior notes payable        other notes payable    operating lease payments        total        additionally  in march the company entered into agreements to purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities and obligations of two materials and construction businesses in california 
the agreements require cash payments of approximately million plus the value of purchased inventory at the time of close  subject to adjustment as provided in the agreements 
both transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company entered into an agreement to purchase common stock of wilder in the agreement provides for the company to increase its ownership in wilder to between and in and to in the ultimate purchase price of additional wilder common shares will be based largely on its financial results 
the company currently estimates that it will pay approximately million for additional wilder common shares in on january  the company announced a quarterly cash dividend of per common share on the company s common stock 
the dividend is payable april  to stockholders of record march  the company has standby letters of credit totaling approximately million outstanding at december   all of which expire during additionally  the company generally is required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security under certain public and private sector contracts 
at december  approximately billion of the company s backlog was bonded and performance bonds totaling approximately billion were outstanding 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  rather  we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed 
the company s ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon its capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and external factors including the capacity of the overall surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of the company s backlog that is currently bonded and their current underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
the company has been bonded by the same surety for more than years and has never been refused a bond 
the inability to obtain surety bonds would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
as described under critical accounting policies above  the company participates in various construction joint venture partnerships 
the venture s contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability  however  the company s agreements with its joint venture partners provide that each party will assume and pay its full proportionate share of any losses resulting from a project 
the company has not experienced any losses resulting from a joint venture partner s unwillingness or inability to perform  however there can be no assurance that the non performance of a joint venture partner will not occur in the future and such non performance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
restrictive covenants under the terms of debt agreements include the maintenance of certain levels of working capital and cash flow 
other covenants prohibit capital expenditures in excess of specified limits and require the maintenance of tangible net worth as defined of approximately million 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  failure to comply with these covenants could cause the amounts due under the debt agreements to become currently payable 
the company expects the principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures  working capital  acquisitions and other investments 
the company has budgeted million for capital expenditures in  which includes amounts for construction equipment  aggregate and asphalt plants  buildings  leasehold improvements and the purchase of land and aggregate reserves 
in addition to its working capital and cash generated from operations  the company currently has access to funds under a million bank revolving line of credit  of which million was available at december  the line of credit expires in june the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and amounts available under its existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  financial commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations through at least the next months
