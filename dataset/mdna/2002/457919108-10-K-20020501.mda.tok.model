item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the trust s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical and involve the most subjective judgments include our estimates and assumptions of future revenue and expenditures used to project cash flows 
future cash flows are used in the valuation calculation of our hotel properties to determine the recoverability or impairment of the carrying amounts if management is required to test the asset for recoverability of carrying value under statement of financial accounting standards no 
our evaluation of future cash flows is based on our historical experience and other factors  including certain economic conditions 
the trust is a real estate investment trust  which owns the sole general partner interest in the partnership 
in order for the trust to qualify as a reit under prior provisions of the code  neither the trust nor the partnership could operate the hotels 
therefore  each of the hotels is leased to  and operated by  the lessee pursuant to a percentage lease 
each percentage lease obligates the lessee to pay rent equal to the greater of a minimum rent or a percentage rent based on the gross revenue of each hotel 
the lessee also holds the franchise agreement for each hotel 
prior to february   the lessee was owned by innsuites innternational  an entity owned by mr 
wirth and his wife 
effective february   however  the lessee became a wholly owned subsidiary of the trust 
see item business acquisition of the lessee by the trust 
the trust s principal source of cash flows is distributions from the partnership 
pursuant to restrictions contained in certain credit agreements  partnership distributions to the trust during fiscal year are limited to an amount equal to per outstanding share of beneficial interest 
absent such restrictions  the partnership s ability to make distributions to the trust are dependent upon lease payments from the lessee pursuant to the percentage leases 
the lessee s ability to make payments to the partnership pursuant to the percentage leases is dependent primarily upon the operations of the hotels 
as a result of the trust s acquisition of the lessee as of february   any profits earned by the lessee in its operation of the hotels may be distributed to the trust 
at january   the trust owned a interest in the hotels through its sole general partner s interest in the partnership 
this change in ownership resulted primarily from the following transactions on march   the trust purchased million additional general partner units in the partnership for million 
this transaction was fully funded by mr 
wirth who provided an unsecured loan to the trust at interest payable annually beginning march  the unpaid principal balance and accrued interest is due on march  on april   the partnership made an unsecured loan to the trust in the amount of million 
annual interest only payments are due on march of each year and are based on a interest rate 
the unpaid principal balance is due at maturity on april  the trust used the proceeds of that loan to purchase million general partner units in the partnership 
the money loaned by the partnership was generated by refinancing the northern phoenix hotel and borrowing an additional million that was secured by a mortgage on that property 
the original mortgage note was restructured to match the terms of the refinanced note  which bears interest at and matures on april  monthly principal and interest payments began on april  as of april   the trust transferred  at historical cost  its interest in the scottsdale property to the partnership approximately million in exchange for million general partner units 
as a result of the aforementioned transactions  the trust increased its ownership interest in the partnership from approximately to approximately as of april  other incremental  less material  transactions have contributed to the increase from to the trust s sole general partner s interest in the partnership at january  the expenses of the trust consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees and depreciation of the hotels 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse the trust for all such expenses 
therefore  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room revpar  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the percentage leases 
adr increased slightly by to in fiscal year from in fiscal occupancy decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal year as a result a slowing economy and the impact of the terrorist attacks of september  on the travel and hospitality industries 
this resulted in a significant decrease in revpar of to in fiscal from in fiscal the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated 
for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data will continue or that occupancy  adr and revpar will not decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions 
results of operations of the trust for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  as of february   the financial statements of the lessee are consolidated with those of the trust 
therefore  all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated including percentage rent revenue for the trust and percentage rent expense for the lessee

for the twelve months ended january   the trust had total revenues of million compared to million for the twelve months ended january   an increase of million

this decrease of million is due primarily to the million loss on impairment recorded in fiscal year and cost cutting measures at the hotels 
expenses incurred in acquiring lessee for the year ended january  relate to the one time assumption of net liabilities of the lessee that were associated with acquiring the lessee 
comparable costs were not incurred in fiscal year loss on impairment of hotel property was million for the twelve months ended january  this loss resulted from the write down for an impairment of the scottsdale hotel property

real estate and personal property taxes  insurance and ground rent on a pro forma basis were million for the twelve months ended january  hotel property depreciation for the twelve months ended january  compared to increased approximately  or  to million from million  respectively 
the increase resulted primarily from a full year of depreciation on the albuquerque property  an increase in capitalized refurbishment costs of approximately million in the current fiscal year  as well as a full year of depreciation on assets capitalized last year  partially offset by the suspension of depreciation on the hotels which were held for sale beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year the trust recognized extraordinary items of  for the twelve months ended january  related to the extinguishments of debt

liquidity and capital resources through its ownership interest in the partnership and  effective february   the lessee  the trust has its proportionate share of the benefits and obligations of the partnership s ownership interests and the lessee s operational interests in the hotels 
the trust s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to its shareholders  is its share of the partnership s cash flow 
the partnership s principal source of revenue is rent payments under the percentage leases 
the lessee s obligations under the percentage leases are unsecured and its ability to make rent payments to the partnership under the percentage leases  and the trust s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to its shareholders  will depend upon the ability of the lessee to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations 
additionally  pursuant to restrictions contained in certain credit agreements  partnership distributions to the trust during fiscal year are limited to an amount equal to per outstanding share of beneficial interest 
as a result of the trust s acquisition of the lessee as of february   any profits earned by the lessee in its operation of the hotels may be distributed to the trust 
see item business acquisition of the lessee by the trust above 
for the twelve months ended january  and  the trust recorded provisions of approximately million and million  respectively  for uncollectible receivables as a component of general and operating expenses 
these charges reflect the trust s assessment of the collectibility of its receivables  which primarily consisted of rent receivable from the lessee  based on an evaluation of the lessee s estimated future cash flows 
as of january   the trust has no commitments for capital expenditures beyond a reserve for refurbishment and replacements set aside annually  as described below 
the trust intends to acquire and develop additional hotels and expects to incur indebtedness to fund those acquisitions and developments 
the trust may also incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on a reit under the code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from the trust s investments are insufficient to make the required distributions

on july   the trust obtained a term loan in the amount  secured by the scottsdale property and a  line of credit secured by the flagstaff property 
the trust used million of the proceeds to settle the remaining balance of the credit facility 
the term loan matured on october  and was extended through november  the line of credit matures on june  both loans bear interest at the prime rate plus and require the trust to maintain a debt coverage ratio of to and the lessee to maintain a gross operating profit of of the annual projections provided to the lender 
as of january   the trust had drawn  on the new line of credit 
as of january   the trust was not in compliance with the covenant on the line of credit and term loan requiring the trust to maintain a debt coverage ratio of not less than to the trust has received a wavier for the period ended january  and the lender has amended the debt coverage ratio to to effective for fiscal year management believes that the trust will be able to comply with the amended debt coverage ratio during fiscal year in addition  management fee payments to the new management company and licensing fee payments to the license corp 
will be suspended for a period of five months beginning may  and may resume after september  pending future compliance with the amended debt coverage ratio  the partnership is restricted from making distributions to the trust during fiscal year in excess of the amount required for the trust to pay dividends of per outstanding share of beneficial interest for fiscal year  and the trust has committed to not spend more than million on capital expenditures during fiscal year see item business introduction to our business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general and liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of such restrictions 
on april   the mortgage note payable to bank one on the tucson st 
mary s property matured 
the outstanding principal balance was  bank one extended the loan  waiving principal and interest payments until december   provided the trust pay million to settle the loan in full on or before december  on december   the trust refinanced its tucson st 
mary s property and used million of the proceeds to fully satisfy the bank one mortgage note  which resulted in an extraordinary gain of  the new mortgage note in the amount of million bears interest at the prime rate plus and matures on february  the mortgage agreement requires the trust to maintain a debt coverage ratio of not less than to as of january   the trust was not in compliance with the debt coverage covenant on this new loan 
the trust has received a wavier of such noncompliance for the period ended january  management believes that the trust will be able to comply with the debt coverage ratio during fiscal year the trust may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by the trust may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as the trust considers prudent 
the trust will acquire or develop additional hotels only as suitable opportunities arise  and the trust will not undertake acquisition or redevelopment of properties unless adequate sources of financing are available 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from borrowings or from the proceeds of additional issuances of shares of beneficial interest or other securities 
however  there can be no assurance that the trust will successfully acquire or develop additional hotels 
in august  the trust listed its scottsdale and flagstaff properties for sale 
since the market value of these properties exceeds the carrying value  the trust does not expect to incur losses if these properties are sold 
the trust may or may not be successful in selling these properties in the listing period 
on august   albuquerque suite hospitality  llc  a owned subsidiary of the partnership  purchased the suite best western airport inn located in albuquerque  new mexico for million 
the funds utilized for the purchase price were secured by a first mortgage on the albuquerque hotel in the amount of  and the remaining amount was loaned by mr 
wirth and his affiliates 
the partnership continues to contribute to a capital expenditures fund the fund  from the rent paid under the percentage leases  an amount equal to of the lessee s revenues from operation of the hotels 
the fund is intended to be used for capital improvements to the hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment  in addition to other uses of amounts in the fund considered appropriate from time to time 
the partnership anticipates making similar arrangements with respect to future hotels that it may acquire or develop 
during the twelve months ended january  and  the hotels spent approximately million and million  respectively  for capital expenditures 
the trust considers the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing 
therefore  these amounts have been capitalized and are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
pursuant to restrictions contained in certain credit agreements  however  the partnership may not spend more than million on capital expenditures during fiscal year the lessee also spent approximately million during both fiscal years and on repairs and maintenance and these amounts have been charged to expense as incurred 
as of october   the trust had commitments for capital expenditures beyond the reserve for refurbishment and replacements set aside annually for each hotel property 
the trust committed an additional  for the refurbishment of its buena park property to satisfy the conditions of the newly acquired best western franchise for that property and committed  over the reserved for the ontario property for new furnishings and refurbishment  which was a condition of the ontario refinance set by the franchisor 
at closing of the ontario refinancing  these funds were escrowed from the proceeds received by the trust 
as of january   these commitments have been substantially satisfied 
in addition  the trust expects to spend million for capital expenditures during fiscal year management believes that cash on hand  future cash receipts from operations  potential sales of certain hotel properties held for sale and borrowings from affiliates in fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the trust s expansion plans and to pay all obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
the trust s projection of future cash receipts includes certain revenue increases and cost cutting measures 
the trust has been adversely affected in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september  the september events 
since the september events  the hotels have experienced significant short term declines in occupancy compared to the prior year 
at present  it is not possible to predict either the severity or duration of such declines in the medium or long term range  or the potential impact on the trust s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
however  as a result of the significant short term declines in occupancy  the trust has taken steps to reduce costs 
the trust has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of its cost structure including  among other things  facilities related costs 
furthermore  the trust has evaluated hotel financial performance subsequent to the september events and its impact on the trust s investments and contingent obligations 
the trust has reviewed potential impairments to investments in hotel management contracts  receivables or other investments due to declines in hotel profitability and reduced management and franchise fees 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years thereafter mortgage notes payable  notes payable to banks  other notes payable and notes and advances payable to related parties operating leases total accounting matters in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement  which supersedes both fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of statement and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in opinion 
statement retains the fundamental provisions of statement regarding the recognition and measurement of impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with statement for example  statement provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
statement retains the basic provisions of opinion regarding the presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike statement  an impairment assessment under statement will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
the trust is required to adopt statement no later than the year beginning after december   and plans to adopt its provisions for the quarter ending april  management does not expect the adoption of statement to have a material impact on the trust s consolidated financial statements at the date of adoption because the impairment assessment under statement is largely unchanged from statement the provisions of statement regarding assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  management cannot determine the potential future effects that adoption of statement will have on the trust s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations statement and statement statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement also specifies the criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement will also require that the estimated residual values of intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  and be reviewed for impairment 
the trust was required to adopt the provisions of statement immediately after its issuance and was required to adopt statement effective february  furthermore  any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre statement accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized in accordance with the appropriate pre statement accounting literature 
statement would require  upon adoption of statement  that the trust evaluate any existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in statement for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of statement  the trust would be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the trust would be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement within the first interim period 
any impairment loss would be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
as of january   the trust has no recorded intangible assets or goodwill arising from a purchase business combination 
management does not expect the adoption of statements and to have a material impact on the trust s consolidated financial statements 
inflation the trust s revenue is based on the underlying hotel revenue 
therefore  the trust relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessee s ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general  and the lessee in particular  can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessee s ability to raise rates faster than inflation 
seasonality the hotels operations historically have been seasonal 
the six southern arizona hotels experience their highest occupancy in the first fiscal quarter and  to a lesser extent  the fourth fiscal quarter 
the second fiscal quarter tends to be the lowest occupancy period at those six southern arizona hotels 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in the trust s quarterly revenue 
the hotels located in northern arizona  california and new mexico historically experience their most profitable periods during the second and third fiscal quarters the summer season  providing some balance to the general seasonality of the trust s hotel business 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  because of temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue  the trust may utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to make distributions to its shareholders or meet operating needs 
no assurance can be given that the trust will make distributions in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its mortgage notes payable  notes payable to banks  other notes payable and notes and advances payable to related parties 
the proceeds from these loans were used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand the trust s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the trust s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the trust borrows using fixed rate debt  when possible 
the trust could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
to date  the trust has not entered into any such derivative transactions 
the trust s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair value and other terms required  by year of expected maturity  in order to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
fiscal debt type thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt interest rate available on january  the fair value of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt were determined based on current rates offered for fixed rate debt and variable rate libor debt with similar risks and maturities 
notes and advances payable to related parties were excluded from the fair value total because it is not practical to estimate the fair value of those borrowings due the uncertainty regarding timing of repayments 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of january  and does not consider those exposures or positions which would arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not represented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the trust s interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and future interest rates
