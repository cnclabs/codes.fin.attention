part i item business ocular sciences  inc  a delaware corporation the company  is a growing manufacturer and global marketer of soft contact lenses 
the company manufactures a broad line of soft contact lenses marketed for annual and quarterly planned replacement and disposable replacement regimens 
the company believes that the design of its lenses makes them more comfortable and easier to handle than those of its competitors and  as a result  provides wearers with a superior contact lens wearing experience 
the company s manufacturing technologies permit consistent  cost effective reproduction of these designs  allowing the company to offer its lenses at competitive prices 
the company continues to focus on lowering its manufacturing and non manufacturing costs  or cost to serve  thus enabling the company to increase its profitability and its flexibility to reduce prices 
to minimize its cost to serve  the company utilizes a telemarketing sales force supplemented by an outside sales force in the north american and european markets  and focuses its marketing efforts on eyecare practitioners  rather than consumers 
the company markets its lenses exclusively to eyecare practitioners  both in private practice and in retail optical chains  as the company believes that the eyecare practitioner significantly influences the selection of the brand of contact lenses patients wear and is critical to maintaining a patient s quality of care and safety 
accordingly  the company does not sell to mail order companies  pharmacies or other distribution channels that do not provide the regular eye examinations necessary to maintain overall ocular health 
the company believes that practitioners can increase patient satisfaction and improve patient care by prescribing and dispensing to their patients high quality  channel specific and competitively priced soft contact brands  such as those made by the company 
as a result  the company s marketing strategies not only focus on its superior product offerings  but are designed to assist eyecare practitioners in retaining their patients and monitoring their patients ocular health 
we believe our strategies create a significant incentive for practitioners to prescribe the company s lenses 
the company introduced lenses marketed for weekly disposable replacement regimens in since their introduction  unit sales of lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens have increased significantly each year and represent the dominant proportion of the company s overall unit sales 
over the same period  the overall average selling price for all of the company s spherical lenses has declined  but has 
table of contents been somewhat offset by lower unit production costs gained through improved manufacturing and packaging processes and by the introduction of higher priced specialty lenses  such as toric lenses for astigmatism 
annual revenues continue to increase year to year  primarily as a result of the company s international sales efforts 
industry overview approximately of the united states population needs some type of vision correction 
an estimated million people in the united states and million people worldwide  wear contact lenses to correct their vision 
while contact lenses have been available for decades  the advent of soft lenses in changed the industry substantially and stimulated significant penetration of the eyeglass market as these new soft lenses provided a dramatically higher level of comfort compared to earlier rigid lenses 
the first soft contact lenses were generally prescribed for replacement every one to two years and required an extensive cleaning routine 
however  even with this cleaning program  these lenses often became progressively less comfortable to wear over time as protein deposits accumulated on the surface of the lenses 
in response to these and other issues  soft contact lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens were introduced in these replacement regimens  which minimized ocular complications stemming from unsanitary contact lenses  spurred a rapid increase in contact lens consumption in the united states 
while contact lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens are often made from the same or similar polymers and can have the same or similar designs as lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens  lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens are generally produced in substantially higher volumes  sold in larger quantities and packaged in less expensive materials 
the company believes these factors allowed the lenses to be sold at significantly reduced unit prices  making more frequent lens replacement economically feasible for the consumer 
the increase in unit sales resulting from more frequent lens replacement increased manufacturing economies of scale which  together with increased competition in distribution channels  led to significant reductions in average retail prices per unit 
as average retail prices decreased  eye care practitioners were more likely to recommend more frequent replacement of contact lenses  thus  reducing the risks associated with less frequent replacement and improper lens care and further increasing lens consumption 
industry data shows that contact lens wearers are also increasingly migrating toward specialty lenses  such as disposable toric lenses  cosmetic lenses  aspheric lenses  multifocals and sports lenses  and toward daily  bi weekly and monthly disposable wear regimes 
the company believes that the united states market for contact lenses will continue to grow  although at a slower rate than it previously had  as wearers continue to shift towards more frequent lens replacement regimens 
in addition  industry data shows that while the united states market for contact lenses is quite mature and has a fairly high level of product penetration  non us markets are relatively under penetrated 
specifically  europe  japan and the rest of the world  as a category  have product penetration rates below the domestic market level 
due to these lower product penetration levels and the continued conversion to disposable soft contact lenses in non us markets as high quality and competitively priced contact lenses become increasingly available in those markets  the company believes that the non us markets for contact lenses have substantial growth potential 
most contact lenses are purchased  in the united states  from optometrists  either in private practice or in retail chains  or from ophthalmologists in private practice  and internationally  from opticians 
most patients select contact lenses based on the recommendation of their eyecare practitioners and because contact lens prescriptions are generally brand specific  patients typically continue to purchase the same brand for their prescription refills 
the typical eyecare practitioner  in both private practice and retail chain channels  depends heavily on sales of products  such as contact lenses and eyeglasses  as a source of revenue 
the company estimates the typical optometric practice or retail optical chain in the united states realizes approximately two thirds of its revenue from sales of corrective products  such as contact lenses and eyeglasses  and approximately one third of its revenue from professional services such as eye examinations 
because the need for vision correction is chronic  repeat sales of contact lenses can provide the practitioner with a recurring  predictable revenue base 

table of contents while the introduction of disposable lens replacement regimens has led to growth in the contact lens market  it has placed additional competitive pressure on practitioners 
traditionally  patients purchased new lenses annually in connection with their eye examinations 
today  however  while the patient may see the practitioner annually to monitor eye health  after the initially fitting of the lenses  the patient may refill the lens prescription three or four or even more times per year through pharmacies or other distribution channels 
the prescribing practitioner risks losing the recurring sales represented by prescription refills because nationally advertised lens brands are available through virtually every possible channel of distribution  including mail order and e commerce companies and pharmacies 
the company believes that practitioners can increase their patient retention as well as provide better ongoing patient care by providing competitively priced  high quality products that are differentiated by brand from those offered by competing distribution channels 
as a result  the company believes there are significant opportunities for manufacturers of contact lenses that can effectively address these needs 
moreover  the company believes that the increased frequency of lens purchases resulting from the shift to ever shorter disposable replacement regimens can provide significant recurring revenues for manufacturers that are able to produce and distribute large quantities of high quality lenses on a cost effective basis 
strategy the company has designed and implemented a six prong business strategy aimed at helping eyecare practitioners  and accordingly the company  succeed in an increasingly competitive market 
the principal elements of the company s strategy include produce superior performing products 
the company believes that its contact lenses are more comfortable and easier to handle than those of its major competitors because its advanced dry cast molding process and sophisticated lens designs increase wearers comfort and improve shape retention of lenses 
in addition  the company s lenses are designed and manufactured to provide superior fitting characteristics over its competitors lenses 
these advantages should enable the company to successfully market its lenses to eyecare practitioners for both existing  as well as new  contact lens wearers 
emphasize low cost  high volume  efficient manufacturing 
with the growth of the high volume disposable market segment  low cost  high volume  scaleable manufacturing has become increasingly important 
the company s dry cast molding technology allows it to manufacture high quality lenses efficiently 
as a result  the company has been able to reduce its per unit production costs while increasing production volumes and product offerings 
the company continues to implement highly automated production lines in its united kingdom and puerto rico manufacturing facilities 
the company believes that the increased unit volumes resulting from the growing disposable replacement market and this continued investment in automation and capacity will enable it to further reduce per unit production costs and increase production volumes 
employ brand segmentation by channel 
unlike its larger competitors  which promote nationally advertised consumer brands across multiple distribution channels  the company advertises and promotes its lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens under specific brand names for the private practice channel and other brand names for the retail chain channel 
the company also provides private label brands for its larger customers 
the company believes that branding by distribution channel creates brand differentiation across channels and allows practitioners to differentiate the lenses they sell from those sold through competing channels  increasing eyecare practitioners ability to retain their patients prescription refill business 
as a result  the company believes its channel specific branding has become increasingly valuable to eyecare practitioners 
minimize cost to serve 
a substantial portion of the company s costs are associated with processing orders and selling and marketing its products 
the company strives to lower these non manufacturing costs  or cost to serve  in order to increase its profitability and its flexibility to reduce prices 
the company s primary methods of minimizing cost to serve are the continued use of telemarketing  supplemented by an outside direct sales organization in the united states and european markets and targeting advertising at practitioners rather than consumers 
the company believes this strategy lowers the cost of an average sales call  as compared to that of its competitors who rely solely on field sales representatives and costly consumer 
table of contents advertising campaigns 
the company s outside sales organization  combined with its inside sales personnel  can make more calls per day at a lower annual cost than field sales representatives alone 
expand internationally 
the company believes that the growth rate of many international markets for soft contact lenses will exceed that of the united states market  driven largely by increased availability of low priced lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens in developed  but under penetrated markets such as europe  japan and canada 
however  many non us markets lack the level of demand necessary for local manufacturers to achieve the economies of scale required for low cost lens production 
as part of its international growth strategy  the company has established strategic distribution and marketing relationships with regional optical companies  such as seiko contactlens  inc seiko in japan  to capitalize on their existing market presence  customer relationships and local infrastructure 
on march   the company entered into an agreement to acquire certain of seiko s assets for approximately million 
as part of the acquisition  the company intends to hire approximately seiko sales and administrative personnel 
the company currently expects transaction to close during the second quarter of on february   the company acquired the contact lens business of essilor international compagnie d optique sa essilor 
the essilor business includes administrative and sales and distribution operations in france  germany  the netherlands  scandinavia  switzerland  the united kingdom  and the united states with manufacturing operations in france  the united kingdom and the united states 
the company believes that the acquisition positions the company to fully capitalize on some of the fastest growing segments of the contact lens industry 
first  the addition of essilor s operations greatly expands the company s existing presence in europe  where the company continues to experience strong demand 
the company now has direct sales channels in both north america and europe  which together with japan  comprise the three major geographic markets for soft contact lenses 
second  the demand for toric lenses and disposable bifocals continues to outpace the rest of the market 
essilor s toric and disposable bifocal lenses  combined with the company s new disposable toric lens gives the company a jump start in the specialty lens markets 
the company has also established distribution relationships with other soft contact lens distributors in a number of other countries throughout the world 
focus marketing on eyecare practitioners 
the company s sales and marketing efforts focus on eyecare practitioners  who the company believes strongly influence the brand of lenses purchased by the patient and are critical to maintaining a patient s quality of care and safety 
the company advertises and promotes its products solely to practitioners and does not sell its lenses to mail order or e commerce companies  pharmacies and other distribution channels that do not provide the eyecare services necessary to confirm lens fit and monitor ocular health 
by bar coding each unit shipped for disposable replacement regimens  the company can identify diversion of its lenses to non eyecare practitioner distribution channels 
the company structures its branding and marketing strategies so that the patient will be more likely to refill prescriptions from the practitioner or retail chain from whom the patient received the initial prescription 
the company believes this system assists eyecare practitioners to retain patient reorders and improves practitioners ability to monitor their patients ongoing ocular health  thereby providing a significant incentive for practitioners to prescribe the company s lenses 
products the company manufactures a broad line of soft contact lenses which it believes provide superior performance over other leading products at competitive prices 
soft contact lens performance is defined primarily by comfort how the lens feels on the eye  handling ease of placement and removal  acuity of vision and physiological response 
these qualities  in turn  are determined primarily by lens design and the manufacturing process 
the company s lenses incorporate sophisticated designs  including extremely thin edges  a lenticulated carrier and a low edge apex  that provide a high level of comfort  enhanced shape retention and ease of handling 
the company s dry cast molding process further improves handling and comfort by consistently and accurately reproducing these designs 
in addition  the company s lenses are designed and manufactured to provide fitting characteristics similar to those of its competitors lenses 
in general  these characteristics enable the practitioner to switch a patient to the company s lenses without extensive refitting 

table of contents the company believes that these fitting characteristics  together with its lenses performance and price  make it easy for practitioners to prescribe the company s lenses to existing  as well as new  contact lens wearers 
the company s contact lenses are made from flexible polymers containing     or water 
the company offers different brands for different replacement regimens  from daily  weekly  monthly  quarterly and annual replacement regimes 
a wearer s replacement regimen is generally based on the recommendation of the patient s eyecare practitioner  who typically prescribes a lens brand targeted to that regimen and who advises the wearer on the appropriate lens care procedures for that regimen 
however  the wearer may actually replace their lenses on a more or less frequent basis 
most of the company s lenses contain a light blue bulk applied visibility tint that enables the wearer to see and handle the lenses more easily  although some of the company s more expensive lenses marketed for annual replacement contain a more expensive  individually applied masked tint that improves handling and is less noticeable in the eye 
in addition  most of the company s lenses marketed in the united states and europe contain an ultraviolet absorber  which was introduced in the united states in with different replacement regimens  the company offers lenses having different design parameters  diameters and base curves to enable practitioners to fit their patients better 
the company s lenses marketed for disposable and annual replacement regimens are generally packaged in different quantities and priced differently 
within different replacement regimens  the company offers daily wear lenses that are to be removed  cleaned and disinfected each night  and extended wear lenses that may be worn continuously  night and day  for up to seven days 
in addition  within each replacement regimen  the company offers lenses with different design parameters  diameters and base curves to enable practitioners to fit their patients better 
disposable replacement regimens lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens accounted for of the company s unit volume in weekly replacement regimens 
the company entered the growing weekly disposable segment of the soft contact lens market with a water content lens in september in the first quarter of the company introduced a water content lens to compete directly with one of the market leaders  acuvue 
the water content lens has a design and water content that permit a high level of oxygen transmissibility and provide increased comfort for overnight wear 
in mid  johnson johnson introduced the acuvue lens which it markets in addition to the acuvue lens  which has a thicker lens intended to improve handling as compared to the acuvue lens 
the company s water content lens now competes with both acuvue products 
the company s water content lenses are marketed for replacement every one to two weeks in the united states and monthly in most of the rest of the world 
the company believes that its water lenses marketed for weekly replacement can provide handling and comfort superior to that provided by acuvue  at a competitive price 
the company believes that its lenses marketed for weekly spherical replacement regimens have demonstrated strong market acceptance  steadily gaining united states market share since their introduction and reaching approximately of total unit sales in the weekly disposable market segment in the united states by the fourth quarter of the company sells its lenses marketed for spherical weekly disposal to independent practitioners under the biomedics and certain other private label brands and to retail chains under the ultraflex brand and private label brands 
the company packages its lenses for weekly replacement in boxes  each containing six identical blister packed lenses 
in  the company introduced the hydrogenics uv  a new lens marketed for weekly replacement regimens  which is sold only to independent practitioners 
the company anticipates this product will further enhance the company s branding strategy by segmenting the distribution channels with dedicated products 
monthly replacement regimens planned replacement lenses 
the company s lenses marketed for monthly replacement regimens are sold under the proactive  edge iii proactive  ultraflex smartchoice and private label brands 
these lenses are marketed for replacement every one to three months 
this replacement regimen provides a lower cost alternative to weekly replacement 
daily replacement regimens 
in  the company introduced a low priced lens marketed for daily replacement in japan and europe 
the product is packaged in boxes of or lenses 
the company believes 
table of contents that there may be substantial demand for the convenience of a lens for single day wear 
certain of the company s competitors  including the vistakon division of johnson johnson johnson johnson  the ciba vision division of novartis ciba and bausch lomb  inc bausch lomb  have introduced  and certain others plan to introduce  lower priced lenses marketed for daily replacement in the united states 
the company has experienced a favorable market response during  especially in japan  for its daily disposable lens 
the company  supported by the development of a new manufacturing process and production facility in the united kingdom  will continue to focus on expansion in this arena 
annual replacement regimens the company is a leading provider of soft lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens in the united states and europe 
lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens accounted for of the company s unit volume in these lenses must be cleaned nightly  with an additional weekly enzymatic cleaning to reduce protein accumulation 
patients generally wear these lenses until they become dirty or uncomfortable usually a year for water products and about nine months for water products 
the company markets its lenses for annual replacement regimens primarily under three brand names  edge iii  ultraflex  hydron and also under private labels 
these product lines include a number of lens designs to allow practitioners to choose the lens that best meets their patients needs 
under both the edge iii and ultraflex brands  the company offers a low priced  daily wear product  a thinner product  a product that is both thinner and larger in diameter and a product that may be utilized as an extended wear lens 
the company packages its lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens in single lens vials or blister packs 
specialty lenses specialty lenses include rgp  disposable toric  cosmetic  aspheric  multifocal  sports and extended wear lenses 
in the united states  sales of specialty lenses accounted for less than of the company s unit volume during toric lenses correct vision for patients with astigmatism  characterized by an irregularly shaped cornea 
through its acquisition of the contact lens business of essilor  the company currently offers lenses marketed for annual and quarterly replacement under the sunsoft brand name primarily in the united states and canada and under the lunelle brand name in other non us markets 
in addition  in the company launched a disposable toric lens marketed for weekly replacement in the united states and canada  and plans to expand that into international markets in multifocal lenses aid patients with presbyopia  or age related vision difficulty  in focusing on near objects 
the company offers bifocal lenses under the echelon and sunsoft brand names in the united states and under the lunelle and rythmic brand names internationally 
the company plans to introduce a multifocal lens marketed for weekly replacement under its biomedics brand name in sales and marketing the company markets and sells its products worldwide 
in order to maintain a low cost to serve  the company primarily used an inside sales force since its inception located in its south san francisco and united kingdom facilities 
in  the company supplemented this sales force with an outside sales force created to target europe and the top markets in the united states 
the inside sales force  which relocated to phoenix  arizona in  relies on telemarketing to sell the company s products to practitioners  both in independent practice and retail chains 
with over  practitioners in the united states  the company believes that this market can be reached effectively and frequently through telemarketing  mailings  trade journals and trade shows  at a relatively low cost 
the company believes that this sales strategy combines telemarketing efficiency with the close in person contact of a field sales representative 
in recruiting both its inside and outside sales personnel  the company seeks well educated candidates who it believes will be capable of both discussing technical information and developing relationships with practitioners 
as part of a continuing effort to ensure the motivation  professionalism and effectiveness of its sales representatives  the company provides each sales representative with substantial training in a program that was developed by the company and has been used since its inception 
this program typically includes two 
table of contents weeks of initial training and at least two hours a week of continuing instruction 
this training emphasizes telemarketing sales techniques  the development of personal relationships with customers and the technical aspects of contact lens fitting and design 
each salesperson is assisted by a computer database that maintains each practitioner s profile  monitors ongoing activities and orders  allows sales personnel to enter information for follow up calls and highlights dates for return calls 
the company also utilizes distributors that resell the company s contact lenses primarily to independent practitioners 
the company believes that by using distributors  it increases the availability of its lenses to many practitioners who prefer to utilize a single source for several brands of lenses and manages the costs involved in numerous small orders 
in addition  the company used advertising targeted to practitioners  such as direct mail and advertisements in professional journals  to generate leads for its inside sales force 
the company also provides customers with merchandising allowances and has developed a variety of promotional programs to offer lenses at significantly reduced prices in order to encourage trial of its products 
as a matter of policy  the company does not sell lenses to mail order and e commerce companies because it is not consistent with the company s strategy of focusing on the practitioner and because such companies do not provide the regular eye examinations necessary to check the fit of the lenses and monitor patients overall ocular health 
to control the distribution of its lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens  the company places serialized bar codes on each disposable product box and blister pack and routinely monitors product availability at these companies 
the company has a policy of terminating the supply of lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens to customers who divert products to this distribution channel 
in the united states  the company sold its products to approximately  independent practitioner accounts and approximately retail chains 
the company s customers in each of the past three years have included the top united states optical retailers 
fifteen of these retailers  as well as key international corporate accounts that have selected the company s lenses for their private label 
the company s ten largest us customers in represented approximately of the company s net sales for the year 
product branding 
the company has developed many different trademarked brands for its lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens 
certain brands are offered only to independent practitioners 
other brands are offered only to retail chains 
in addition  private label brands are offered to certain high volume customers that wish to develop their own brand recognition and loyalty  and private practitioners or groups of private practitioners meeting certain volume criteria can similarly purchase semi exclusive brands that are not widely offered to other practitioners in their local market 
the company believes that this approach differentiates it from its leading competitors  which typically rely heavily on expensive consumer advertising and promotion of national brands to generate brand awareness and demand 
with the same nationally advertised and promoted brands of lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens available through a number of major distribution channels  including mail order  e commerce companies and pharmacies  patients can bypass their original eyecare provider when purchasing replacement lenses 
by marketing its lenses under different brands  segmented by distribution channel  the company believes that it can assist eyecare professionals in retaining their patients and improve a patient s long term eyecare 
international markets 
the company anticipates that many non us markets for soft contact lenses will grow at faster rates than the united states market  driven largely by the increased availability of low priced lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimes in developed but under penetrated markets such as europe  japan and the rest of the world 
however  many markets outside the united states do not have the volume of demand necessary for local manufacturers to achieve the economies of scale required for low cost lens production 
as a result  the company s international strategy includes entering into strategic distribution and marketing relationships with established regional optical companies in addition to some direct representation in select markets such as latin america  mexico and hong kong 
the company offers these companies lower cost lenses  afforded by the company s volume production efficiencies  and the marketing benefits of a private label brand  and the companies provide the company with the benefits of their existing market presence  customer relationships and local infrastructure 
the company believes that this strategy 
table of contents permits it to target effectively growing international markets 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses in further detail our foreign acquisitions 
the following summarizes the company s international sales operations europe 
the acquisition of the essilor businesses gave the company a direct sales channel and greatly expanded presence in europe 
in addition  to expand in this growing market  the company has developed strategic partnerships with a number of regional and local contact lens distributors 
in these relationships  the company s contact lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens are sold under their brand names on a non exclusive basis throughout europe 
the company also currently has distribution relationships in europe and the middle east serving a number of countries  as well as an inside sales organization based in southampton  england that uses telemarketing and other sales methods in the united kingdom that are similar to those used by the company in the united states 
canada 
the company has a direct selling organization based in ontario that uses field sales representatives as well as direct mail  journal promotion and cooperative merchandising allowance programs similar to those used by the company in the united states 
the company also utilizes a small number of canadian distributors to resell its products  primarily to independent eyecare practitioners 
latin america 
the company expects unit growth in the disposable replacement lens segment of this emerging market will grow at a much faster pace than in north america or europe because of the lower level of current user penetration 
to expand the company s penetration of this growing market  the company has entered into a number of non exclusive distribution arrangements in latin america and hired selected local representatives based in miami and mexico city 
asia pacific region 
the company believes that the growth of unit sales in this market will be driven primarily by sales of contact lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens  particularly in japan 
the company has established distribution relationships with a number of soft contact lens distributors in many countries throughout asia 
in  the company acquired two optical goods distributors in australia  one of which was the company s pre existing distributor 
as previously discussed  on march   the company entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of seiko contactlens  inc in japan 
distribution the company believes that its distribution operations provide its customers with cost effective  rapid and reliable deliveries of its products 
because the company s customers place both small orders for individual patients and large inventory stocking orders  the company s fulfillment system has been designed with the flexibility to receive  fill and ship orders as small as a single lens and as large as tens of thousands of lenses 
customers may place orders by toll free telephone call or by facsimile or by the internet 
certain of the company s larger customers use the company s electronic data interchange edi services to place orders and receive order acknowledgments  invoices  inventory status reports and customized pricing information online  improving efficiency and timeliness for both the company and the customer 
if the product is in stock  orders received by pm local time are generally shipped the same day 
the company maintains its primary warehouse and distribution facilities in south san francisco  california  southampton  united kingdom  ligny en barrios  france  and markham  ontario and local distribution in holland  austria and germany 
the largest and most sophisticated of these distribution centers is the south san francisco location  which primarily serves customers in the united states  asia pacific and latin america 
customers in europe are primarily served from the southampton  united kingdom and ligny en barrios  france facilities  and customers in canada are primarily served from the markham  ontario facility 
to further reduce its cost to serve and improve customer service  the company has implemented a highly computerized and automated retrieval system at its south san francisco facility and also partially in its united kingdom facility 
this system incorporates advanced handling processes such as automatic dispensing  automated conveyors and radio frequency dispatch 
these processes are integrated by software that  in turn  is 
table of contents integrated into the company s order entry system  allowing orders to be downloaded  stocking locations determined and fulfillment instructions delivered automatically 
manufacturing substantially all of the company s products are manufactured in facilities in juana diaz  puerto rico  southampton  united kingdom  albuquerque  new mexico  and ligny en barrios  france 
the company generally produces its lenses using a manufacturing process known as dry cast molding 
this process uses a single use  two part plastic mold that is manufactured by injection molding machines utilizing high precision optical tooling that is also made by the company 
a liquid monomer mixture is dispensed into the mold and polymerized to form a finished dry lens 
the mold containing the polymerized lens can be inventoried for an extended period under proper conditions 
the dry lens  once removed from the mold  is immersed in a fluid bath to extract unreacted monomer and to be hydrated and is then inspected  packaged and sterilized 
in general  both the puerto rican and united kingdom plants can hydrate dry lenses manufactured by the other 
these capabilities substantially increase the efficiency and flexibility of the company s manufacturing operations 
the company s dry cast molding process enables the company to consistently reproduce the sophisticated designs of its lenses  including the lenticulated carrier and low edge apex that provide the lenses enhanced shape retention and superior handling characteristics 
in addition  the dry case molding process allows the company to reproduce lenses that are designed to provide fitting characteristics similar to those of the company s leading competitors lenses  regardless of their manufacturing process 
the company also believes that the dry cast molding process provides advantages over certain alternate production methods in yield  throughput efficiency and performance 
for example  each dry lens in the company s cast molding process emerges from the mold completely finished  eliminating the need for additional polishing 
this cast molding process reduces manufacturing steps and facilitates automated handling and inspection 
the company relies on a non exclusive  perpetual  irrevocable patent license for a significant element of its dry cast molding technology 
in addition to dry cast molding  certain of the company s competitors utilize wet cast molding  lathing or spin casting processes 
the company believes that dry cast molding is a highly scaleable process  which makes it well suited to address the high volume requirements of the growing disposable replacement market 
the disposable replacement market  however  is relatively price sensitive  and lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens generally have significantly lower selling prices than lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens 
the company believes that its ability to compete effectively in this growing market will depend on its ability to continue to reduce its per unit production costs while increasing manufacturing capacity and maintaining the high quality of its products 
many of the company s specialty lenses are manufactured using lathing technology 
the lathing process allows the company to manufacture lenses with the high level of customization and accuracy to meet specific patient requirements in the specialty lens market 
the company believes that reducing its manufacturing costs will require increased automation to further improve manufacturing efficiencies and yields  improved packaging designs that utilize lower cost materials and larger production volumes to take advantage of economies of scale 
while the company has implemented a number of cost reduction measures  such as blister packaging  hot water extraction  automatic de molding and in monomer tinting over the past several years  the most significant improvements are expected to come from the ongoing implementation of additional production lines incorporating a new automated process based on the company s current dry cast molding technology 
in  the company completed the construction on a new  square feet manufacturing facility in juana diaz  puerto rico and this united states food and drug administration fda approved facility has been producing product since that time 
in  a new manufacturing facility has begun production of daily disposable lenses in southampton  united kingdom 
the company believes that this new process will reduce the cost per lens below its historical cost while substantially increasing production capacity 

table of contents the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to increase its production volume on a timely basis while maintaining product quality  reducing per unit production costs and complying with the fda s quality system including good manufacturing practices or gmp regulations 
the company cannot assure you that it will not encounter difficulties in expanding and automating its manufacturing facilities and increasing production  including problems involving production yields  quality control  construction delays and shortages of qualified personnel 
the company s failure to reduce per unit production costs and maintain product quality could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
information systems the company s information systems are an integral component of its strategy to minimize its cost to serve and improve customer service 
many aspects of the company s business  including its manufacturing  sales and marketing  distribution and accounting functions have been integrated to facilitate the company s future growth 
research and development the company s research and development efforts are focused primarily on the development of automated manufacturing processes to increase the efficiency and capacity of its manufacturing operations 
see manufacturing 
in addition  the company is engaged in development of new soft contact lens products and additional features 
currently  the company s product development efforts are focused on the development of a new colored lens to be introduced in in june  the company entered into a joint research and development agreement with asahikasei aime co 
ltd  a subsidiary of asahi kasei corporation 
the company will apply its advanced cast molding manufacturing process to a newly developed silicon based material created by asahikasei aime to produce a high performance contact lens 
the company and asahikasei aime will share marketing and distribution rights in asia  while asahikasei aime will retain exclusive rights in japan and the company will retain exclusive rights worldwide outside of japan and asia 
asahikasei aime co  ltd 
develops  manufactures and markets a full range of hard and soft contact lenses 
during the years ended december   and  expenditures for research and development including obtaining regulatory approvals were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  as a result of the acquisition of the contact lens business of essilor on february   the company recorded an acquired in process research and development expense of million 
trademarks  trade secrets and patent licenses the company has numerous trademark registrations in the united states  europe and other foreign countries and believes that its trademarks are among its most valuable assets 
the company s channel specific branding strategy depends on the company s strategic use of its trademark portfolio  as the trademark for each product brand is generally registered 
the company licenses the hydron trademarks under a license agreement that prohibits the use of those trademarks outside of the americas 
the company has obtained non exclusive licenses from third parties to patents for certain contact lens designs and manufacturing technologies used in the production of its products 
the company has obtained a perpetual  fully paid  worldwide  non exclusive  irrevocable license to certain patents and patent applications covering technology that is significant in the company s dry cast molding processes 
the company has filed patent applications for certain aspects of its new automated manufacturing process and its new toric products 
the company has also obtained non exclusive  fully paid  perpetual  worldwide licenses to use certain technology relating to the tinting of lenses and to manufacture a monomer used to produce certain of its lenses in addition to trademarks and patent licenses  the company believes it owns certain trade secrets  copyrights  know how and other intellectual property 

table of contents competition the market for soft contact lenses is intensely competitive 
it is characterized by a limited number of industry participants  an oligopolistic nature arising from significant concentration of market share amongst the three largest manufacturers  high barriers to entry and decreasing prices for many products 
as the number of wearers of soft contact lenses in the united states has not grown significantly in recent years  increased market penetration by the company will require wearers of competing products to switch to the company s products 
the company s products compete with products offered by a number of larger companies including johnson johnson  ciba vision wesley jessen  bausch lomb and the cooper companies 
the three largest companies  johnson johnson  ciba vision and bausch lomb  account for an estimated of the global market opportunity 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources  greater market penetration and larger manufacturing volumes than the company 
among other things  these advantages may afford the company s competitors greater ability to manufacture large volumes of lenses  reduce product prices and influence customer buying decisions 
the company believes that certain of its competitors are expanding  or are planning to expand  their manufacturing capacity  and are implementing new  more automated manufacturing processes  in order to support anticipated increases in volume 
as many of the costs involved in producing contact lenses are relatively fixed  if a manufacturer can increase its volume  it can generally reduce its per unit costs and thereby increase its flexibility to reduce prices 
the company s competitors could also reduce prices to increase sales volumes so as to utilize their capacity  or for other reasons 
price reductions by competitors could make the company s products less competitive  and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to either match the competitor s pricing plan or reduce its prices in response 
the company s ability to respond to competitive pressures by decreasing its prices without adversely affecting its gross margins and operating results will depend on its ability to continue decreasing its costs per lens 
any significant decrease in the company s costs per lens will depend  in part  on the company s ability to increase its sales volume and production capacity 
the market for contact lenses has shifted from lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens to lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens 
the weekly disposable replacement market is particularly competitive and price sensitive and is currently dominated by johnson johnson s acuvue product line 
the company believes that the per unit production costs of johnson johnson and certain of the company s other competitors are currently lower than those of the company 
the company s ability to compete effectively in the disposable lens market will depend in large part upon the company s ability to expand its production capacity and reduce its per unit production costs 
soft contact lens manufacturers have generally sought to differentiate themselves from their competitors on the basis of product performance  marketing  distribution channels and price 
the company believes that its manufacturing process technology  lens designs and marketing strategies differentiate it from its leading competitors 
in addition  since the purchase of contact lenses requires a prescription in the united states  the company also competes on the basis of  and believes it is distinguishable from its competitors based on  its relationships and reputation with eyecare practitioners 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to so distinguish its products or that competitors will not adopt technologies  lens designs or marketing strategies that are similar to those used by the company 
any such action by competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also encounters competition from manufacturers of eyeglasses and from alternative technologies  such as surgical refractive procedures 
if surgical refractive procedures become increasingly accepted as an effective and safe technique for permanent vision correction  they could substantially reduce the demand for contact lenses by enabling patients to avoid the ongoing cost and inconvenience of contact lenses 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that these procedures  or other alternative technologies that may be developed in the future  will not cause a substantial decline in the number of contact lens wearers and thus have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents government regulation the us federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act and the other statutes and regulations of the fda and other state and foreign agencies govern the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution  sale  marketing  advertising and promotion of the company s products 
noncompliance with such statutes and regulations can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  product recall or product seizures  operating restrictions including suspension of production and distribution  the fda s refusal to grant marketing approval or clearance for a product  the withdrawal of previously granted marketing approvals or clearances  and criminal prosecution 
sales of the company s products outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that  while generally comparable to those in the united states  vary widely from country to country 
fda regulation 
the company must obtain fda approval or clearance for marketing our new contact lenses prior to their release 
there are two primary means by which the fda permits a medical device  including contact lenses  to be marketed  either through pre market approval pma or by a k filing 
a pma is required for any device which is not substantially equal to a device already in the marketplace or for a device that is critical in nature 
the request for a pma must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes extensive data  including data from preclinical testing and human clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device 
ordinarily  the fda requires the performance of at least two independent  statistically significant human clinical trials 
once the fda accepts a pma submission for filing  it begins an in depth review of the pma 
an fda review of a pma generally takes from twelve to eighteen months from the date the pma is accepted for filing  but may take significantly longer if the fda requests additional information or if the pma is materially amended 
toward the end of the pma review process  the fda generally will inspect the manufacturer s facilities to ensure that they comply with gmp requirements 
if the fda s evaluations of both the pma and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will issue either an approval letter order or an approvable letter containing a number of conditions to be met in order to secure approval of a pma 
once those conditions have been fulfilled  the fda will approve the pma and authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications 
the pma process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy  and the company cannot assure you that the fda will approve any particular product for marketing 
for certain products  the company may be required to seek clearance by filing a k premarket notification with the fda 
to obtain that clearance  the k premarket notification must establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a device that has been legally marketed or was marketed before may  the company may not place the device into commercial distribution in the united states until the fda issues a substantial equivalence determination notice 
this notice may be issued within days of submission  but usually takes longer 
the fda  however  may determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent  or require further information  such as additional test data or clinical data  or require modifications to the product labeling  before it will make a finding of substantial equivalence 
in addition  the fda may inspect the company s manufacturing facility before issuing a notice of substantial equivalence and may delay or decline to issue that notice until the facility is found to be in compliance with gmp requirements 
the process of obtaining fda clearance of a k premarket notification  including testing  preparation and subsequent fda review  can take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
modifications to existing k cleared devices  including changes in design  material  or manufacturing process that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness  require submission and clearance of new k notifications  as do significant changes in labeling 
modifications to a device that is the subject of an approved pma  including to its labeling or manufacturing process  ordinarily require fda approval of pma supplements or new pmas 
to supplement a pma the company must typically submit information similar to what is required for an initial pma  except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original pma 
fda approval of supplemental pmas requires approximately one to two years 
the fda classifies medical devices as class i  ii or iii  on the basis of the controls the fda deems necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness 
the company s daily wear products have been 
table of contents classified as class ii devices and as such are subject to the k pre market notification process 
the company s extended wear products have been classified as class iii devices and are subject to the pma requirements 
all of the products the company currently markets have received k clearance or pma approval  including the company s daily disposable lenses 
the company has made minor modifications to its lenses which it believes do not require the submission and clearance of new k notifications or the submission and approval of pma supplements 
the company cannot assure you  however  that the fda will agree with the company s determinations not to submit new k notifications or pma supplements for these changes  that the fda will not require the company to cease sales and distribution while seeking clearances of k notifications or approvals of pma supplements for the changes  or that such clearances and approvals  if required  will be obtained in a timely manner or at all 
the fdc act also requires that the company manufacture its products in accordance with the fda s quality system regulations  which include the gmp requirements 
these regulations require  among other things  that the company regulate  control and document its manufacturing process and validate by extensive and detailed testing its ability to produce devices which meet the specifications 
the company is also required to investigate any deficiencies in the manufacturing process or in the products produced  use purchasing controls  keep detailed records and impose pre production design controls 
the fda can inspect the company s manufacturing facilities on a periodic basis to monitor compliance with the quality system regulations 
if the company violates the applicable regulations the fda can prohibit further manufacturing  distribution and sale of the company s products until the violations are cured 
the company believes that its facilities are in compliance with the fda s quality system regulations and that the planned automation of its manufacturing facilities will not require clearance or approval 
international regulation 
sales of the company s products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
these laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex clearance and production controls such as those described previously 
as a result  the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing approval may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain fda approval 
these differences may affect the efficiency and timeliness of international market introduction of the company s products  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for its products in foreign countries 
medical devices  including contact lenses  sold or marketed in the european union eu are subject to its medical device directive 
this directive makes ce mark certification procedures available for medical devices 
in general  medical devices may not be sold in eu countries unless they display the ce mark 
in order to obtain ce mark certification for its products  the company must obtain certification that its processes meet certain quality standards and establish that its products are safe and fit for their intended purpose 
although member countries must accept for marketing medical devices bearing a ce marking without imposing further requirements related to product safety and performance  each country may require the use of its own language or labels and instructions for use 
the company may have to obtain additional approvals from foreign regulatory authorities in order to sell its products in non eu countries 
some countries have historically permitted human studies earlier in the product development cycle than regulations in the united states permit 
other countries  such as japan  have requirements similar to those of the united states 
this disparity in the regulation of medical devices may result in more rapid product clearance in certain countries than in the united states  while approvals in countries such as japan may require longer periods than in the united states 
other regulation 
the company is also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations or that compliance with such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s ability to do business

intense competition 
the market for soft contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by lower prices for many products 
as the number of wearers of soft contact lenses in the united states has not grown significantly in recent years  increased united states market penetration by the company will require wearers of competing products to switch to the company s products 
the company s products compete with similar products offered by a number of larger companies including johnson johnson  ciba wesley jessen  bausch lomb  and cooper 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources  greater market penetration and larger manufacturing volumes than the company 
among other things  these advantages may afford the company s competitors greater ability to manufacture large volumes of lenses  reduce product prices and influence customer buying decisions 
the company believes that certain of its competitors are expanding  or are planning to expand their manufacturing capacity  and are implementing automated manufacturing processes  in order to support anticipated increases in volume 
because many of the costs incurred in producing contact lenses are relatively fixed  a manufacturer that can increase its volume can generally reduce its per unit costs and thereby increase its flexibility to reduce prices 
the company s competitors could also reduce prices to increase sales volumes so as to utilize their production capacity  or for other reasons 
price reductions by competitors could make the company s products less competitive  and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to either match the competitor s pricing plan or reduce its prices in response 
the company s ability to respond to competitive pressures by decreasing its prices without adversely affecting its gross margins and operating results will depend on its ability to decrease its costs per lens 
any significant decrease in the company s costs per lens will depend  in part  on the company s ability to increase its sales volume and production capacity 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to increase its sales volume or reduce its per unit production costs 
the failure of the company to respond to competitive pressures and particularly price competition  in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results 
see manufacturing capacity constraints  risks associated with expansion and automation of manufacturing operations 
the market for contact lenses is shifting from lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens to lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens 
the weekly disposable replacement market is particularly competitive and price sensitive and is currently dominated by the acuvue product produced by johnson johnson 
the company has introduced a lens marketed for daily disposal in japan and europe and is currently testing the introduction of such a lens in the united states 
the company s ability to enter and to compete effectively in the daily market will depend in large part upon the company s ability to expand its production capacity and reduce its per unit production costs 

table of contents the company believes that its manufacturing process technology  lens designs and marketing strategies differentiate the company from its leading competitors 
however  there can be no assurance that competitors will not adopt technologies  lens designs or marketing strategies that are similar or better then those used by the company 
any such action by competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also encounters competition from manufacturers of eyeglasses and from alternative technologies  such as surgical refractive procedures including new refractive laser procedures such as prk  or photo refractive keratectomy  and lasik  or laser in situ keratomileusis 
if surgical refractive procedures become increasingly accepted as an effective and safe technique for permanent vision correction  they could substantially reduce the demand for contact lenses by enabling patients to avoid the ongoing cost and inconvenience of contact lenses 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that these procedures  or other alternative technologies that may be developed in the future  will not cause a substantial decline in the number of contact lens wearers and thus have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing capacity constraints  risks associated with expansion and automation of manufacturing operations 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to increase its production volume on a timely basis while maintaining product quality and lowering per unit production costs 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in increasing production volumes  including problems involving delays  quality control and shortages of qualified personnel 
the company is currently operating close to  or in certain cases at  capacity  and while incremental increases in capacity are implemented by the company in the ordinary course  the company expects to need more significant increases in capacity in the foreseeable future 
to this end  the company continues to add new  highly automated production technology at its facilities in the united kingdom and puerto rico to increase its manufacturing capacity and reduce its per unit manufacturing costs 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to implement this automated technology on a timely basis or that the automated technology will operate as efficiently as expected 
the company has encountered delays in implementing the initial phases of this automated technology and there can be no assurance that it will not encounter significant delays and difficulties in the future as the company intends to add additional lines 
for example  suppliers could miss their equipment delivery schedules  new production lines and facility could improve less rapidly than expected  if at all  or the equipment or processes could require longer design time than anticipated  or redesigning after installation 
in  delays in implementing the initial phases of the automated lines had caused the company difficulties in meeting customer demand in certain of its products 
the new production technology may involve processes and equipment with which the company and its personnel are not fully experienced 
difficulties experienced by the company in automating its manufacturing process could impair the company s ability to reduce its per unit production costs and to compete in the weekly and daily disposable replacement market and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company currently projects through the end of  that it will invest approximately million in capital expenditures on automated production lines and other items in the united kingdom and puerto rico and on other items elsewhere 
the company intends to finance these capital expenditures with net cash provided by operating activities  existing cash balances and borrowings under its credit facilities 
risk of trade practice litigation  changes in trade practices 
the contact lens industry has been the subject of a number of class action and government lawsuits and government investigations in recent years 
in december  over twenty states sued three of the company s largest competitors  as well as certain eyecare practitioners and trade organizations 
the lawsuit alleges among other things  a conspiracy among such persons to violate antitrust laws by refusing to sell contact lenses to mail order and other non practitioner contact lens providers  so as to reduce competition in the contact lens industry 
a similar lawsuit was filed by the state of florida in and several similar class action lawsuits were also filed in the defendants have agreed to settle the lawsuits as to themselves by agreeing to sell contact lenses to mail order and other alternative distribution channels  and by making substantial cash and product rebates and coupons available to consumers 

table of contents in an unrelated matter  one of the company s largest competitors was sued in a national class action lawsuit brought in the federal district court in the northern district of alabama in the alabama lawsuit 
this suit alleged that the defendant engaged in fraudulent and deceptive practices in the marketing and sale of contact lenses by selling identical contact lenses  under different brand names and for different replacement regimens  at different prices 
the defendant subsequently modified certain of its marketing practices and ultimately settled the lawsuit in august by making substantial cash and product payments available to consumers 
in august  such competitor also settled an investigation by states into similar matters by agreeing to certain restrictions on its future contact lens marketing practices and making certain payments to each of the states 
in october  a class action lawsuit was brought against another of the company s largest competitors in the superior court of new jersey camden the new jersey lawsuit 
this suit alleges that the defendant engaged in fraudulent and deceptive practices in the marketing and sale of contact lenses by selling interchangeable contact lenses  under different brand names and for different replacement regimens  at different prices 
the suit was certified as a national class action in december although the company has not been named in any of the foregoing lawsuits  the company from time to time receives claims or threats similar to those brought against its competitors  and in one circumstance a suit was filed against the company making allegations similar to those made in the alabama and new jersey lawsuits  which suit was dismissed without prejudice for non substantive reasons 
there can be no assurance that the company will not face similar actions relating to its marketing and pricing practices or other claims or lawsuits in the future 
the defense of any such action  lawsuit or claim could result in substantial expense to the company and significant diversion of attention and effort by the company s management personnel 
there can be no assurance that any such lawsuit would be settled or decided in a manner favorable to the company  and a settlement or adverse decision in any such action  lawsuit or claim could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the foregoing lawsuits  there is substantial federal and state governmental regulation related to the prescribing of contact lenses 
these regulations relate to who is permitted to prescribe and fit contact lenses  the prescriber s obligation to provide prescriptions to its patients  the length of time a prescription is valid  the ability or obligation of prescribers to prescribe lenses by brand rather than by generic equivalent or specification  and other matters 
although these regulations primarily affect contact lens prescribers  and not manufacturers or distributors of lenses such as the company  changes in these regulations  or their interpretation or enforcement  could adversely affect the effectiveness of the company s marketing strategy to eyecare practitioners  most notably the effectiveness of the company s channel specific and private label branding strategies 
additionally  given the company s strategic emphasis on focusing its marketing efforts on eyecare practitioners  the company may be more vulnerable than its competitors to changes in current trade practices 
finally  although cost controls or other requirements imposed by third party health care payors such as insurers and health maintenance organizations have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices  this could change in the future  and could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse regulatory or other decisions affecting eyecare practitioners  or material changes in the selling and prescribing practices for contact lenses  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in operating results  decreasing average sales prices 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future based upon a number of factors 
the company s quarterly results can be affected significantly by pricing changes by the company or its competitors  the company s ability to increase manufacturing capacity efficiently and to reduce per unit manufacturing costs  the time and costs involved in expanding existing distribution channels and establishing new distribution channels  discretionary marketing and promotional expenditures such as cooperative merchandising allowances paid to the company s customers  timing of the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  inventory shortages  timing of regulatory approvals and other factors 
the company s customers generally do not have long term commitments to purchase products and products are generally shipped as orders are received 
consequently  quarterly sales and operating results depend primarily on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which may be difficult to forecast 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is relatively fixed  and planned 
table of contents expenditures are based on sales forecasts 
if sales levels fall below expectations  operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in particular  the affect on net income may be proportionately greater than net sales because only a portion of the company s expenses varies with net sales in the short term 
in response to competition  the company may reduce prices  increase cooperative merchandising allowances or otherwise increase marketing expenditures 
such responses may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the foregoing factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
further  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s net sales or operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
the company expects that the overall average selling price that it realizes across its products will decline over time because of i shifts in the company s product mix from lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens to lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens  and ii increases in products sold internationally through distributors at prices lower than direct sales prices 
the company does not expect there will be significant growth in its sales of lenses marketed for annual or monthly replacement 
accordingly  the company will need to continue to reduce its per unit production costs through increased automation  increased volume and reduced packaging costs in order to improve or maintain  its gross margins 
the failure of the company to accomplish some or all of the foregoing and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and result of operations 
risks relating to international operations  need to increase sales in international markets 
in  and  the company s international sales represented approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s products are manufactured in the united kingdom 
as a result  the company s business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad  such as foreign consumer preferences  changes in currency exchange rates  increase government regulations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  and foreign tax laws or tariffs 
these factors  among others  could materially adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products in international markets 
the regulation of medical devices in a number of jurisdictions  particularly in the european union  continues to develop  and there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a portion of the company s sales and expenditures are collected or paid in currencies other than the united states dollar 
therefore  the company s operating results are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not hedge its currency risk  and accordingly there can be no assurance that in the future exchange rate movements will not have a material adverse effect on the company s sales  gross profit  operating expenses or foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
the company s continued growth is dependent on the expansion of international sales of its products 
this expansion will involve operations in markets with which the company is not experienced and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in capturing a significant portion of these markets for contact lenses 
in addition  the company will not be able to market and sell its products in certain international markets until it obtains the applicable regulatory approval 
the failure of the company to increase its international sales substantially could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertain ability to manage growth  risks associated with implementation of new management information 
the company has experienced rapid growth in recent years 
continued rapid growth may place significant strain on management  operational infrastructure  working capital and financial and management control systems 
growth in the company s business has required  and is expected to continue to require  significant personnel management and other infrastructure resources 
the company s ability to manage any future growth effectively will require it to attract  train  motivate and manage new employees successfully  to integrate new employees into its overall operations and to continue to improve its operational  financial and management information systems 

table of contents risk of new products and technological change 
the company has not historically allocated substantial resources to new product development  but rather has leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others 
recently the company has begun to invest more in new product development 
however  generally the company s expenditures in this area are significantly below those of its competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company s investments in new product development will be successful 
there also can be no assurance that the company s competitors do not have or will not develop new products and technologies that could render the company s products less competitive or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop its own technology or utilize technology developed by third parties in order to compete in these product areas 
any failure by the company to stay current with its competitors with regard to new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with interruption of manufacturing operations 
the company manufactures substantially all of the products it sells 
as a result  any prolonged disruption in the operations of the company s various manufacturing facilities  whether due to technical or labor difficulties  destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in this regard  one of the company s principal manufacturing facilities is located in puerto rico and is thus exposed to the risks of damage from windstorms and floods 
if this facility were to be out of production for an extended period  the company s business  financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected 
see manufacturing 
risks of regulatory action 
the company s products and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent regulation by the fda and by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which the company s products are manufactured and or sold  as well as by governmental agencies in certain foreign countries in which the company s products are manufactured and or sold 
pursuant to the fdc act and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the pre clinical and clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution  sale  marketing  advertising and promotion of medical devices such as contact lenses 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory clearances or approvals can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  suspensions or withdrawals of regulatory clearances or approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions including suspension of production  distribution  sales and marketing  product seizures and criminal prosecution of a company and its officers and employees 
in addition  governmental regulations may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory clearances or approval of the company s products 
delays in receiving necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals  failure to receive clearances or approvals  or the loss of previously received clearances or approvals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in general  the fdc act requires that a new medical device be cleared by the fda prior to introducing such product to the united states market through the submission of a k notification  exempted from the requirement of such clearance  or approved by the fda prior to introducing such product to the market through the submission of a pma 
the process of obtaining clearance of a k notification typically takes five to twelve months without clinical data  or twelve to eighteen months or more if clinical data are required to be included in the notification  but it may take longer  and k clearance may never be obtained 
approval through the pma process  which likewise may never be obtained  generally takes at least eighteen to twenty four months and can take substantially longer  is more expensive and requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and manufacturing information  among other things 
the soft contact lenses currently marketed by the company have received fda clearance through the k process or approval through the pma process 
in addition  the company has made modifications to its products that the company believes do not require the submission of new k notifications or pma supplements 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fda will agree with any of the company s determinations not to submit new k notifications or pma supplements for these changes  that the fda will not require the company to cease sales and distribution while seeking clearances of k notifications and approvals of pma supplements for the changes  or that such clearances and approvals  if required  will be obtained in a timely 
table of contents manner or at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any future products developed by the company or any modifications to current products will not require additional clearances or approvals from the fda  or that such approvals  if necessary  will be obtained in a timely manner or at all 
the company s manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic gmp and other inspections by the fda 
any actions required by the fda as a result of any recent or future inspections could involve significant costs or disruption to the company s operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  noncompliance with quality system including gmp requirements could result in the cessation or reduction of the company s production volume  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
these laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex clearance and production controls in others 
some countries have historically permitted human studies earlier in the product development cycle than regulations in the united states permit 
other countries have requirements similar to those of the united states 
this disparity in the regulation of medical devices may result in more rapid product clearance in certain countries than in the united states  while approvals in countries such as japan may require longer periods than in the united states 
these differences may also affect the efficiency and timeliness of international market introduction of the company s products  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for its products in foreign countries in a timely manner or at all 
see government regulation 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is dependent upon certain key management and technical personnel 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
the company competes for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in retaining or hiring qualified personnel 
the loss of any of the company s senior management or other key research  clinical  regulatory  or sales and marketing personnel  particularly to competitors  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

influence by existing stockholders 
directors  officers and principal stockholders of the company  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  possess significant voting influence over the election of the company s board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions  among other matters 
such influence could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management 
certain anti takeover provisions 
the company s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock are subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible financing or acquisitions or other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
the company has no current plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
the company s bylaws and indemnity agreements provide that the company will indemnify officers and directors against losses they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to the company 
further  the company s charter documents contain a provision eliminating the ability of the company s stockholders to take action by written consent 
this provision is designed to reduce the vulnerability of the company to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and to render the use of stockholder written consents unavailable as a tactic in a proxy fight 
however  such provision could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for the company s shares  thereby inhibiting increases in the market price of the company s shares that could result from actual or 
table of contents rumored takeover attempts 
such provision also may have the effect of preventing changes in the management of the company

volatility of stock price 
the market price of company s common stock is  and is likely to continue to be  volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company s operating results or those of its competitors  competitive factors  trade practice litigation  new products offered by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  conditions and trends in its industry and other related industries  regulatory actions  adoption of new accounting standards  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
such litigation  if brought against the company  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources

risks of inability to effectively protect intellectual property 
the company is highly dependent upon its intellectual property 
the company believes that its trademarks are among its most valuable assets and has numerous trademark registrations in the united states  europe and other foreign countries 
while the company believes that there are currently no pending challenges to the use or registration of any of the company s material trademarks  it cannot assure you  however  that the company s trademarks do not or will not violate the proprietary rights of others  that they would be upheld if challenged or that the company would  in such an event  not be prevented from using its trademarks  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company and its business 
the company has obtained non exclusive licenses from third parties to patents for certain contact lens designs and manufacturing technologies used in the production of its products  including its dry cast molding processes 
the company has also obtained non exclusive  fully paid  perpetual  worldwide licenses to use certain technology relating to the tinting of lenses and to manufacture a monomer used to produce certain of its lenses 
the company cannot assure you that if it desires or is required to renew these licenses or to obtain additional licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others  that any such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
in addition  the company has filed patent applications on certain aspects of its new automated manufacturing process and new toric and color products 
the company cannot assure you that it will be successful in obtaining additional necessary patent and license rights  that the patents it has obtained  or any patents it may obtain as a result of pending patent applications  will provide any competitive advantages for its products  that those patents will not be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future or that competitors have not already applied for or obtained or will not seek to apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with the company s ability to make  use and sell its products 
patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing and the company may not be aware of all of the patents and patent applications potentially adverse to its interests 
in addition to trademarks and patent licenses  the company owns certain trade secrets  copyrights  know how and other intellectual property 
the company seeks to protect these assets  in part  by entering into confidentiality agreements with certain of its business partners  consultants and vendors 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that the company s trade secrets and other intellectual property will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by others and thereby become unprotected 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that competitors will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s proprietary technology or that the company can meaningfully protect its rights in un patented proprietary technology 

table of contents the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits and related administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming 
litigation may be necessary to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect its trade secret or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
there can be no assurance that the prosecution and defense of the company s intellectual property will be successful or that the company will be able to secure adequate intellectual property protections in the future 
if the outcome of any such litigation or interference proceedings is adverse to the company  it could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties or require the company to license disputed rights from third parties or cease using such technology  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
the protection of intellectual property in certain foreign countries is particularly uncertain 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing and selling its products  and such events would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key suppliers 
the company depends on several key suppliers for some of its product components 
if the supply of materials from a key supplier were interrupted  replacement or alternative sources might not be readily obtainable due to the regulatory requirements applicable to the company s manufacturing operations 
in addition  a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities may require clearance prior to the company marketing a product containing new material 
this clearance process may take a substantial period of time and prove costly  and the company cannot assure you that it would be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approval for the new material to be used in its products on a timely basis  if at all 
the supply disruptions could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
risks associated with revenues concentrated in the health care industry and exposure to regulatory and economic changes in that industry 
the company s products are sold to practitioners in the health care industry 
as a result  the company s ability to collect accounts receivable from eyecare practitioners may be compromised by regulatory or economic changes in the health care industry 
the inability of the company to collect accounts receivable would have a material adverse effect on its revenues  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with government regulation of the health care industry 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the success of its customers in the retail optical industry 
these customers are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances  including those regarding advertising  location and design of stores  products sold and qualifications and practices of the industry 
the state and local legal requirements vary widely among jurisdictions and are subject to frequent change 
furthermore  numerous health care related legislative proposals have been made in recent years in the united states congress and in various state legislatures 
the potential impact of these proposals with respect to the business of the company s customers is uncertain  and there is no assurance that the proposals  if adopted  would not have a material adverse impact on the company 
there is substantial united states federal and state governmental regulation related to the prescribing of contact lenses 
these regulations relate to who is permitted to prescribe and fit contact lenses  the prescriber s obligation to provide prescriptions to its patients  the length of time a prescription is valid  the ability or obligation of prescribers to prescribe lenses by brand rather than by generic equivalent or specification  and other matters 
although these regulations primarily affect contact lens prescribers  and not manufacturers or distributors of lenses such as the company  changes in these regulations  or their interpretation or enforcement  could adversely affect the effectiveness of the company s marketing strategy to eyecare practitioners  most notably the effectiveness of the company s channel specific and private label branding strategies 
additionally  given the company s strategic emphasis on focusing its marketing efforts on eyecare practitioners rather than consumers  the company may be more vulnerable than its competitors to changes in current trade practices 
adverse regulatory or other decisions affecting eyecare practitioners  or material changes in the selling and prescribing practices for contact lenses  could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents risks of product liability and insufficient product liability insurance 
the company has in the past been  and continues to be  subject to product liability claims and lawsuits 
because contact lenses are medical devices  the company faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products results in personal injury 
the company also faces the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of its products might necessitate a product recall 
from time to time  the company has received  and may continue to receive  complaints of significant patient discomfort  including corneal scarring and complications  while using the company s contact lenses 
in certain cases  the reasons for the problems have never been established 
in addition  on two occasions  in and  the company has recalled limited volumes of certain of its product because certain labels on the vial or blister did not match the enclosed lens 
also in  the company recalled a substantial volume of certain of its products because of an incorrect sterility seal on the product blister 
although the company has not experienced material losses to date due to product liability claims or product recalls  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such losses in the future 
a successful product liability claim brought against the company in excess of its insurance coverage  if any  may require the company to pay substantial amounts 
this could adversely affect the company s results of operations and its need for and the timing of additional financing 
in addition  although the company believes it currently maintains sufficient product liability insurance coverage  if the company is unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  it may be unable to market its products 
declines in general economic conditions 
consumer spending patterns  including the consumption of contact lenses  are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  wage rates  inflation  new housing starts  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
weak economic conditions may cause a decline in the number of people fitted for contact lenses  cause consumers to increase the length of time between doctor visits and to replace their contact lenses less frequently  slow the migration of consumers to contact lenses from other types of vision correction and slow the migration of consumers to disposable replacement regimes 
general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions may adversely affect the company s business results and the market price of our common stock 
future acquisitions 
the company has completed in the past  and intends in the future to pursue  acquisitions of businesses that would help the company achieve its strategic goals 
future acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
the company cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully assimilate the businesses that it has acquired  including those acquired from essilor  and that  in the event that any acquisition were to occur in the future  its business  financial condition and results of operations would not be materially adversely affected

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item risk factors 
overview since the company s incorporation in  its strategy has been to market high quality contact lenses to eyecare practitioners at competitive prices using a low cost to serve operating structure 
the company continues to maintain this worldwide strategy 
the contact lens industry as well as the company s business are characterized by increasing unit sales and declining average selling prices  resulting primarily from a world wide shift in demand from lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens to lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens 
since the company launched its first lens marketed for weekly replacement regimens  in the summer of  the company has seen increased net sales each year 
the company believes its share of the market for lenses marketed for its products increased slightly in resulting from substantial increases in sales as a result of an increase in the size of the us sales force  the acquisition of the essilor contact lens business and strong international demand for its products internationally

critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition for its various business units  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  excess and obsolete inventory  cooperative merchandising allowances  
table of contents accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and estimates inherent in purchase accounting 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized based on the terms of sale with the customer  generally upon product shipment 
the company has established programs that  under specified conditions  enable customers to return product 
the company establishes liabilities for estimated returns and allowances at the time revenues are recognized 
in addition  accruals for customer discounts and rebates are recorded when revenues are recognized 
amounts billed to customers in sale transactions related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles for revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company s revenue recognition policies complied with the guidance contained in sab no 
and  therefore  the company s results of operations were not materially affected 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
management specifically analyzes the aging of accounts receivable and also analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  and sales returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and or expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
excess and obsolete inventory the company assesses the need for reserves on inventory based on monthly forward projections of sales of products that are updated monthly 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
cost includes material  labor and applicable factory overhead 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based upon management s analysis of inventory levels and forecasted sales 
once inventory is reserved  the reserve can only be relieved by the subsequent sale or scrapping of the inventory 
cooperative merchandise allowance in april  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  vendor income statement characterization of consideration to a purchaser of the vendor s products or services 
eitf addresses the income statement classification of consideration  from a vendor to a reseller  or another party that purchases the vendor s products 
among its requirements  the consensus will require certain of our customer promotional incentive payments  primarily cooperative merchandising allowances  currently classified as marketing costs to be classified as a reduction of revenue 
a majority of our promotional expenses may be required to be classified as a reduction of revenue with a corresponding reduction in marketing expenses 
annual promotional expenses classified as marketing costs were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
this change will be effective for the first quarter of

 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
in preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities against net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjust these estimates in future periods  which could materially impact financial position and results of operations 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill the company periodically reviews long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to these assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  the company initiates its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future gross revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these costs and result in a write down of the carrying amount or a shortened life of acquired intangibles in the future 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  the company will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the company expects to complete its initial review during the first quarter of  but does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
estimates inherent in purchase accounting purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed 
in our recording of the acquisition of the assets of essilor on february   values were assigned to in process research and development iprd and intangible assets for acquired technology and goodwill based on management s forecasts and projections that include assumptions related to future revenues and cash flows generated from the acquired assets 
the allocation of purchase price to iprd of million represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the acquisition date  the development of these projects had not reached technological feasibility and the research and development 
table of contents in progress had no alternative uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in the statement of operations for the year ended december  iprd was identified and valued through extensive interviews  analysis of data concerning developmental products  their stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete them  and  if applicable  their expected income generating ability  target markets and associated risks 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the iprd 
the projected incremental cash flows were discounted back to their present value using a various discount rates determined after consideration of various factors including the company s cost of capital and the risk associated with the various product types 
the acquired existing intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over an specific estimated remaining useful lives of each intangible asset 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the asset will generate revenue 
intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable

discounts and allowances for sales returns are accrued at the time sales are recognized 
net sales increased from to from million to million and consisted primarily of the company s lenses marketed for daily  weekly  and monthly replacement regimens  products acquired in the essilor acquisition and the company s new toric disposable lens 
unit sales growth of the company s lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens increased due to growth from both domestic and international markets  from the expansion of the us sales force and the strengthened selling and distribution channels acquired from essilor 
international sales were driven by the continued growth of the european and japanese markets and the company s expanding presence in these markets 
the company s overall average selling price increased from to  primarily as a result of the higher priced products acquired in the essilor acquisition offset by continued price competition on the company s daily and weekly disposable products 
the company expects that the overall average selling price that it realizes across its products will decline over time because of shifts in the company s product mix from lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens to lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens  particularly lenses marketed for daily disposal

gross profit in dollars and as a percentage of sales in both increased from the comparable period in due to higher margin products and increased sales from the essilor acquisition  as discussed in net sales and by lower production costs resulting from the implementation of certain manufacturing process improvements and increases in manufacturing volume 
the company expects cost reductions resulting from improvements in the company s current production processes will continue in the future 
specifically  the company is in the process of adding new automated production lines at its united kingdom and puerto rico facilities  which are designed to further reduce its per unit cost of production over time  although such cost reductions may not be seen until future periods 
the company expects that its overall average selling price will continue to decline over time due to product and geographic mix shift  as discussed above in net sales 
the company will need to continue to reduce its per unit production costs through increased automation  increased volume and reduced packaging costs in order to improve  or even to maintain  its gross margin percentage 
the company believes that the decline in average selling price  as sales of lower average selling price lenses marketed for daily replacement regimens increase  may exceed the rate of decline in production cost in the near term and accordingly  the company would expect continued pressure on its gross profit margins in the future for its products 
selling and marketing expenses years ended december  change selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales selling and marketing expenses are comprised primarily of cooperative merchandising allowances  sample diagnostic products provided to eye care practitioners without charge  salaries  commissions and benefits for selling and marketing personnel and postage and freight charges

such activities may include  but are not limited to advertising  in office promotion  displays and mailings 
these allowances are limited to a percentage of purchases of lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens from the company 
the increase in dollars and percentage terms from to resulted primarily from increases in expenditures related to cooperative merchandising allowances  promotional programs  full year cost of outside sales representatives for the largest us markets and the increased sales and marketing resources added in europe

write off of impaired manufacturing equipment years ended december  change write off of impaired manufacturing equipment  n a as a percentage of net sales the write off of impaired manufacturing equipment was attributable to the implementation of our second generation daily disposable manufacturing process in southampton  united kingdom 
this new facility uses our second generation manufacturing process and when fully utilized over the next to months is expected to add considerable daily disposable manufacturing capacity while reducing manufacturing costs versus current daily disposable lens costs 
we believe our second generation manufacturing process will allow us to achieve manufacturing cost parity for daily disposables  which are a rapidly growing category throughout the world 
additionally  we believe the second generation process could be applied to the manufacturing process of other major product lines and further reduce our manufacturing costs 
with the implementation of the first production line utilizing the second generation manufacturing process  we concluded that certain existing manufacturing equipment had become impaired 
as a result  we recorded during the fourth quarter a one time charge of million  or as a percentage of sales  for the write off of impaired manufacturing equipment arising from the second generation manufacturing process

unit sales growth of the company s lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens increased from to a significant portion of such growth came from international sales  which grew while domestic sales declined in as expected  intense competition for market share in the us  the impact of the proposed merger with wesley jessen  capacity constraints and a slowly growing us market for soft contact lenses contributed to the decline in us sales for the year 
international sales were driven by the continued growth of the european and japanese market and the company s expanding presence in these markets 
the company s overall average selling price decreased from to  primarily as a result of the increase in sales of lenses marketed in international markets through distributors  which have lower average selling prices  and the intense price competition on the company s daily and weekly disposable products 
the company expects that the overall average selling price that it realizes across its products will 
table of contents continue to decline over time because of i shifts in the company s product mix from lenses marketed for annual replacement regimens to lenses marketed for disposable replacement regimens  particularly lenses marketed for daily disposal  and ii increases in products sold internationally to distributors at prices lower than direct sales prices in the united states

 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for a business combination at the date a business combination is completed 
the statement requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   thereby eliminating use of the pooling of interests method 
we adopted this statement as of july  sfas no 
provides guidance on how to account for goodwill and intangible assets after an acquisition is completed

we are currently evaluating the impact of this statement as we expect to adopt the statement at the beginning of fiscal in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  in that it removes goodwill from its impairment scope and allows for different approaches in cash flow estimation 
however  sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for a recognition and measurement of long live assets to be held and used and b measurement of ling lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
also supersedes the business segment concept in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  in that it permits presentation of a component of an entity  whether classified as held for sale or disposed of  as a discontinued operation 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect a material impact from adoption of this statement
