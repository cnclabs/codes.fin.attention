the loss of a significant customer could have an adverse effect on our business 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
sam s club and wal mart accounted for approximately   respectively  of our sales year ended july  we do not maintain agreements with our customers and sell products pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
the loss of a significant customer could have an adverse effect on our business 
we face significant competition in the marketing and sale of our products 
our products compete for consumer recognition and shelf space with candies  cakes  cookies  chocolates and other food products which have achieved international  national  regional and local brand recognition and consumer loyalty 
these products are marketed by companies which may include our suppliers with significantly greater financial  manufacturing  marketing  distribution  personnel and other resources than we have 
some of these competitors  such as hershey food corporation  m m mars  inc  nestle  sa  nabisco  inc  keebler company and sunshine biscuits  inc  dominate the markets for candy and cookie products  and have substantial promotional budgets which enable them to implement extensive advertising campaigns 
the food industry is characterized by frequent introductions of new products  accompanied by substantial promotional campaigns 
if we are unable to continue to compete successfully our business could be adversely affected 
we face various risks relating to a recent acquisition 
we recently acquired the business of asher candy acquisition corporation 
asher candy acquisition corporation manufactured candy canes  a product which we had no prior experience in manufacturing 
if we are unable to successfully produce a quality product  and maintain or increase the customer base  our profitability could be adversely affected 
our success is highly dependent on consumer preferences and industry factors 
the markets for candy and cookie products are affected by changes in consumer tastes and preferences and nutritional and health related concerns 
we could be subject to increased competition from companies whose products or marketing strategies address these concerns 
in addition  the markets for our products may be subject to national  regional and local economic conditions which affect discretionary spending  demographic trends and product life cycles  whereby product sales increase from their introductory stage through their maturity and then reach a stage of decline over time 
we have limited historical profitability and may not be profitable in the future 
we have historically  until recently  achieved limited profitability 
our operating expenses have increased and can be expected to continue to increase in connection with any expansion activities undertaken by us  including those relating to advertising and product manufacturing 
accordingly  our profitability will depend on our ability to improve our operating margins and increase revenues from operations 
unanticipated expenses  unfavorable currency exchange rates  increased price competition and adverse changes in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are unable to achieve significantly increased levels of revenues  our future operations may not continue to be profitable 
we depend on our trademarks 
we hold united states trademark registrations for the elana  ruger  tongue tattoo  strip o pop  smile pops and demitasse names  and have filed trademark registrations for certain other names  including cows  and use other names for which we have not applied for registration 
we believe that our rights to these names are a significant part of our business and that our ability to create demand for our products is dependent to a large extent on our ability to exploit these trademarks 
our failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could negatively impact the value of our brand names 
we are applying for the international registration of all of our trademarks 
we are dependent on third party manufacturers and suppliers 
we are dependent on the ability of our manufacturers to adhere to our product  price and quality specifications and scheduling requirements 
our operations require us to have production orders in place in advance of shipment to our warehouses product deliveries typically take days 
any delay by manufacturers in supplying finished products to us would adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely and competitive basis 
in addition  raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products at our facilities  including flour  sugar  shortening  butter and flavorings  are purchased from third party suppliers 
we do not maintain agreements with any such suppliers and we are  therefore  subject to risks of periodic price fluctuations  shortages and delays 
if there is a material interruption in the availability or significant price increases for raw materials would have a material adverse effect on our operating margins 
we face various risks relating to foreign manufacturing 
during the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our products were manufactured in foreign countries 
we have been and will continue to be subject to risks associated with the manufacture of products in foreign countries  primarily in argentina  austria  belgium  china  holland and ireland 
these risks are material shipping delays  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  customs duties  tariffs and import quotas and international political  regulatory and economic developments 
we assume the risk of loss  damage or destruction of products when shipped by a manufacturer 
because we pay for some of our products manufactured outside the united states in foreign currencies  any weakening of the united states dollar in relation to relevant foreign currencies  could result in significantly increased costs to us 
in addition  some products manufactured overseas are subject to import duties 
deliveries of products from our foreign manufacturers could also be delayed or restricted by the future imposition of quotas 
if quotas were imposed  it is possible that we would not be able to obtain quality products at favorable prices from domestic or other suppliers whose quotas have not been exceeded by the supply of products to their existing customers

our operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of new product introductions  the timing of significant operating expenses and customer orders  delays in shipping orders  pricing and seasonality 
our sales increase during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year  due to the holidays that occur during those quarters 
during the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our annual sales occurred in the first two quarters of the fiscal year

these insurance amounts may not be sufficient to cover potential claims and adequate levels of coverage may not be available in the future at a reasonable cost 
in the event of a partially or completely uninsured successful claim against us  our financial condition and reputation would be materially affected 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success 
our success is dependent on the personal efforts of uziel frydman  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  amir frydman  our vice president of marketing and christopher willi  our chief financial officer

overview the company is engaged in the manufacture  marketing and distribution of a diverse line of brand name candies  cookies  chocolates and gifts 
through fiscal year ending july   the company had experienced continued revenue growth 
this growth was a direct result of the company s introduction of gift items  gift baskets and new candy products 
the new gift products enabled the company to expand its customer base to include mass merchandisers 
with net sales growing from approximately million in fiscal to over million in fiscal  management began to take steps to reduce costs in future years by consolidating operations and continuing to build its infrastructure 
the objective was to establish new production and assembly facilities with more efficient and effective cost structures 
the company began implementing these plans during the year ended july  in february  sherwood brands acquired some intellectual property and equipment from kr candy corporation  in brooklyn  new york  for  cash 
under the kastin brand name  the company continues to be a manufacturer of lollipops and jellies for the mass market 
the equipment was initially located in new york  but was subsequently moved in unison with the move of the rhode island manufacturing equipment down to the company s chase city  va manufacturing facility 
on may   sherwood acquisition merged with and into asher candy acquisition corporation  a wyoming corporation  with operations located in new hyde park  ny 
asher candy acquisition corporation is a manufacturer of candy canes and other hard candies under the asher name 
the surviving corporation of the merger is asher candy acquisition corporation  which has changed its name to asher candy  inc the company issued approximately  shares of its common stock valued at  to the shareholders of asher candy acquisition corporation in consideration for the transaction  subject to escrows for indemnification and adjustments based on a final audit  as well as warrants exercisable for sherwood brands common stock having a fair value of  asher candy generated no revenue from may  through july  during the year ended july   the company entered into six licensing agreements to incorporate its products into gift sets and to manufacturing of candies and wafers 
the royalty rates for such licenses are from to of net sales and expire in range of to years 
the products to be incorporated into the company s gift set items are primarily for the fourth quarter and easter selling season 
the company entered into a licensing agreement to produce everyday candies and wafers 
the company paid  in advance fees for the rights under the licensing agreements 
these advance fees will be offset against any amounts due on royalties 
there was no other minimum license fees under these agreements 
the company did incur minimum royalties during the year ended july  the company is currently pursuing other licenses with similar terms and conditions 
the company expects to see results from the agreements beginning in the year ending july   but the greatest impact will occur beginning in the year ending july  the company s rhode island manufacturing facility  which occupied five stories in an old building  closed on may  all the production equipment  together with the electrical  piping  steam and air conditioning were disassembled and transferred to the company s expanded chase city  va facility 
this  square feet facility  with an additional  square feet of new constructed building  and the  square foot facility at keysville  va about miles from chase city  va  will become a single manufacturing and distribution facility under one plant management for all products produced at the chase city facility 
while the plant is expected to be fully operational by november  the company anticipates that the transition period will result in decreased sales for seasonal merchandise for the quarter ending october  the company expects to regain these lost sales during the year ending july christmas  easter gift sets and gift baskets are distributed at the rhode island and massasusetts facilities 
the company sources product primarily from the pacific rim 
the company is continually looking to further reduce costs by more efficient sourcing 
environmental factors affecting the performance in the year ending july  after september   the total consumer market experienced a major slow down 
as a result major chains that ordered products from the company delayed their shipments  and kept inventory at the company s facilities 
the company was forced to hold inventory for these chains for a period of up to twelve months 
the company expects that all the held inventory will be shipped out by the end of the first quarter of or the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal ending january  
on september   west coast ports were shut down abruptly and remained closed as contract negotiations between dock workers and shipping companies broke off negotiations for new contracts 
the shut down occurred during the company s peak inventory shipping period for orders for the holiday season 
in mid october  the president of the united states of america signed an order under the taft hartley act to reopen the ports and put a moratorium on the strike for days 
the shut down will have an effect on our first quarter of shipments to our customers 
a large portion of containers  which were to be received  remained either at ports or on shipping vessels on the water 
in addition  empty containers were not brought back to ports in the pacific rim which we needed to move some of our other products 
in mid october  our inventory began to be released for shipment to our facility in new bedford  ma 
a slow down by the long shore men on shipping products is still prevalent 
the first quarter revenue numbers will be impacted by the shut down and may result in a delay of sales into the second quarter of approximately million
