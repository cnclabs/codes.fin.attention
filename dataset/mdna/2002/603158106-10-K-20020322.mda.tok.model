item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income and expense items as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold marketing and administrative expenses research and development expenses bad debt expenses write down of impaired assets restructuring charge income from operations net income overview of and outlook in  the company continued to experience weaknesses across all product lines primarily because of the difficult economic situation in the industries it serves paper  steel  construction and automotive 
the company expects the economic downturn that began in the second half of and continued throughout to continue into the first half of the company continues to be affected by negative factors in the industries the company serves three paper mills at which the company has satellite precipitated calcium carbonate pcc plants announced their intention to shut down 
these shutdowns are in addition to the three paper mill shutdowns disclosed in other paper makers reduced production as a result of weaker paper demand 
the domestic steel industry continued to deteriorate significantly in domestic steel production was at its lowest levels in decades and several steel manufacturers ceased operations and others filed for bankruptcy protection 
europe is anticipating a significant decline in steel production during the construction and automotive industries were also affected adversely by the weaker economy 
however  despite this difficult environment  the company was able to achieve low double digit operating margins 
this was accomplished through the restructuring plan announced in the second quarter of to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency  control of expenses  the synergies realized from recent acquisitions  and the continued development and commercialization of higher value products and technologies 
the company s operating margin as a percentage of sales declined to in as compared with in in  the company plans to continue its focus on the following growth strategies increase market penetration in the use of pcc in paper in both free sheet and groundwood mills 
increase penetration of pcc into the paper coating market 
emphasize higher value specialty products and application systems to increase market penetration in the refractories segment 
continue selective acquisitions to complement the company s existing businesses 
continue research and development and marketing efforts for new and existing products 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
the company began operations at one new satellite pcc plant at great northern paper  inc in millinocket  maine  in the third quarter of the satellite plant  which provides minerals technologies at pcc for filling groundwood specialty paper produced by great northern  is equivalent to two units 
at pcc  minerals technologies patented acid tolerant technology  permits the use of pcc  an alkaline material  in an acid papermaking environment 
the company also began operations in the first quarter of at an m real corporation paper mill in alizay  france 
this plant is equivalent to three units and is dedicated to the production of pcc products used in the filling of wood free printing and writing papers 
the company also added another five units of volume in through various expansions at existing satellite facilities 
a unit represents between  to  tons of pcc produced annually 
the company expects additional expansions at existing satellite pcc plants to occur in and also expects to sign contracts for new satellite pcc plants 
the company s sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term agreements  generally ten years in length  with paper mills at which the company operates satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a number of the company s customers to renew existing agreements on terms as favorable to the company as those currently in effect could cause the future growth rate of the company to differ materially from its historical growth rate  and could also result in impairment of the assets associated with the pcc plant 
several consolidations in the paper industry have taken place in the last two years 
these consolidations could result in partial or total closure of some paper mills at which the company operates pcc satellites 
such closures would reduce the company s sales of pcc  except to the extent that they resulted in paper production and associated purchases of pcc shifting to another location served by the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will occur 
in addition  such consolidations concentrate purchasing power in the hands of a smaller number of papermakers  enabling them to increase pressure on suppliers  such as the company 
this increased pressure could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
the company s largest customer  international paper company  decided to reduce production capacity by closing four paper mills at which the company has satellite pcc plants 
these paper mills are located in mobile  alabama  lock haven  pennsylvania  erie  pennsylvania  and oswego  new york 
in addition  two paper companies filed for bankruptcy protection and closed their paper mills in plainwell  michigan and anderson  california 
the company had satellite pcc plants at these locations 
excluding the plants to be closed  there are two satellite locations at which contracts with the host mill have recently expired 
the company continues to supply pcc at these locations and hopes to negotiate long term contract extensions at them 
there is no assurance  however  that these negotiations will be successful 
in may  the company announced that it would invest million in the construction of a new merchant facility in germany for the production of coating grade pcc 
this facility  which will have the capacity to manufacture approximately  tons of pcc a year  will produce pcc coating products for use in high quality publication and graphic art papers 
the company expects this facility to be in operation in on february   the company purchased from jm huber corporation a facility in hermalle sous huy  belgium that manufactures pcc 
this facility currently has the capacity to produce approximately  tons of pcc per year 
the company plans to modify the facility so that it is capable of producing opacarb pcc products  which are coating products used in high quality publication and graphic art papers 
this acquisition will allow the company to accelerate the development of its european coating pcc program 
the company also made the following acquisitions in the refractories segment in may  the company acquired the refractories business of martin marietta magnesia specialties inc this acquisition broadened the company s product line and significantly increased the volume of annual refractory sales 
it will also enable the company to be more cost effective through improved logistics  plant efficiencies  raw material sourcing  and benefits that will result from the company s research capabilities in the core monolithic refractories business 
in september  the company purchased all of the outstanding shares of rijnstaal bv  a netherlands based producer of cored metal wires used mainly in the steel and foundry industries 
rijnstaal has developed a middle market calcium containing cored metal wire that will complement the company s high end pferrocal lance injection system 
as the company continues to expand its operations overseas  it faces the inherent risks of doing business abroad  including inflation  fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates  changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  export and import restrictions  tariffs  nationalization  expropriation  limits on repatriation of funds  civil unrest  terrorism  unstable governments and legal systems  and other factors 
some of the company s operations are located in areas that have experienced political or economic instability  including indonesia  israel  china and south africa 
in addition  the company s performance depends to some extent on that of the industries it serves  particularly the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing  and construction industries 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension plan assumptions  income taxes  income tax valuation allowances and litigation and environmental liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that can not readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require it to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sale of products is recognized at the time the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in most of the company s pcc contracts  the price per ton is based upon the total number of tons sold to the customer during the year 
therefore  the price billed to the customer for shipments during the year is based on an estimate of the total annual volume that will be sold to such customer 
prices are adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the actual volume sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of the company s accounts receivable are due from companies in the paper  construction and steel industries 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
the company recorded bad debt expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
these charges were much higher than historical levels and were primarily related to bankruptcy filings by several of the company s major customers in the steel industry and to additional provisions associated with potential risks in the steel and other industries 
in addition to specific allowances established for bankrupt customers  the company also analyzes the collection history and financial condition of its other customers considering current industry conditions and determines whether an allowance needs to be established 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company s sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term arrangements  generally ten years in length  with paper mills at which the company operates satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
the company also continues to supply pcc to two locations at which the pcc contract has expired 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets can generate revenue  which does not necessarily coincide with the remaining term of a customer s contractual obligation for use of those assets 
failure of a pcc customer to renew an agreement or continue to purchase pcc from the company could result in an impairment of assets charge at such facility 
impairment losses have not been significant other than in however  three paper mills at which the company has operated satellite pcc plants have announced their intention to shut down 
in each case the company is exploring several possibilities  including continuing to operate the pcc plant if the host mill is sold to another paper manufacturer  operating the pcc plant on a merchant basis for sales to third parties  or transferring the equipment for use at another operation 
should these alternatives not be available  there could be impairment charges at one or more of these facilities  which the company estimates would not exceed million in the aggregate 
the company has a consolidated interest in two joint venture companies that operate satellite pcc plants at paper mills owned by subsidiaries of asia pulp paper app  one at perawang  indonesia  and one at dagang  china 
app is a multinational pulp and paper company whose current financial difficulties have been widely publicized 
while app is negotiating with its creditors  the perawang and dagang facilities have remained in operation at levels presently consistent with the prior year 
both mills are continuing to use mti s pcc and to satisfy their obligations to the joint ventures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s operations at these paper mills will not be adversely affected by app s financial difficulties in the future 
the company s net investment in these satellite plants was million at december  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  it measures any impairment by its ability to recover the carrying amount of the assets from expected future operating cash flow on a discounted basis 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within its consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent it establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of income 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations net sales dollars in millions growth growth net sales worldwide net sales in increased from the previous year to million

specialty minerals segment sales increased and refractories segment sales increased approximately in worldwide net sales of pcc in decreased approximately to million from million in the prior year 
the decrease in total pcc sales was primarily a result of a decline in sales of specialty pcc  which is used for non paper applications 
adverse market conditions and increased competitive pressure from lower cost ground calcium carbonate in the calcium supplement market were the primary reasons for the sales decrease 
this decrease was partially offset by a increase in paper pcc sales  which was primarily attributable to the commencement of operations at two new satellite pcc plants  the ramp up of two satellite plants that began operations in and expansions at several long standing pcc plants 
sales were adversely affected by consolidations  shutdowns and slowdowns in the paper industry 
excluding the effect of foreign exchange  pcc sales grew by percent in pcc sales in increased to million from million in this growth was primarily attributable to the start up of operations at two new satellite plants  the ramp up of two satellite plants that began operations in  and to volume increases and expansions at several long standing pcc plants

prospective information and factors that may affect future results the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand companies future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this report may contain forward looking statements that set out anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
words such as expects  plans  anticipates  will  and words and terms of similar substance  used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify these forward looking statements 
the company cannot guarantee that the outcomes suggested in any forward looking statement will be realized  although it believes it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and should refer to the discussion of certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions under the heading cautionary factors that may affect future results in item inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company 
the contracts pursuant to which the company constructs and operates its satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of the company s sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
these industries encountered difficulties in the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
for this reason  and because of the geographical diversification of our business  the company s operating results to date have not been materially affected by the difficult economic environment 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve 
there can be no assurance that a recession  in some markets or worldwide  would not have a significant negative effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   thereby eliminating the use of the pooling of interests method 
the company currently accounts for all acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after december   provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
this statement also requires an initial goodwill impairment assessment in the year of adoption and at least annual impairment tests thereafter 
effective july   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
and certain provisions of sfas no 
 as required for goodwill and other identifiable intangibles resulting from business combinations consummated after june  as of december   the company has unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million for the year ended december  the company does not expect that the remaining provisions of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after june   addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the company is currently analyzing this statement and has not yet determined its impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes a uniform accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the company does not expect adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
adoption of a common european currency as of january   twelve european countries adopted the euro as their common currency 
from that date until january   debtors and creditors could choose to pay or be paid in euros or in the former national currencies 
during  the affected national currencies ceased to be legal tender 
the company s information technology systems are now able to convert among the former national currencies and the euro and to process transactions and balances in euros 
the financial institutions with which the company does business were capable of receiving deposits and making payments both in euros and in the national currencies 
this did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company also reviewed contracts with customers and vendors calling for payments in currencies that were to be replaced by the euro  and intends to complete in a timely way any required changes to those contracts 
adoption of the euro is likely to have competitive effects in europe  as prices that had been stated in different national currencies become directly comparable to one another 
in addition  the adoption of a common monetary policy by the countries adopting the euro can be expected to have an effect on the economy of the region 
these competitive and economic effects had no material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operation during  and the company does not expect any such effect to occur 
there can be no assurance  however  that the transition to the euro will not have a material effect on the company s business in europe in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
it does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on its future earnings or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant decline in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial conditions and results of operations 
approximately of the company s bank debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore the company s results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to the short term bank debt outstanding 
an immediate percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations over the next fiscal year 
the company is exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  the company enters into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on the company s operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps would not subject the company to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  and liabilities and transactions being hedged 
the company had open forward exchange contracts to purchase million of foreign currencies as of december  these contracts mature on june  the fair value of these instruments was  at december  the company entered into three year interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million that expire in january these agreements effectively convert a portion of the company s floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
the fair value of these instruments was  at december
