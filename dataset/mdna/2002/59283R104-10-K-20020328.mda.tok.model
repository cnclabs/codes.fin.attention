costs and expenses 
costs of sales  consisting of food  beverage  liquor  supplies and paper costs  decreased as a percent of restaurant sales to compared with in fiscal the decrease was due  in part  to menu price increases  and due to menu design changes that removed low selling  high food cost items 
higher cheese prices offset some of this improvement 
labor and other related expenses decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales basis points to compared with in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to hourly and manager labor efficiency as a result of increasing same restaurant sales 
the improvement was also due to last year s closure of under performing restaurants

restaurant operating expenses  which primarily includes rent  property taxes  utilities  repair and maintenance  liquor taxes  property insurance  general liability insurance and advertising  increased as a percentage of restaurant sales to in fiscal year as compared with in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher utility  insurance and advertising costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total sales from of total sales in fiscal year to in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in corporate staffing that was offset by higher legal expenses relating to a parking easement lawsuit that was successfully concluded and severance expenses relating to the corporate staff decreases 
depreciation and amortization increased by to million 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of two new restaurants in october and june  four remodels during and six remodels during  as well as other fixed asset additions during fiscal year the closed restaurants mentioned above had relatively low book values of fixed assets so their closure did not significantly reduce depreciation 
no new restaurants were opened during the franchise restaurant acquired during fiscal year was an existing  operating restaurant that required no pre opening costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company expensed  related to restaurant closure and asset impairment costs 
these costs were due to the closure and sublease of three restaurants in boise  idaho and due to the impairment of the carrying value of previously closed restaurants that were sold or subleased just after the end of fiscal year there were no impairments recorded in fiscal year other income expense

the restaurant  which in had been sold and leased back from franchise finance of america ffca  was purchased back from ffca and then sold to a third party 
the restaurant was purchased with insurance proceeds after it was destroyed by fire 
the gain was primarily the realization of a deferred gain from the sale lease back transaction 
income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared with in fiscal year the lower rate is due to the effect of higher tax credits and favorable tax treatment on the closure of the boise  idaho restaurants

the decrease was due to other miscellaneous revenues decreasing as the company stopped selling certain merchandise items in the restaurants 
costs and expenses 
costs of sales  consisting of food  beverage  liquor  supplies and paper costs  decreased slightly as a percent of sales to compared with in fiscal the decrease was due to efforts with suppliers to generate costs savings coupled with a decrease in cheese prices 
these were offset by significant increases in the cost of beef  guacamole and tequila 
moderate price increases during the year also helped to keep costs down as a percent of sales 
labor and other related expenses increased basis points to compared with in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher labor costs associated with new store development  as well as the tight labor markets 
also  workers compensation and health insurance expenses increased on a comparable basis 
offsetting these increases were labor efficiencies within the restaurants that were opened during fiscal restaurant operating expenses increased to of restaurant sales compared with in fiscal the increase was due to a combination of higher utility costs  increased repairs and maintenance  increased property taxes and rent 
utility costs increased due to the higher energy costs 
older facilities contributed to the increased repairs 
the addition of the tortuga coastal cantina and la senorita restaurants and their related capital additions resulted in an increase in rental expense and property taxes 
general and administrative expenses decreased from of total sales in fiscal year to in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the absorption of general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
fiscal year also included  in write offs of site development costs 
depreciation and amortization increased by to million 
this increase is primarily due to the la senorita acquisition in may and capital additions during as five new restaurants were opened and nine restaurants were remodeled resulting in a full year s depreciation during fiscal year also during the year  two additional restaurants were opened and four were remodeled

other income and expense items decreased from a net expense of  to a net expense of  income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the lower rate is due to the effect of higher tax credits on lower income before taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the company met fiscal capital requirements with cash generated by operations 
in fiscal  the company s operations generated approximately million in cash  as compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of approximately million  compared with a working capital deficit of approximately million at december  the increase in fiscal year working capital deficit is primarily due to the reclassification of million of long term debt to short term debt 
a working capital deficit is common in the restaurant industry  since restaurant companies do not typically require a significant investment in either accounts receivable or inventory 
the company s principal capital requirements are the funding of new restaurant development or acquisitions and remodeling of older units 
during fiscal  capital expenditures on property  plant and equipment were approximately million as compared to approximately million for fiscal capital expenditures included the remodeling of six restaurants 
the company also exchanged a franchise note receivable for an existing  operating restaurant 
additionally  the company had cash outlays for necessary replacement of equipment and leasehold improvements in various older units 
there are no new restaurants planned for fiscal year the company does plan to modestly remodel five restaurants in fiscal year the estimated capital needed for fiscal year for general corporate purposes  including remodeling  is approximately million 
on june   the company re financed million of its debt with fleet national bank 
the new credit facility is for million 
the credit facility consists of a million term note that requires quarterly principal payments of  and matures on june  the credit facility also includes a million revolving line of credit that matures on june  the interest rate is either the prime rate or libor plus a stipulated percentage 
accordingly  the company is impacted by changes in the prime rate and libor 
the company is subject to a non use fee of on the unused portion of the revolver from the date of the credit agreement 
as of december   the company had million outstanding on the credit facility and is in full compliance with all debt covenants except the maximum capital expenditures covenant  which the company exceeded by  the company obtained a waiver for the fourth quarter non compliance and expects to be in compliance with the covenant in all quarters of fiscal year over the last several years  the company s debt was incurred to acquire monterey s acquisition corp  which was acquired on july  la senorita restaurants  which was acquired on april   to develop new restaurants  to remodel existing restaurants  as well as to accommodate other working capital needs 
the company anticipates that it will use excess cash flow during fiscal year to pay down debt approximately million 
the company s board of directors is considering a stock repurchase program 
such a program would be established in a manner permitted under the current bank financing agreement 
however  there is no assurance that any shares will actually be repurchased during fiscal year the company s management believes that with its operating cash flow and the company s revolving line of credit with fleet national bank  funds will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and to finance routine capital expenditures and remodels through the end of the fiscal year 
unless the company violates an important debt covenant  the company s credit facility with fleet national bank is not subject to triggering events that would cause the credit facility to become due sooner than the maturity dates described in the previous paragraph 
risk factors the company cautions readers that its business is subject to a number of risks  any of which could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made from time to time in releases  including this form k  and oral statements 
certain risk factors have been presented throughout this document  including  among others  expansion strategy  site selection  attracting and retaining franchisees  managers and other employees  availability of food products  competition and government regulation 
certain other risks to which the company is subject include seasonality 
the company s sales and earnings fluctuate seasonally 
historically the company s highest sales and earnings have occurred in the second and third calendar quarters  which the company believes is typical of the restaurant industry and consumer spending patterns in general with respect to the third quarter and is due to increased holiday traffic at the company s mall restaurants for the fourth quarter 
in addition  quarterly results have been and  in the future are likely to be  substantially affected by the timing of new restaurant openings 
because of the seasonality of the company s business and the impact of new restaurant openings  results for any calendar quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year and cannot be used to indicate financial performance for the entire year 
impact of inflation market risks 
the company believes that inflation has impacted net income during fiscal year substantial increases in utility expenses and insurance premiums had a marked impact on the company s operating results to the extent such increases could not be passed along to customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience the same inflationary impact in the future 
if operating expenses increase  management intends to attempt to recover increased costs by increasing prices to the extent deemed advisable considering competitive conditions 
the company does not have or participate in transactions involving derivative  financial and commodity instruments 
accelerating growth strategy 
the company s ability to expand by adding company owned and franchised restaurants will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable locations  the ability to hire  train and retain an adequate number of experienced management and hourly employees  the availability of acceptable lease terms and adequate financing  timely construction of restaurants  the ability to obtain various government permits and licenses and other factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company and its franchisees 
the opening of additional franchised restaurants will depend  in part  upon the ability of existing and future franchisees to obtain financing or investment capital adequate to meet their market development obligations 
based on the company s experience in attempting to grow outside its existing markets  the company has found there can be limited consumer acceptance and that the cost of such efforts can have a materially adverse impact on the company s financial results 
small restaurant base and geographic concentration 
the results achieved to date by the company s relatively small restaurant base may not be indicative of the results of a larger number of restaurants in a more geographically dispersed area 
because of the company s relatively small restaurant base  an unsuccessful new restaurant could have a more significant effect on the company s results of operations than would be the case in a company owning more restaurants 
additionally  given the company s present geographic concentration all company owned units are currently in texas  oklahoma and michigan  results of operations may be adversely affected by economic or other conditions in the region and adverse publicity relating to the company s restaurants could have a more pronounced adverse effect on the company s overall sales than might be the case if the company s restaurants were more broadly dispersed
