item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition this discussion should be read in conjunction with dura s consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview the economic climate has been extremely challenging in this was especially true in the automotive and recreational vehicle markets 
we saw significantly lower production levels in north america during as compared to the automotive market experienced a boost in the second half of as a result of the various incentive plans that the oems established including zero percent financing  but production levels were still reduced compared to because most of the demand was met from the sale of existing inventory 
as such  our sales have declined in line with the reduced north american oem production volumes 
we anticipate that will continue to be a challenging environment and we believe that our ability to reduce costs and deliver quality products has prepared us for the conditions this uncertain market may present to us 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to  million from  million for factors that unfavorably impacted revenue in included the weakness in both the north american automotive and recreational vehicle markets as well as the weakening of the european currencies in relation to the us dollar

cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to  million from  million for cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  was compared to for the corresponding reduction in gross margin is primarily the result of the decreased volumes in the north american automotive and recreational vehicle markets as well as inefficiencies resulting from a few difficult product launches in europe

dura has recorded a non cash charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of for the estimated loss upon divestment 
throughout and dura has evaluated manufacturing capacity issues and opportunities for cost reduction given the reduced demand in the north america automotive and recreational vehicle markets and the available capacity within dura s operations 
as a result  beginning in the fourth quarter of  dura began to implement several actions including discontinuing operations in two north american facilities  combining the driver control and engineered products divisions into one  control systems  and reducing and consolidating certain support activities to achieve an appropriate level of support personnel relative to remaining operations and future business requirements

amortization expense 
amortization expense for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million in the slight decrease is due to the impact of foreign exchange on european goodwill during interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million in the decrease in interest expense is due to lower interest rates on libor contracts and debt pay down of approximately million during  offset by the higher interest cost related to the additional issuance of million of senior subordinated notes see below and the unfavorable impact of existing interest rate swap agreements 
income taxes

under sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives  but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  effective january   dura adopted sfas no 
with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july  dura is in the process of determining the impact of adopting sfas no 
on its earnings and financial position  including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
application of the provisions of sfas no 
are anticipated to result in an increase in pre tax net income of approximately million for the year ended december   related to the goodwill amortization that will no longer be recorded under sfas no 
effective january   dura adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes 
the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
was to increase other comprehensive income oci by million  after tax 
the effect on net income was not significant  primarily because the hedges in place as of january  qualified for hedge accounting treatment and were highly effective 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to  million from  million for the increase is primarily the result of the full year effect of the acquisitions of excel and adwest in march of  metallifacture in june of and the seat track business of meritor in november factors that unfavorably impacted revenue in included the weakening of the european currencies in relation to the us dollar and the weakness in the recreational vehicle market

the effective rates differ from statutory rates due primarily to the mix in income among the countries in which dura operates and the effect of the non deductible goodwill amortization  offset by favorable foreign sales corporation and research and development credits 
minority interest and equity in losses of affiliates 
for the year ended december   minority interest in income represents a partial year of a minority interest in dura s fully consolidated subsidiary in wales 
the minority interest was acquired during and at december  was wholly owned 
the equity in losses of affiliates for year ended december  is less significant in compared to as a result of dura increasing its ownership interest in these investments during  resulting in consolidation of the entities  as well as operating improvements implemented which resulted in a positive impact on earnings

the extraordinary loss for the year ended december  represents the write off  net of income taxes  of deferred financing costs related to dura s former credit facilities 
cumulative effects of change in accounting 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting for the year ended december  represents the write off  net of income taxes  of the unamortized balance of capitalized start up costs pursuant to the provisions of sop liquidity and capital resources during  dura provided cash from operations of million  compared to million in cash generated from operations before changes in working capital items was million for compared to million for working capital generated cash of million in compared to requiring million in the improvement in working capital is primarily the result of dura s continued focus on reducing accounts receivable and inventory levels during net cash used in investing activities was million for as compared to million in net capital expenditures totaled million for primarily for equipment and dedicated tooling purchases related to new or replacement programs 
this compares with net capital expenditures of million in net cash used in financing activities totaled million for compared with cash provided of million in during  dura issued an additional million  net of issuance costs and discounts  of senior subordinated notes see below  and used the proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
in connection with the acquisitions of adwest and excel  dura entered into an amended and restated billion credit agreement credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for revolving credit facilities of million  a million tranche a term loan  a million tranche b term loan and a million interim term loan facility 
as of december   rates on borrowings under the credit agreement ranged from to 
borrowings under the tranche a term loan are due and payable in march and borrowings under the tranche b term loan are due and payable in march the revolving credit facility is available until march borrowings under the interim loan were repaid in april the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants that limit indebtedness  investments  rental obligations and cash dividends 
the credit agreement also requires dura to maintain certain financial ratios including minimum liquidity and interest coverage 
dura was in compliance with the covenants as of december  borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all assets of dura 
the credit agreement provides dura with the ability to denominate a portion of its revolving credit borrowings in foreign currencies up to an amount equal to million 
as of december   million of borrowings were denominated in us dollars  million in british pound sterling and million in euros 
at december   dura had unused borrowing capacity of approximately million of which million was available under its most restrictive debt covenant 
dura also utilizes uncommitted overdraft facilities to satisfy the short term working capital requirements of its foreign subsidiaries 
at december   dura had unsecured overdraft facilities outstanding of million  which is included in current maturities of long term debt on the balance sheet 
at december   dura had unsecured overdraft facilities available from banks of approximately million 
the average interest rates on the outstanding overdraft facilities at december  was approximately 
dura believes the borrowing availability under its credit agreement  uncommitted overdraft facilities and funds generated by operations  should provide liquidity and capital resources to pursue its business strategy for the foreseeable future  with respect to working capital  capital expenditures  and other operating needs 
dura estimates its capital expenditures will not exceed million 
in april  dura completed the offering of million and euro million of senior subordinated notes subordinated notes 
the subordinated notes mature in may and bear interest at per year  which is payable semi annually 
net proceeds from this offering of approximately million were used to repay the million interim term loan  approximately million to retire other indebtedness and approximately million will be used for general corporate purposes 
in june  dura completed a similar offering of senior subordinated notes due may with a face amount of million 
the interest on these notes is also payable semi annually 
unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were million  yielding an imputed interest rate of 
net proceeds of approximately million were used to reduce the borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
these notes are collateralized by guarantees of certain of dura s subsidiaries 
dura is limited as to its ability to declare or make certain dividend payments or other distributions of assets under its credit agreement and subordinated notes 
certain distributions relating to items such as  a company stock purchase program  tax sharing arrangements and as required under dura s trust preferred securities are permitted 
in connection with the termination of a former credit facility  dura wrote off deferred financing costs of approximately million  net of income taxes during the first quarter of in addition  dura wrote off costs of approximately million  net of income taxes  related to the tender of the million of trident s outstanding senior subordinated notes due during the second quarter of these charges are reflected as extraordinary items in the accompanying statement of operations 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgement by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
dura recognizes revenue as its products are shipped to its customers 
dura enters into agreements with its customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s life to produce products 
once such agreements are entered into by dura  fulfillment of the customers purchasing requirements is the obligation of dura for the entire production life of the vehicle  with terms of up to seven years  and dura has no provisions to terminate such contracts 
in certain instances  dura may be committed under existing agreements to supply product to its customers at selling prices that are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such product 
in such situations  dura records a liability for the estimated future amount of such losses 
such losses are recognized at the time that the loss is probable and reasonably estimable and is recorded at the minimum amount necessary to fulfill dura s obligations to its customers 
dura utilizes certain estimates when calculating its required loss reserves 
these estimates include production volumes for particular models  future pricing agreed to with customers and dura s ability to achieve planned cost savings 
we adjust our reserves as events occur that impact our estimates 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and has been amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in assessing the recoverability of dura s goodwill and other intangibles dura must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  dura may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on january  dura adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
during the year ended december   dura did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  the effects of these adjustments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality dura typically experiences decreased revenues and operating income during the third calendar quarter of each year due to production shutdowns at oems for model changeovers and vacations 
the recreational vehicle market is seasonal in that sales in the fourth quarter are normally at reduced levels 
effects of inflation inflation potentially affects dura in two principal ways 
first  a significant portion of dura s debt is tied to prevailing short term interest rates which may change as a result of inflation rates  translating into changes in interest expense 
second  general inflation can impact material purchases  labor and other costs 
in many cases  dura has limited ability to pass through inflation related cost increases due to the competitive nature of the markets that dura serves 
in the past few years  however  inflation has not been a significant factor 
market risk dura is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
dura does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
dura enters into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
dura manages its interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed and variable debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december  giving effect to the interest rate swaps discussed below  dura had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have changed the fair market value of dura s debt at december  by approximately million and would be expected to have an estimated impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next year of approximately million 
at december   dura had outstanding interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted million of its credit agreement borrowings into a fixed rate obligation 
under these swap agreements  which expire at various dates through april   dura receives payments at variable rates  while it makes payments at fixed rates to at december  
the net interest paid or received is included in interest expense 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a net loss position for dura of approximately million  net of tax  representing the estimated cost that would be incurred to terminate the agreements  and is included in other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated december  statement of stockholders investment 
the swap agreements were designated at their inception as an interest rate hedge 
dura also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure related to the interest payments under its outstanding million euro denominated senior subordinated notes 
dura designated these contracts at their inception as a cash flow hedge 
at december   dura had outstanding contracts to purchase million euro approximately million  representing the interest payments due during the estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts based upon market quotes was approximately million 
the net realized gain of approximately million is included in other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated december  statement of stockholders investment 
the counter parties to the above agreements are major financial institutions 
dura does not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency transactions a significant portion of dura s revenues during the year ended december  were derived from manufacturing operations in europe  canada and latin america 
the results of operations and the financial position of dura s operations in these countries are principally measured in their respective currency and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in such countries are somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currencies in which revenues are generated 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
a significant portion of dura s assets at december  are based in its foreign operations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of stockholders investment 
accordingly  dura s consolidated stockholders investment will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
dura s strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily upon conducting its operations in such countries respective currency and dura may  from time to time  engage in hedging programs intended to reduce dura s exposure to currency fluctuations see discussion above on market risk
