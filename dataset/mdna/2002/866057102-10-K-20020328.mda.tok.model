increases in other income also contributed to the higher net income in  offset somewhat by increases in other expenses 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid for the liabilities used to support those assets 
it is the largest component of the company s earnings and changes in net interest income have the greatest impact on net income 
variations in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and their relative sensitivity to interest rate movements determine changes in net interest income

    interest income interest income for was million  which was an increase of  or  over the million for interest income for was million 
the increases each year are primarily a result of the higher levels of earning assets which averaged million  million and million in  and  respectively 
changes in average yield on earning assets also affect the interest income reported each year 
the average yield  on a fully tax equivalent basis  increased from in to in  and decreased to in due primarily to fluctuations in the general interest rate environment during the three year period 
the majority of the increase in average earning assets between and and between and was in loans  the company s highest yielding assets  which accounted for of average earning assets for consolidated loans averaged million in with an average yield of  compared to million in with an average yield of  and million in with an average yield of 
in excess of of the company s loan portfolio adjusts immediately with changes in the prime lending rate 
the prime rate increased from an average of in to average in resulting in increases in the average yield on loans in the average loan rate dropped in as compared to the prior year as a direct result of the basis point decline in the average prime rate to for the year 
the higher level of average loans each year  combined with the effect of fluctuations in average yield  resulted in increases in interest income on loans of million  or  between and and  or  between and the second largest component of earning assets is the company s investment portfolio which averaged million yielding in this is compared to average securities of million in yielding  and million yielding for the fluctuations in the average yield of the investment portfolio each year is related to the timing  maturity distribution and types of securities purchased  called and matured  combined with fluctuations in the general interest rate environment 
the increase in average securities  offset somewhat by the basis point decrease in average rate  resulted in an increase in interest income on investments of  or  between and higher levels of average investments  combined with a higher average rate  resulted in an increase in interest income on investments of  or  between and interest expense the company s interest expense for was million  compared to million for and million for the increase in interest expense in was related to the increase in average interest bearing liabilities  offset by the basis point decrease in the cost of funds 
the increase in the interest expense in from was a result of the increase in average interest bearing liabilities combined with the basis point increase in the cost of funds 
the lower average cost of funds in was a direct result of the declining interest rates throughout the year combined with the maturity of cds renewed at lower current market rates 
interest bearing liabilities averaged million in with an average rate of  compared to million in with an average rate of  and an average of million with an average rate of during interest rate sensitivity analysis an important aspect of achieving satisfactory levels of net income is the management of the composition and maturities of rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to optimize net interest income as interest rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities fluctuate from time to time 
the interest sensitivity gap the gap is the difference between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities in a given time period 
the gap provides an indication of the extent to which the company s net interest income may be affected by interest rate movements 
the objective of interest sensitivity management is to maintain reasonably stable growth in net interest income despite changes in market interest rates by maintaining the proper mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
management seeks to maintain a general equilibrium between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to insulate net interest income from significant adverse changes in market rates 
at december   on a cumulative basis through months  rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  resulting in a month period liability sensitive position at the end of of million 
when the effective change ratio the historical relative movement of each asset s and liability s rates in relation to a basis point change in the prime rate is applied to the interest gap position  the company is actually in an asset sensitive position over a month period and the entire repricing lives of the assets and liabilities 
this is primarily due to the fact that over of the loan portfolio moves immediately on a one to one ratio with a change in the prime rate  while the deposit accounts do not increase or decrease as much relative to a prime rate movement 
the following table presents a measure  in a number of time frames  of the interest sensitivity gap by subtracting interest sensitive liabilities from interest sensitive assets

at december   approximately of the company s interest earning assets reprice or mature within one year  as compared to approximately of the interest bearing liabilities 
asset liability management is the process by which the company monitors and controls the mix and maturities of its assets and liabilities 
the essential purposes of asset liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the bank has established an asset liability management committee which uses a variety of tools to analyze interest rate sensitivity  including a static gap presentation and a simulation model 
a static gap presentation as in the above table reflects the difference between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities within certain time periods 
while the static gap is a widely used measure of interest sensitivity  it is not  in management s opinion  a true indicator of a company s sensitivity position 
it presents a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of savings and core time deposits may contractually change within a relatively short time frame  but those rates are significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
accordingly  a liability sensitive gap position is not as indicative of a company s true interest sensitivity as would be the case for an organization which depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets 
net interest income would also be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including the spread between the prime rate and the incremental borrowing cost and the volume and mix of earning asset growth 
accordingly  the bank uses a simulation model  among other techniques  to assist in achieving consistent growth in net interest income while managing interest rate risk 
the model takes into account interest rate changes as well as changes in the mix and volume of assets and liabilities 
the model simulates the company s balance sheet and income statement under several different rate scenarios 
the model s inputs such as interest rates and levels of loans and deposits are updated as necessary throughout the year in order to maintain a current forecast as assumptions change 
the forecast presents information over a month period 
it reports a base case in which interest rates remain flat and reports variations that occur when rates increase and decrease basis points 
according to the model  the company is presently positioned so that net interest income will increase in the short term if interest rates rise and will decrease in the short term if interest rates decline 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was  in   in  and  in the change in the provision each year is primarily related to the level of net originations in each year as follows million in  million in  and million in as discussed further below under the allowance for loan losses section  other factors influencing the amount charged to the provision each year include trends in and the total amount of past due  classified and nonperforming loans  concentrations of credit risk in the loan portfolio  local and national economic conditions and anticipated trends  and the total outstanding loans and charge off activity of the finance company which have higher inherent risk than do loans of the bank 
thus  contributing to the higher provision in was the increase in nonperforming assets from of gross loans at december  to of gross loans at the year end  as well as the general economic uncertainty throughout estimates charged to the provision for loan losses are based on management s judgment as to the amount required to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio and are adjusted as necessary 
noninterest income and expenses noninterest income increased  or  in  to million from million in and million in insurance commission fee income rose to  in from  in and  in  primarily related to the volume of annuity product sales made by the bank s nondeposit investment sales subsidiary 
credit card fees and income rose to  in from  in and  in these increases are related to the higher volume of transactions and merchant activity in the bank s credit card portfolio each year 
the higher amount in service charges and fees on deposit accounts  which increased in to  from  in and  in  is related to the increases in the transaction fees and the higher number of bank deposit accounts and transactions subject to service charges and fees each year 
the higher level of gain on sales of investment securities totaling  for is related to the increase in volume of investment sales from the company s available for sale investment portfolio during the year 
increases in the line item  other income  which was up  or in and  in  is primarily related to the higher level of mortgage and other loan referrals and loan late fees which increased  in and decreased  between and  and the higher level of mutual fund and brokerage activity in the bank s nondeposit financial services subsidiary which resulted in higher income of  in and  in other fluctuations are related to the level of activity and transactions of the bank generating other income in the normal course of business 
total noninterest expenses were million in  million in  and million in a majority of the increased expenditures each year reflects the cost of additional personnel hired to support the company s growth and the new bank branch opened in the second quarter of the most significant item included in noninterest expenses is salaries  wages and benefits which amounted to million in  million in  and million in the increase of  or in was a result of normal annual raises and replacement of staff  a full year in of new branch staff  including three officers  added in september  and increases in benefit plan costs including group health insurance premiums and k deferral matches related to higher salaries 
the increase of  in was a result of normal annual raises  increases in bonuses and incentive plan calculations and payments  and additional branch staff added primarily related to the new branch location during occupancy and furniture  fixtures  and equipment expenses increased  or  to million in from million in and increased  from million in increases each year are related primarily to the expenses associated with new branch facilities 
increases in are somewhat offset by lower expense on fully depreciated assets 
included in the line item other expenses  which increased  or  between and and decreased  or  between and  are charges for advertising and public relations  insurance claims and premiums  printing and office support  credit card expenses  legal and professional services  and other branch and customer related expenses 
a majority of these items are related directly to the normal operations of the bank and fluctuate in relation to the increase in assets  the higher level of transaction volume  and the larger number of customer accounts 
the most significant increases in relate to higher advertising for the new branch opening  higher volume of transactions and deconversion fee on the credit card portfolio  increases in legal and consultant expenses related to loan collections and security audits  and higher branch related expenses due to a full year with an additional facility 
the reduction in is primarily related to the bank s expenses returning to a normal level after additional expenses were incurred in related to higher repossession and collection costs  advertising expenses associated with marketing new internet banking products  and yk preparation expenses 
income taxes the company recorded an income tax provision of million  million  and  in   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in each year was   and  respectively 
the change in effective rate each year is primarily related to fluctuations in the level of tax free municipal investments

    allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through charges in the form of a provision for loan losses based on management s periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio 
loan losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance 
the amount of the allowance reflects management s opinion of an adequate level to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at december  the amount charged to the provision and the level of the allowance is based on management s judgment and is dependent upon growth in the loan portfolio  the total amount of past due loans and nonperforming loans  known loan deteriorations  and concentrations of credit 
other factors affecting the allowance are trends in portfolio volume  maturity and composition  collateral values  and general economic conditions 
finally  management s assessment of probable losses based upon internal credit grading of the loans and periodic reviews and assessments of credit risk associated with particular loans is considered in establishing the allowance amount 
the company considers its policies regarding the allowance for loan losses to be its most critical accounting policy due to the significant degree of management judgment involved 
management maintains an allowance for loan losses which it believes adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio 
it must be emphasized  however  that the determination of the allowance for loan losses using the company s procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about future economic conditions  events  and other factors affecting loans which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
while it is the company s policy to provide for the loan losses in the current period in which a loss is considered probable  there are additional risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because these risks include the state of the economy  industry trends  and conditions affecting individual borrowers  management s judgment of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period sustain loan losses which would be sizable in relationship to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluation of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
the allowance for loan losses is also subject to review by various regulatory agencies through their periodic examinations of the company s subsidiaries 
such examination could result in required changes to the allowance for loan losses 
no adjustment in the allowance or significant adjustments to the bank s internal classified loans were made as a result of the bank s most recent examination performed by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  management relies predominately on its ongoing review of the loan portfolio  which is undertaken both to ascertain whether there are losses which must be charged off and to assess the risk characteristics of the portfolio in the aggregate 
the bank attempts to deal with credit risks through the establishment of  and adherence to  internal credit policies 
these policies include loan officer and credit limits  periodic documentation examination  and follow up procedures for any exceptions to credit policies 
loans that are determined to involve any more than the normal risk are placed in a special review status 
the company s methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses incorporates management s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio through a disciplined and consistently applied process 
the methodology includes segmentation of the loan portfolio into reasonable components for calculation of the most accurate possible reserve 
the loan portfolio is grouped into commercial real estate  residential mortgages  construction  commercial and industrial  and consumer loans 
the loan segments are further grouped into performing loans  past due loans  nonaccrual loans  internally classified loans and loans considered impaired 
appropriate reserve estimates are determined for each segment based on a review of individual loans  application of historical loss factors for each segment  and adjustment factors applied as considered necessary 
the adjustment factors are applied consistently and are quantified for consideration of national and local economic conditions  exposure to concentrations that may exist in the portfolio  impact of off balance sheet risk  alterations of lending policies and procedures  changes in trends of past due loans  problem loans and charge offs  variations in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  modification of director oversight  entry into new markets  and other factors which may impact the current credit quality of the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of total loans  at the end of this is compared to a million allowance  or of total loans  at december  for the year ended december   the company reported net charge offs of  or of consolidated average loans 
this is compared to consolidated net charge offs of  or of average loans  for the year ended december  the table below presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses for each of the years ended december by the different loan categories

at december   the carrying value of loans that are considered to be impaired under sfas totaled  which includes the  non accrual loan 
there were no impaired loans at december for any other year presented 
the average balance of impaired loans was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
there was no impairment allowance required at either year end 
the amount of foregone interest income that would have been recorded on non accrual loans had these loans performed according to their contractual terms amounted to approximately  and  during and  respectively 
interest income recognized on non accrual and impaired loans was approximately  and  during and  respectively 
management maintains a list of potential problem loans which includes nonaccrual loans  loans past due in excess of days which are still accruing interest  and other loans which are credit graded either internally  by external audits or regulatory examinations as substandard  doubtful  or loss 
a loan is added to the list when management becomes aware of information about possible credit problems of borrowers that causes doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the current loan repayment terms 
the total amount of loans outstanding at december  determined to be potential problem loans based upon management s internal designations  was million or of the loan portfolio at year end  compared to million or of the loan portfolio at december  the amount of potential problem loans at december  does not represent management s estimate of potential losses since the majority of such loans are considered adequately secured by real estate or other collateral 
the increase in the amount of classified loans in is primarily related to the deterioration of general economic conditions during and management s proactive approach to more closely monitor credits 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate to absorb any losses related to the nonperforming loans and problem loans as of that date 
management continues to monitor closely the levels on nonperforming and problem loans and will address the weaknesses in these credits to enhance the amount of ultimate collection or recovery on these assets 
should increases in the overall level of nonperforming and potential problem loans accelerate from the current trend  management will adjust the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and will increase the provision for loan losses accordingly 
this would likely decrease net income

liquidity liquidity management involves meeting the cash flow requirements of the company 
the company must maintain an adequate liquidity position in order to respond to the short term demand for funds caused by withdrawals from deposit accounts  maturities of other borrowings  extensions of credit  and for the payment of operating expenses 
maintaining an adequate level of liquidity is accomplished through a combination of liquid assets  assets which can easily be converted into cash  and access to additional sources of funds 
the company s primary liquid assets are cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  unpledged investment securities available for sale  other short term investments and maturing loans 
these primary liquidity sources accounted for of average assets exclusive of cash flows on loans for each of the years ended december  and in management s opinion  the company maintains adequate levels of liquidity by retaining sufficient liquid assets and assets which can be easily converted into cash and by maintaining access to various sources of funds 
the primary sources of funds available through the bank include advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb  purchasing federal funds from other financial institutions  lines of credit through the federal reserve bank  and increasing deposits by raising rates paid 
at december   based on eligible collateral available  the bank had additional available credit of approximately million from the fhlb 
further  the bank had short term lines of credit to purchase unsecured federal funds from unrelated correspondent banks with available balances of million at december  summit financial  the parent holding company  has limited liquidity needs 
the company requires liquidity to pay limited operating expenses and to provide funding to its consumer finance subsidiary  freedom finance 
summit financial has approximately million in available liquidity remaining from its initial public offering and the retention of earnings 
a total of million of this liquidity was advanced to the finance company  in the form of an intercompany loan  to fund its operations as of december  additional sources of liquidity for summit financial include borrowing funds from unrelated correspondent banks  borrowing from individuals  and payments for management fees and debt service which are made by the company s subsidiary on a monthly basis 
liquidity needs of freedom finance  primarily for the funding of loan originations  paying operating expenses  and servicing debt  have been met to date through the initial capital investment of  made by summit financial  borrowings from an unrelated private investor  and line of credit facilities provided by summit financial and summit national bank 
the company s management believes its liquidity sources are adequate to meet its operating needs and does not know of any trends  events or uncertainties that may result in a significant adverse affect on the company s liquidity position 
off balance sheet commitments the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december  the company s commitments to extend additional credit totaled approximately million  of which approximately million represents commitments to extend credit at fixed rates of interest 
commitments to extend credit at fixed rates expose the company to some degree of interest rate risk 
included in the company s total commitments are standby letters of credit 
letters of credit are commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and totaled million at december  the credit risk involved in the underwriting of letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measurement of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars  without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most other industries  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect in a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation 
the yield on a majority of the company s earning assets adjusts simultaneously with changes in the general level of interest rates 
approximately of the company s interest bearing liabilities at december  had been issued with fixed terms and can be repriced only at maturity 
during periods of declining interest rates  as experienced through  the company s assets reprice faster than the supporting liabilities 
this causes a decrease in the short term in the net interest margin until the fixed rate deposits mature and are repriced at then lower current market rates  thus narrowing the difference between what the company earns on its assets and what it pays on its liabilities 
given the company s current balance sheet structure  the opposite effect that is  an increase in net interest income is realized in the short term in a rising rate environment 
accounting  reporting and regulatory matters statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities 
they require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position  and measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of those derivatives will be reported in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the use of the derivative and whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting 
the company adopted sfas  as amended by sfas  on january  the adoption was not material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb no 
 was issued in september it revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures but carries over most of the provisions of sfas without reconsideration 
sfas is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities occurring after march  this statement is effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures related to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of the provisions of sfas on april  did not have a material effect on the company 
in july  sfas  business combinations and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets were issued 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also specifies criteria which intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company was required to adopt the provisions of sfas immediately and has adopted sfas effective january  sfas requires that upon adoption of sfas  the company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in any prior purchase business combination and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas  the company was required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles in the first interim period 
in connection with sfas s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement requires the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value and the fair value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of operations 
management does not anticipate that the adoption of the provisions of sfas will have a material effect on the company 
in august  sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impaiment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of sfas the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company will adopt sfas on january  and does not anticipate any material effect on the company 
interest rate sensitivity achieving consistent growth in net interest income  which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates  is the primary goal of the company s asset liability function 
the company attempts to control the mix and maturities of assets and liabilities to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings and to achieve consistent growth in net interest income  while maintaining adequate liquidity and capital 
a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company s asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect of interest rates moving in either direction is not expected to be significant over time 
the company s asset liability committee alco uses a simulation model  among other techniques  to assist in achieving consistent growth in net interest income while managing interest rate risk 
the model takes into account  over a month period or longer if necessary  assumed interest rate changes as well as assumed changes in the mix and volume of assets and liabilities 
the model simulates the company s balance sheet and income statement under several different rate scenarios and rate shocks 
the model s inputs such as interest rates and levels of loans and deposits are updated as necessary throughout the year in order to maintain a current forecast as assumptions change 
according to the model  the company is presently positioned so that net interest income will increase in the short term if interest rates rise and will decrease in the short term if interest rates decline 
the company also uses interest rate sensitivity gap analysis to monitor the relationship between the maturity and repricing of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period 
the static interest sensitivity gap position  while not a complete measure of interest sensitivity  is reviewed periodically to provide insights related to static repricing structure of assets and liabilities 
at december   on a cumulative basis through months  rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  resulting in a month period liability sensitive position of approximately million 
when the effective change ratio the historical relative movement of each asset s and liability s rates in relation to a basis point change in the prime rate is applied to the interest gap position  the company is actually asset sensitive over a month period and the entire repricing lives of the assets and liabilities 
this is primarily due to the fact that in excess of of the loan portfolio moves immediately on a one to one ratio with a change in the prime lending rate  while the deposit rates do not increase or decrease as much relative to a prime rate movement 
the company s asset sensitive position means that assets reprice faster than the liabilities  which generally results in short term increases in the net interest income during periods of rising rates and short term decreases in net interest income when market rates decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investing  deposit gathering and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the company manages other risks  including credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk and it could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
other types of market risks  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the bank s alco monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income 
net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items over a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
a primary purpose of the company s asset and liability management is to manage interest rate risk to effectively invest the company s capital and to preserve the value created by its core business operations 
as such  certain management monitoring processes are designed to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a periodic basis by the board of directors and the alco which is charged with the responsibility to maintain the level of sensitivity of the company s net portfolio value within board approved limits 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis by computing estimated changes in npv of its cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained basis points increase or decrease in the market interest rates 
the company s board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes maximum allowable decreases in npv in the event of a sudden and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates 
the following table presents the company s projected change in npv for the various rate shock levels as of year end
