item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of operating results covers each of the company s business segments for the years ended december   and management believes that a segment analysis provides the most effective means of understanding the business 
as discussed in note n to the consolidated financial statements  segment data are reported using the accounting policies followed by the company for internal reporting to management 
these policies are the same as those used for external reporting 
operating results of the segments are reconciled to earnings from operations in the financial statements in note n 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to the evaluation of impairment of long lived assets and the collectibility of notes and accounts receivable 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an operating property to be held and used or land held for development may be impaired  a recoverability analysis is performed based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the property in the future 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the property is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
if we decide to sell an operating property or land held for development  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell and an impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of cash flows and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
our estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and our assessments of them change 
the allowance for doubtful notes and accounts receivable is established based on analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant or other debtor  the financial condition of the tenant and our assessment of its ability to meet its lease obligations  the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations  etc 
our estimate of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on our tenants 
operating results shopping centers the operating results of shopping center properties are affected significantly by acquisition and disposition transactions and openings of newly developed or redeveloped properties 
information related to shopping center acquisitions and developments redevelopments completed during  and is summarized in the following table property transaction or opening date acquisitions pottstown plaza shopping center october fullerton plaza shopping center march stonehedge square shopping center february saucon valley square shopping center march development redevelopment waverly woods shopping center march security square shopping center february burke town plaza shopping center december glen burnie village shopping center november rosedale plaza shopping center august harford mall december arundel plaza shopping center march item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating results of shopping center properties are summarized as follows in thousands revenues    operating and interest expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization    depreciation and amortization    minority interest    earnings from operations    revenues from shopping centers increased by  in and by  in the increase in was due primarily to the operations of the newly developed properties opened in  properties acquired in and  the redevelopment projects completed and opened in  and other net rental and occupancy changes

operating results all other properties operating results of all other properties are summarized as follows in thousands revenues    operating and interest expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization minority interest earnings from operations there were no significant changes in the operating results of all other properties during the period 
gain loss on properties the gain on properties for is due to the sale of land located in burlington  north carolina 
the  gain on properties for is due primarily to the final resolution of contingencies in the sale agreements relating to properties sold in funds from operations the company uses a supplemental performance measure along with net earnings to report its operating results 
this measure is referred to as funds from operations ffo 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit as net earnings computed in accordance with gaap  excluding cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles  extraordinary items  and gains or losses on sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap 
ffo is not indicative that cash flows are adequate to fund all cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company s ffo may not be comparable to the ffo of other reit s because they may not use the current nareit definition or they may interpret the definition differently 
ffo was  in   in and  in the increases in ffo in and were due primarily to the property acquisitions and the development and redevelopment projects referred to above and higher rents from re leased space 
the reasons for significant changes in revenues and expenses comprising ffo by segment are described above 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of  at december  net cash provided by operating activities was   and  in   and  respectively 
the changes in cash provided by operating activities were due primarily to the factors discussed above in the comparisons of operating results 
the level of net cash provided by operating activities is also affected by the timing of receipt of revenues and the payment of operating and interest expenses 
net cash used by investing activities decreased by  to  in from  in the decrease was due primarily to lower levels of acquisitions  and development activity net cash used by investing activities increased by  to  in from  in the increase was due primarily to higher levels of acquisitions and development activity 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by  to  in from  in the decrease was due primarily to lower net credit line borrowings  decreased net financing refinancing activity  and decreased net construction borrowings  partly offset by decreased share repurchases net cash provided by financing activities increased by  to  in compared to net cash used by financing activities of  in financing activities provided cash in primarily because of financing refinancing activity for four shopping centers 
the company currently has a  unsecured line of credit available for various purposes  including acquisition  development or redevelopment of properties and liquidity  subject to various terms and conditions 
the note payable under the bank line of credit had an outstanding balance of  at december  the company has registered to sell up to an aggregate of approximately  based on the public offering price of additional common shares of beneficial interest and or debt securities 
the shares and debt may be issued from time to time at prices  in amounts and on terms to be determined at the time of offering 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  mart is required to pay dividends to its shareholders of at least of its reit taxable income 
mart intends to pay these dividends from operating cash flows 
while mart intends to distribute to its shareholders a substantial portion of its cash flows from operating activities  mart also intends to retain or reserve such amounts as it considers necessary from time to time for the acquisition or development of new properties as suitable opportunities arise and for the expansion and renovation of its shopping centers 
also  mart currently has and expects to continue to maintain a line of credit from its primary bank 
the company anticipates material commitments for capital expenditures to include  in the next two years  the ongoing redevelopment of eleven projects  currently in various stages of planning  at an estimated cost of  the company expects to fund the development projects and other capital expenditures with available net cash flows from operating activities and if necessary with construction loan financing  long term mortgage financing on unencumbered operating properties or the use of its line of credit 
it is management s intention that mart continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business 
management cannot practically quantify mart s cash requirements  but expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through available net cash flow provided by operations and short term borrowings 
to meet its long term capital requirements  mart intends to obtain funds through additional equity offerings  joint ventures or long term debt financing in a manner consistent with its financial strategy 
the company anticipates that the cash flow available from operations  together with cash from borrowings and equity offerings  will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital needs in both the short and long term 
market risk information the market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial and commodity instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to variable rate borrowings used to maintain liquidity eg  credit line borrowings or finance project development costs eg  construction loans 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  the company relies primarily on long term  fixed rate nonrecourse loans from institutional lenders to finance its operating properties 
in addition  long term fixed rate financing is typically arranged concurrently with or shortly after a variable rate project construction loan is negotiated or the project is complete 
the company has not used derivative financial or commodity instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored closely by management 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other data required to evaluate the expected cash flows of the company under debt agreements and its sensitivity to interest rate changes 
at december   the company s variable rate debt relates to borrowings under its credit line and construction loans 
the credit line borrowings are assumed to be repaid at their maturity dates through the construction loans are assumed to be repaid at their maturity in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the table below presents the annual maturities  weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt at the end of each year and fair values required to evaluate the expected cash flows of the company under debt and related agreements and its sensitivity to interest rate changes at december  as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider exposures of positions that could arise after that date 
in thousands fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt         weighted average interest rate variable rate debt      weighted average interest rate inflation the majority of leases for the shopping center properties contain provisions for annual increases in rents and or provisions  which entitle mart to receive percentage rents  based on the tenants gross sales 
such provisions ameliorate the risk to mart of the adverse effects of inflation 
if a recession were to begin and continue for a prolonged time  ffo could decline as some tenants may have trouble meeting their lease obligations 
most of the leases for the properties require the tenants to pay a substantial share of operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs  and thereby reduce mart s exposure to increased costs 
in addition  many of the leases for the properties are for terms of less than years  which may enable mart to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases if rents are below the then existing market rates 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combination initiated after june sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from an amortization approach to an impairment only approach 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january  will not have an effect on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assts and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the statement does not change the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
 however  it resolves various implementation issues of sfas no 
and establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
it retains the requirement of apb opinion no 
to report separately discontinued operations but extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
we do not believe that adoption of this statement in will have a material effect on our financial statements
