item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of heritage propane partners  lp and its subsidiaries  formerly peoples gas and the surviving legal entity in the series of transactions with us propane  and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of peoples gas and predecessor heritage and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  excluding historical information  as well as some statements by heritage in periodic press releases and some oral statements of heritage officials during presentations about the partnership  include certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of statements using words such as anticipate  believe  intend  project  plan  continue  estimate  forecast  may  will  or similar expressions help identify forward looking statements 
although heritage believes such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions and current expectations and projections about future events  no assurance can be given that every objective will be reached 
actual results may differ materially from any results projected  forecasted  estimated or expressed in forward looking statements since many of the factors that determine these results are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
such factors include o changes in general economic conditions in the united states of america as well as changes in general economic conditions and currencies in foreign countries  o weather conditions that vary significantly from historically normal conditions which may adversely affect the demand for propane and heritage s financial condition  o heritage s success in hedging its product supply positions  o the effectiveness of risk management policies and procedures and the ability of heritage s liquids marketing counter parties to satisfy their financial commitments  o the general level of petroleum product demand and the availability and price of propane supplies  o sudden and sharp propane price increases and market volatility may adversely affect heritage s operating results  o the political and economic stability of petroleum producing nations  o heritage s ability to conduct business in foreign countries  o heritage s ability to obtain adequate supplies of propane for retail sale in the event of an interruption in supply or transportation  o energy prices generally and specifically  the price of propane to the consumer compared to the price of alternative and competing fuels  o the maturity of the propane industry and competition from other propane distributors and other energy sources  o energy efficiencies and technological trends may affect demand for propane  o the availability and cost of capital  o heritage s ability to access certain capital sources may require it to obtain a debt rating  o changes in laws and regulations to which heritage is subject  including tax  environmental  transportation  and employment regulations  o operating risks incidental to transporting  storing  and distributing propane  including litigation risks which may not be covered by insurance  o heritage s ability to generate available cash for distributions to unitholders  o the costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings against heritage or which may be brought against it  o heritage s ability to sustain historical levels of internal growth  o heritage s ability to continue to locate and acquire other propane companies at purchase prices that are accretive to its financial results  o cash distributions to unitholders are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with heritage s performance and other external factors  including restrictions in heritage s debt agreements  and o heritage may sell additional limited partner interests  thus diluting the existing interest of unitholders 
general the retail propane business is a margin based business in which gross profits depend on the excess of sales price over propane supply costs 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which heritage will have no control 
product supply contracts are one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally permit suppliers to charge posted prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
since rapid increases in the wholesale cost of propane may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce gross profits 
heritage generally has and predecessor heritage generally had attempted to reduce price risk by purchasing propane on a short term basis 
heritage has and predecessor heritage had on occasion purchased significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at its customer service locations and in major storage facilities for future resale 
the retail propane business of heritage consists principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major fuel suppliers  to its customer service locations and then to tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating  and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  tobacco curing  poultry brooding  and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel for internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts and as a heating source in manufacturing and mining processes 
heritage s propane distribution business is largely seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in its service areas 
propane sales to residential and commercial customers are affected by winter heating season requirements 
historically  approximately two thirds of heritage s retail propane volume and in excess of of heritage s ebitda is attributable to sales during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september of each year 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the first and second fiscal quarters  however  cash flow from operations is generally greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the six month peak heating season 
sales to industrial and agricultural customers are much less weather sensitive a substantial portion of heritage s propane is used in the heating sensitive residential and commercial markets causing the temperatures realized in heritage s areas of operations  particularly during the six month peak heating season  to have a significant effect on its financial performance 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater propane use 
heritage uses information based on normal temperatures in understanding how temperatures that are colder or warmer than normal affect historical results of operations and in preparing forecasts of future operations 
gross profit margins are not only affected by weather patterns  but also vary according to customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers generate higher margins than sales to certain other customer groups  such as commercial or agricultural customers 
wholesale margins are substantially lower than retail margins 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographical region 
accordingly  a change in customer or geographic mix can affect gross profit without necessarily affecting total revenues 
the following is a discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of heritage propane partners  lp and its subsidiaries  formerly peoples gas and the surviving legal entity in the series of transactions with us propane  and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial and operating data and notes thereto and the historical financial and operating data and notes thereto of heritage propane partners  lp and its subsidiaries predecessor heritage included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
analysis of historical results of operations heritage propane partners  lp formerly peoples gas the formation of us propane formerly peoples gas and the merger with predecessor heritage affect the comparability of i the fiscal year ended august  to the eight months ended august   because the volumes and results of operations of fiscal year include a full year of the volumes and results of operations of the propane operations of the combined operations  and ii the results of the eight months ended august  to the eight months ended august   because the volumes and results of operations for the period from august  through august  also include the volumes and results of operations of agl  united cities  piedmont  and predecessor heritage 
the increases in the line items discussed below are a result of these transactions 
amounts discussed below reflect of the results of mp energy partnership during the period from august  through august  and the fiscal years ended august  and august  mp energy partnership is a general partnership in which heritage owns a interest 
because mp energy partnership is primarily engaged in lower margin wholesale distribution  its contribution to heritage s net income is not significant and the minority interest of this partnership is excluded from the ebitda calculation 
fiscal year ended august  compared to the fiscal year ended august  volume 
total retail gallons sold in fiscal year were million  a decrease of million from the million gallons sold in fiscal year the decrease in gallons sold was due to the significantly warmer than normal weather in fiscal year temperatures in the partnership s area of operations were an average of warmer than last year and warmer than normal 
the decrease in gallons sold because of the significantly warmer weather was partially offset by the volume increases realized from acquisitions that were not included in the year ended august  heritage sold approximately million wholesale gallons during fiscal year of which million were domestic wholesale and million were foreign wholesale 
in fiscal year  heritage sold million domestic wholesale gallons and million foreign wholesale gallons 
revenues 
total revenues for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million  as compared to million in fiscal year retail revenues for fiscal year were million as compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of million due primarily to a decrease in selling prices 
selling prices in all the reportable segments decreased from last year in response to lower supply costs 
domestic wholesale revenues increased million to million  due to acquisition related volumes  offset by revenue decreases due to lower selling prices this fiscal year as compared to fiscal year foreign wholesale revenues were million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of million primarily due to a combination of decreased volumes and lower selling prices 
liquids marketing revenues decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to an overall reduction in the number of contracts entered into during fiscal year and lower commodity prices as compared to fiscal year other domestic revenues increased by million to for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year ended as a result of acquisitions and an increase in other service fees that are not weather sensitive 
cost of products sold 
total cost of sales decreased million to million as compared to for fiscal year retail fuel cost of sales decreased million to million for fiscal year  due to decreases in the cost of propane as compared to fiscal year although the market price for propane for the year ended august  is well below the price for the year ended august   the average cost per gallon sold for fiscal year was negatively impacted by the higher cost of pre bought inventory that was absorbed into cost of sales throughout the year ended august  wholesale cost of sales decreased million primarily due to decreased product costs this fiscal year and the decreased volumes described above 
the liquids marketing cost of sales decreased million to million during fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year  as the volume of contracts purchased during the year ended august  declined in relation to the reduced volume of contracts sold coupled with the decreased market price 
other cost of sales increased million to for fiscal year primarily due to acquisitions 
gross profit 
total gross profit decreased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year  due to the aforementioned decreases in volumes and revenues described above  offset in part by the decreases in product costs 
for fiscal year  retail fuel gross profit was million  domestic wholesale was million  and other gross profit was million 
foreign wholesale gross profit was million and liquids marketing gross profit was million for fiscal year as a comparison  for fiscal year  heritage recorded retail fuel gross profit of million  wholesale fuel gross profit of million  liquids marketing gross profit was million  foreign gross profit of million and other gross profit of million for a total gross profit of million 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase of million is primarily the result of the additional operating expenses incurred for employee wages and benefits related to the growth of heritage from acquisitions since the fiscal year ended august   offset by the decrease in the short term incentive plan expense due to decreased operating income and the reduced operating expenses related to the cost reduction efforts initiated during the unusually warm winter of fiscal year selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this decrease is primarily attributable to the additional expenses incurred in fiscal year related to the executive short term compensation plan that did not reoccur during fiscal year depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease is primarily attributable to the adoption of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on september   which resulted in goodwill no longer being amortized 
the adoption of sfas resulted in million less amortization expense for the year ended august  goodwill amortization totaled million for the year ended august  this decrease was offset by increased depreciation related to property  plant and equipment  and intangible assets from the businesses acquired since the year ended august  operating income 
heritage reported operating income of million in fiscal year as compared to the operating income of million for fiscal year the decrease of million is due to the related decrease in gross profit and increase in operating expenses described above offset by the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses and the decrease in deprecation and amortization previously discussed 
net income 
heritage reported net income of million  or per limited partner unit  for fiscal year  a decrease of million from the net income of million for fiscal year this reduction is primarily due to the decreased operating income described above  and a million increase in interest expense  offset by a decrease in minority interest expense due to decreased net income  a decrease in other expenses  and an increase in earnings from affiliates 
ebitda 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization decreased million to million for fiscal year  as compared to ebitda of million for fiscal year this decrease is related to the decrease in gross margin realized during the year ended august  as compared to the year ended august   resulting in reduced operating income 
heritage s ebitda includes the ebitda of investees  but does not include the ebitda of the minority interest of mp energy partnership 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations  but provides additional information for evaluating heritage s ability to make the minimum quarterly distribution 
fiscal year ended august  compared to the eight months ended august  volume 
total retail gallons sold in the year ended august  were million  an increase of million over the million gallons sold in the eight months ended august  predecessor heritage sold million retail gallons in the approximate eleven month period ended august  a return to more normal weather during the peak heating season plus acquisitions was responsible for the increase 
heritage sold approximately million wholesale gallons during fiscal year of which million were domestic wholesale and million were foreign wholesale 
in the eight months ended august   heritage sold million domestic wholesale gallons and million foreign wholesale gallons 
the increase in wholesale gallons is attributable to having a full year of the operations of predecessor heritage reported in fiscal year  as peoples gas did not have any wholesale gallons that were reported in the eight months ended august  as a comparison  predecessor heritage sold approximately million wholesale gallons in the eleven month period ended august  of which million were domestic wholesale and million were foreign wholesale

net income loss 
for the eight month period ended august   heritage had a net loss of million  a decrease of million as compared to net income for the eight months ended august  of million 
this decrease is the result of decreased operating income described above 
liquidity and capital resources the ability of heritage to satisfy its obligations will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business  and weather conditions  and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
future capital requirements of heritage are expected to be provided by cash flows from operating activities 
to the extent future capital requirements exceed cash flows from operating activities a working capital will be financed by the working capital line of credit and repaid from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable  b growth capital  mainly for customer tanks  expended will be financed by the revolving acquisition line of credit  and c acquisition capital expenditures will be financed by the revolving acquisition line of credit  other lines of credit  long term debt  the issuance of additional common units or a combination thereof

financing activities 
cash used in financing activities of million during the fiscal year ended august   was primarily a net increase in short term debt of million and a net decrease in long term debt of million  offset by million of cash distributions paid to unitholders and the general partner 
financing and sources of liquidity heritage has a bank credit facility  which includes a working capital facility  providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for working capital and other general partnership purposes  and an acquisition facility  providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for acquisitions and improvements 
the working capital facility expires june  and the acquisition facility expires december   at which time the facility will convert to a term loan payable in quarterly installments with a final maturity of june  see note working capital facility and long term debt to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report 
the partnership uses its cash provided by operating and financing activities to provide distributions to unitholders and to fund acquisition  maintenance  and growth capital expenditures 
acquisition capital expenditures  which include expenditures related to the acquisition of retail propane operations and intangibles associated with such acquired businesses  were million for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to million for fiscal year in addition to the million of cash expended for acquisitions during fiscal year  million for notes payable on non compete agreements were issued in connection with certain acquisitions 
in comparison  in addition to the million of cash expended for acquisitions during the fiscal year ended august   million of common units and million for notes payable on non compete agreements were issued in connection with certain acquisitions 
under the partnership agreement  the partnership will distribute to the general partner and its limited partners  days after the end of each fiscal quarter  an amount equal to all of its available cash for such quarter 
available cash generally means  with respect to any quarter of the partnership  all cash on hand at the end of such quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion that is necessary or appropriate to provide for future cash requirements 
the partnership s commitment to its unitholders is to distribute the increase in its cash flow while maintaining prudent reserves for the partnership s operations 
the partnership raised the quarterly distribution per unit for the first quarter of fiscal year from the per unit distribution paid on october  for the fourth quarter ended august   to the current level of per unit or annually 
the current distribution level includes incentive distributions payable to the general partner to the extent the quarterly distribution exceeds per unit annually 
the assets utilized in the propane business do not typically require lengthy manufacturing process time or complicated  high technology components 
accordingly  the partnership does not have any significant financial commitments for capital expenditures 
in addition  the partnership has not experienced any significant increases attributable to inflation in the cost of these assets or in its operations
