item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business rfm designs  develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of radio frequency components and modules 
the company s products are organized into two groups the low power products group and the communications products group 
the low power products group includes low power components  as well as virtual wire short range radio products 
the communications products group includes frequency control modules and filter products 
the company s products are based on saw technology  and the company s strategy is to leverage its radio frequency design skills and its packaging technology to provide saw based solutions to the current and emerging needs of the electronics industry 
the company s products include more than resonators  filters  oscillators  transceivers  transmitters and receivers 
the company s average selling prices within these product lines generally range from 
to for low power products and from to for communications products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company is required to make certain estimates  judgements and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies and estimates  which are believed to be the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results  are stated in this section 
the following policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto 
accounts receivable the company performs credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon their payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer information 
the company maintains credit insurance on major customer balances and has a relatively diversified customer base 
there is no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in future periods 
if a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of a large customer or group of customers  that could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory the company values inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory on a first in  first out basis or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company regularly reviews its actual costs and the estimated market value of inventory  and uses a standard cost system to estimate the actual costs of its inventory 
significant changes to purchasing or manufacturing costs either an increase or a decrease could cause material changes to the valuation of its inventory in the period in which the company adjusts its standard costs to reflect the change 
market value of inventory is estimated based upon existing and forecasted demand for the company s end products for the next twelve months and estimated amounts of inventory that would be consumed 
the company reduces the valuation of inventory items that have had limited usage over time and those items that it believes may no longer be usable due to product obsolescence or changes in its marketing or manufacturing plans to discontinue products 
examples of management decisions in recent years that resulted in significant inventory write downs were the decision to discontinue the first generation of virtual wire products and the decision to move assembly production 
table of contents offshore and discontinue some products 
the electronics industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the valuation adjustment for obsolete and slow moving inventory may be understated or overstated 
if the company changes its estimate of future demand  it is required to increase or decrease its inventory valuation  with a corresponding impact on cost of sales in the period in which the determination is made 
therefore  any significant changes in manufacturing cost  unanticipated changes in product demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and reported operating results 
fixed asset impairment the company regularly examines its fixed assets to identify equipment that is no longer needed and writes such assets down to estimated realizable value 
in recent years  the company moved assembly production offshore  so there were significant adjustments to reflect fixed asset impairments for equipment no longer required 
the company s estimate of realizable value may be significantly different from what is actually received when the assets are ultimately sold 
an adjustment to profit or loss is required in the period in which a material variation is identified 
the company operates in a very competitive environment in which there is pressure to seek constant cost reduction 
if the company identifies lower cost alternatives in future periods by moving production or altering production processes  it could be required to recognize asset impairments on equipment no longer required 
as evidenced by write downs in prior periods  such impairments could be significant 
deferred tax assets in fiscal year  the company provided a full valuation asset allowance on tax loss carryforwards and other potential tax benefits according to fas as a result  to the extent that the company realizes those benefits in future periods  these benefits will favorably impact income 
for instance  a change in tax law allowed the company to collect a significant tax refund in fiscal year  which positively affected income in that year 
accrued medical benefits the company largely self insures the payment of medical benefits to its employees 
as a result  it regularly estimates the value of unpaid benefits based upon historical trends and uses that information to record its liability for benefits that have been incurred but not yet paid 
the company has stop loss insurance coverage in effect to cover the costs of medical claims over certain deductible amounts for any given plan year for an individual claimant or in the aggregate 
however  the trend of medical claims may significantly and unexpectedly change over a short period of time  in which case the company s liability for unpaid claims may no longer be accurate 
this could cause the company to either increase or decrease its expense in a material way in the period in which the change occurred 
revenue recognition sales are recognized when products are shipped 
that is the point at which legal title passes to the customer 
the standard terms and conditions are fob the company s factory 
the company permits the return of defective products and accepts limited amounts of product returns in other instances 
accordingly  the company provides allowances for the estimated amounts of these returns at the time of revenue recognition 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion relates to the financial statements of the company for the fiscal year ended august  current year or fiscal  in comparison to the fiscal year ended august  prior year or fiscal  as well as the fiscal year ended august  fiscal 
in addition  there is discussion of the financial statements for the three months ended august  fourth quarter  in comparison to the three months ended august  comparable quarter of the prior year  as well as the three months ended may  previous quarter 
the following table sets forth  for the years ended august i the percentage relationship of certain items from the company s statements of operations to total sales and ii the percentage change in these items from year to year percentage of sales year to year change to to sales cost of sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring litigation total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss 
table of contents sales the following table sets forth the components of the company s sales and percentage relationship of the components to total sales for the periods indicated year ended august  amount of total amount of total amount of total dollars in thousands product sales low power product group low power components virtual wire radio products subtotal communications products group frequency control modules filters subtotal total product sales technology development sales total sales total sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of units sold  which occurred in most of the company s product lines 
the decrease in the number of units sold was primarily due to the general economic slowdown  which occurred in most of the company s markets 
an economic downturn occurred in the company s largest market  the automotive market  although to a lesser extent than some other markets  such as the telecommunications market 
the company believes that although progress was made in market acceptance of some of its newer products  overall sales for even some of those products was adversely impacted by economic conditions for existing or potential customers in their markets 
despite participating in very price competitive markets  the company did not experience a decrease in the average selling prices for its products within its various product lines in the current year  although it did back away from some business in several situations where pricing did not meet its profit guidelines 
in most cases  the company was able to obtain new business from new customers to replace business that was lost due to competitive pricing pressures 
the company has achieved significant market position in most of its markets 
however  the company believes that price competition from much larger and better financed competitors represents a significant risk in maintaining its sales levels and gross margins in the price sensitive markets in which it competes  particularly the automotive market 
total sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s base low power components business remained constant  but all the other product lines combined increased almost  primarily due to an increased number of units sold of those products 
in the past several years  the company had concentrated its product development and sales promotion efforts on the virtual wire  frequency control and filter product lines 
the increase in sales in fiscal is a result of increased 
table of contents market acceptance of the new products that have been developed for those product lines 
average selling prices were relatively stable during fiscal sales for low power components products decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal year  while they did not change in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in sales during the current year was due to a decrease in the number of units sold  particularly for its older style  to packaged products 
the reduction in the number of to products sold continues a trend that has been seen for the past several years of applications for those products either converting to surface mount versions or being lost to lower priced competitors 
the reduction in number of units of surface mount products sold to automotive customers for traditional rke applications was partially offset by an increase in number of units sold for newer tire pressure monitoring applications 
during the year  sales of low power components products fluctuated in accordance with changing production schedules for automotive customers 
this fluctuation up and down is expected to continue 
the company has recently observed increased price pressure for low power component products in its automotive markets 
therefore  average selling prices for these products are expected to decrease in the next year 
in addition  the trend of lower to product sales is expected to accelerate  as some applications are expected to convert to sales for virtual wire short range radio products 
as a result  low power components sales are expected to decrease somewhat in the next fiscal year  despite the fact that the number of units sold for tire pressure monitoring applications may continue to increase 
sales for virtual wire short range radio products decreased in fiscal year  while they increased in fiscal year in the current year  the reduction in sales was primarily due to an almost complete elimination of sales of the first generation of these products  which were discontinued during the prior year 
sales of second generation products were similar to the prior year  while average selling prices decreased slightly 
for several years  the company has devoted considerable resources to product and market development of virtual wire short range radio products 
the company believes these products offer the potential for significant growth in sales in numerous new applications  particularly for utility meter reading applications that require small size and low power consumption 
the increase in sales that was noted in the prior year was due to an increased number of units shipped  as these products achieved greater market acceptance 
the company intends to continue working with its customers to develop new applications using virtual wire short range radio products  and the timing of any sales resulting from such new applications is dependent upon the customers product development and product introduction cycles 
it is difficult to predict when  or if  new applications of products will have a significant impact on the company s sales 
filter sales decreased in fiscal  compared to an increase of in fiscal in both years  the company sold an increased number of units  particularly for newer products 
however  in the current year  the amount of sales declined due to a decrease in average selling prices as a result of changes in product mix 
in the current year  the number of units sold of relatively high priced filters for telecommunications applications declined due to a severe downturn in economic conditions in that market 
in the prior year  an increase in the number of units sold of those same products had resulted in the increase in total filter sales 
in the current year  the company partially offset the reduction in sales to telecommunications customers by introducing relatively low priced products for a new satellite radio application for the automotive market 
however  total filter sales still decreased 
in recent years  the company has devoted a considerable portion of its engineering resources to filters and has developed many new products 
the increase in number of units sold in fiscal reflects success in several of these programs 
however  uncertain economic conditions in the telecommunications market make it very difficult to predict when  if ever  these new products will result in significant increased sales for the company 
frequency control module sales decreased in fiscal compared to an increase of in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to the introduction of a new line of optical timing products based upon patented technology that targets the optical dense wave division multiplex dwdm 
table of contents marketplace 
the decrease in fiscal resulted from a decrease in the number of units sold of those same products  as that segment of the telecommunications market was particularly hard hit by economic conditions 
this severe economic downturn makes it very uncertain when  if ever  market conditions in that market will result in an opportunity to resume sales of these new optical timing products 
the company s top five customers accounted for approximately   and of the company s total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
distribution related customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
one customer accounted for of total sales in fiscal and  while no customers accounted for or more in fiscal year the company s sales strategy is to seek diversification in its customer base  however  due to the very competitive nature of the markets in which it competes  the company is not certain it will be able to continue to achieve this diversification 
international sales primarily in europe and asia were approximately  and of the company s total sales during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company considers all product sales with a delivery destination outside north america to be international sales 
these sales are denominated primarily in us currency  although some european customers require the company to sell in euros 
the company intends to continue its focus on international sales and anticipates that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its business 
international sales are subject to fluctuations as a result of local economic conditions and competition  and the company cannot predict whether it will continue to derive a significant portion of its business from international sales 
while the company has achieved sales increases in prior periods  there can be no assurance that this can be achieved in future periods 
the company s success is highly dependent on achieving technological advances in its product design and manufacturing capabilities at both the dallas and offshore locations  as well as its ability to sell its products in a competitive marketplace that can be influenced by outside factors such as economic and regulatory conditions 
competition from alternative technologies or from competitors duplicating the company s technologies may adversely affect selling prices and market share 
gross profit gross profit margin increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal the gross margin increase in both fiscal and resulted from the gradual impact of the company s program to reduce manufacturing costs 
there were several elements to the cost reduction program 
the first element was the move of volume assembly operations offshore to contract manufacturing companies 
the company transitioned assembly operations offshore over a two year period and by the end of the current year  this process was essentially complete 
during the fiscal fourth quarter  of the reported sales and of the units produced were assembled by offshore sources 
during the current year  the company started production at two additional contractors  morioka seiko instruments  inc and tai saw technologies  inc 
the second element of the cost reduction program was to reduce costs in the company s dallas operations 
the company reduced its workforce  including contract labor  during fiscal and most of the reductions were related to the transition to offshore manufacturing 
as a result of these reductions  the company s labor and overhead costs were considerably reduced from prior periods 
since the transition had been essentially completed at the end of the current year  the company does not anticipate further significant reductions in the number of employees 
the third element of the cost reduction program was to transition the company s virtual wire customers to more cost effective second generation products 
this was largely completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal and the current year results represent purely second generation results  which were much improved over the prior fiscal year 
the company incurred a great deal of cost in making this transition 
largely due to this conversion  both fiscal year and cost of sales included approximately million in special inventory charges related to elimination of product lines and transition to offshore manufacturing 

table of contents the final element of the cost reduction program is activity to reduce cost through purchasing savings  process improvements and yield enhancements 
the company devotes considerable resources to improving both the remaining operations in dallas and those of its offshore contractors to improve productivity and reduce cost and has achieved significant savings over the past two years 
this is the primary ongoing effort the company is making to reduce costs in response to the potential for reduced average selling prices 
there is no assurance that these efforts will be able to offset completely the impact of potential decreases in average selling prices 
if selling prices decrease more than average per unit manufacturing costs  a reduction in gross margins would result 
the company is working to improve its gross margins in two additional ways 
the first is by developing new products  particularly those that have greater potential for increased margins because of the technical advantages they offer to customers and by increasing its sales 
additional sales would contribute towards reduced costs  since fixed manufacturing costs would be spread over additional units 
while it is the strategic direction of the company to improve its gross margins  economic conditions  competitive pressures and other risks make the outcome uncertain 
the company has experienced sudden increases in demand in the past  which have put pressure on its own manufacturing facilities and those of its offshore contractors to increase capacity to meet this demand 
in addition  new products sometimes require different manufacturing processes than the company currently possesses 
the company has converted the majority of its assembly manufacturing requirements to offshore contractors 
the company may not be able to increase its manufacturing capacity  the manufacturing capacity of its assembly contractors  or improve its manufacturing processes in a timely manner so as to take advantage of increased market demand 
failure to do this would result in a loss of potential sales in the periods impacted 
research and development research and development expenses decreased approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal the current year s decrease was caused by at least two factors 
first  an increase of  in the engineering costs that were directly attributable to technology development sales 
these costs were recognized as cost of sales rather then research and development expense 
second  personnel costs have been reduced  as a result of the company s cost reduction program and reallocations from engineering design functions to manufacturing process engineering and manufacturing management functions to improve manufacturing efficiency and to support the offshore transition 
the reduction in expense in fiscal also resulted from a reduction in personnel costs  primarily due to reassignment of personnel to manufacturing responsibilities 
in addition  expenses in fiscal included approximately  in tooling depreciation expense that did not recur in fiscal the company believes that the continued development of its technology and new products is essential to its success and is committed to continuing its investment in research and development 
the company expects its investments in research and development to remain approximately the same or increase in absolute dollars over the next several quarters 
sales and marketing in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately million from the prior year  due primarily to decreased sales commissions resulting from decreased sales and a change in the company s program to reduce commission rates 
sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to decreased sales commissions resulting from a change in the company s program to reduce commission rates 
the company changed its representative sales commission structure in the middle of fiscal year  so the impact of the change was 
table of contents seen in both fiscal years 
sales and marketing expenses were of sales in fiscal and fiscal year the company expects to incur comparable sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars over the next several quarters  with the exception of sales commission expenses that will fluctuate in line with sales levels 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  in fiscal year and approximately the same amount in fiscal the decreases were part of the company s restructuring program and included reductions in personnel costs 
the company expects general and administrative expenses to remain approximately the same in absolute dollars over the next several quarters 
restructuring and impairment expense restructuring and impairment expenses were approximately  in the current year  compared to million in the prior year 
in the current year  these expenses consisted of a fixed asset charge to write down additional fixed assets that will no longer be required due to the decision to close a portion of the dallas operations 
in the prior year  they consisted of a fixed asset charge of million to write down or write off fixed assets and a charge of  to cover the severance costs of employees whose positions had been or would be eliminated by the manufacturing restructuring 
the company believes the restructuring of its assembly operations is now complete and does not anticipate significant additional restructuring and impairment expense regarding these measures 
litigation litigation expense amounted to zero in fiscal and the amounts in prior years consisted of expenses related to the resolution of various legal issues 
all of the matters have been resolved and the company does not anticipate similar expenses in future periods  except for immaterial expenses incurred in the ordinary course of its operations 
total operating expenses the company s restructuring program has had a significant impact on operating expenses 
total operating expenses for the current year decreased million from the prior year and million from fiscal after eliminating restructuring and impairment and litigation expenses  total operating expenses in the current year decreased compared to the prior year and compared to fiscal while some of the decrease was due to lower sales commissions resulting from lower sales  most of the decrease was a result of the company s cost reduction efforts 
operating expenses were lowered to the point that  together with increased gross margins  allowed the company to return to profitability in the final quarter of fiscal the company intends to maintain profitability by holding its operating expenses relatively stable over the next several quarters  with the exception of sales commissions  which fluctuate in line with sales 
other income expense other expense  primarily interest expense on the company s bank debt  decreased  in the current year  compared to the prior year 
this was primarily due to a lower amount borrowed  as well as due to lower interest rates 
in the prior year  other expense  primarily interest expense on the company s debt  increased approximately  due to an increase in the amount borrowed 
the company expects to continue to pay down its bank debt  so it expects these expenses to decrease in the next fiscal year 
loss before income taxes loss before income taxes decreased to a million loss for the current year  compared to a million loss in the prior year and an million loss in fiscal the improvement in each year was primarily a result of improved gross profit and reduced operating expenses and reflects the positive impact of the company s restructuring program 

table of contents income tax expense benefit in the current year  the company received a tax refund of approximately million due to new legislation that allowed companies to obtain tax refunds for taxes paid in additional periods and additional categories of taxes 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of that amount in fiscal in the prior year  the company fully reserved  in a noncash charge  all tax benefits that had been recorded prior to that point in accordance with fas this resulted in million in income tax expense for fiscal in fiscal year  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million  since its operating performance and economic conditions had not yet required it to record fas valuation allowances 
the company does not expect to receive any additional tax refunds from the new legislation and does not expect to record any future federal income tax benefits or expense until the recovery of deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
potential tax savings from the federal loss carryforwards are still available to the company  however 
the company expects that this will improve both reported earnings and cash flow in future periods  if the company returns to profitability on an annual basis 
the company expects to continue to record relatively small state income tax provisions in future periods 
loss per share the net loss for the current year was  compared to a million loss in the prior year and million in fiscal the company s basic and diluted loss per share for fiscal was 
per share  compared to per share for fiscal and per share for fiscal the improvement in loss per share compared to the prior years was a result of the company s restructuring efforts and the absence of special charges that occurred in prior years 
fourth quarter of fiscal unaudited quarterly financial data is presented in note of the accompanying financial statements 
sales for the fourth quarter of million decreased approximately  compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year 
sales increased approximately compared to the previous third quarter 
the sales decrease in the current quarter compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in the number of units sold in the company s product lines and reflects the general downturn in the economy 
the sales increase from the previous quarter was primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold  particular to automotive customers whose requirements for their production schedules increased in the quarter 
the company expects sales for the next quarter may remain relatively flat with the current quarter 
historically  the company has experienced sales declines in its first quarter  so flat sales would represent some improvement 
the company currently cannot make any estimate of sales beyond the next quarter  due to the uncertain economic environment and the lack of visibility from customers in terms of backlog 
the company also believes the diversity of its product offering and customer base moderates to a great extent the impact of economic changes on any particular industry or market 
gross profit margins were in the fourth quarter  compared to for the comparable quarter of the prior year and for the previous quarter 
the primary reason for the improvement in gross margin from both periods is the ongoing impact of the company s restructuring program to reduce its manufacturing costs  which was described above 
in addition  included in the prior year s quarter were approximately million in special inventory charges to write off or reserve inventory resulting from the company s decision to restructure its manufacturing facilities which did not recur 
the current quarter also benefited from a very favorable mix within its product lines in the fiscal fourth quarter  which the company estimates to be approximately of sales 
the company expects that gross margins in the first quarter of fiscal may decrease by approximately of sales  because it may not have the favorable product mix that occurred in the current quarter 

table of contents operating expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the comparable quarter of the prior year and million for the previous quarter 
current quarter operating expenses included  in restructuring and impairment charges  compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year and none in the previous quarter 
these charges were described above 
without restructuring and impairment expense  operating expenses for the fourth quarter were not significantly changed from either the comparable quarter of the prior year or the previous quarter  except for sales commission expenses  which fluctuate with sales 
the company expects that operating expenses may remain stable over the next several quarters  except for sales commission expenses  which will change in line with sales levels 
other expense was  in the fiscal fourth quarter  compared to  in the comparable quarter of the prior year and  in the previous quarter 
this was primarily due to a lower amount borrowed  as well as due to lower interest rates 
the company expects its projected positive cash flow may allow it to continue to pay down debt  so interest expense may continue to decrease in the next quarter 
in addition  the fiscal fourth quarter benefited from  in gains on sales of fixed assets  which may not recur in future periods 
pre tax income for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately  compared to a loss of million in the comparable quarter of the prior year and a loss of  in the previous quarter 
the fiscal fourth quarter included the impact of million in special charges 
the charges consisted of million for inventory reserves because of transition to new products  million fixed asset impairment and million restructuring severance costs 
the special charges in fiscal fourth quarter were  for fixed asset impairment 
the company attributes a majority of the additional improvement to the ongoing favorable impact of its restructuring program to reduce costs in all areas 
the company expects that pre tax income may remain relatively stable for the next quarter  depending on  among other things  sales levels and the product mix of the sales that are recognized within the quarter 
income tax expense was  for the fiscal fourth quarter  compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year and a tax benefit of approximately million in the previous quarter 
in the comparable quarter of the prior year  the company booked a fas reserve of million against its deferred tax assets  as explained above 
in the previous quarter  the company recorded a tax refund of million to reflect the amount due as a result of recent changes in tax legislation 
the company does not expect to receive any additional tax refunds from the new legislation and does not expect to record any future federal income tax benefits or expense until the recovery of deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
the company expects to continue to record relatively small state income tax provisions in future periods 
diluted net income per share was in the fourth quarter  compared to a loss of for the comparable quarter of the prior year and income of for the previous quarter 
without unusual expenses  the diluted loss per share would have been for the comparable quarter of the prior year 
financial condition financing arrangements in december  the company entered into an agreement with a commercial bank for a credit facility consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million term note 
included in the revolving credit facility is an million loan that is supported by the export import bank exim bank 
both facilities terminate on december  the interest rate for both facilities is over the lender s prime rate 
as part of the agreement  the bank was given a ten year warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 

table of contents the proceeds of these new loans and the sale of approximately million in short term investments were used to pay off approximately million under the prior revolving credit facility  as well as million in obligations related to an equipment based operating lease facility 
as a result  the company completely satisfied its obligations to its former bank and acquired approximately million in capital assets that had formerly been utilized under operating leases 
the structure of the banking agreement ties amounts borrowed under the agreement to a borrowing base consisting of certain receivables  inventory  and fixed assets 
essentially all the assets of the company  tangible and intangible  are pledged as collateral under both facilities 
the term loan requires equal monthly payments of principal totaling  plus interest beginning january the term note also requires the company to pay off a portion of the term note in relation to equipment either being sold or moved to support the offshore manufacturing initiative  since the equipment serves as collateral for the term note 
the portion that must be paid off is equal to the appraised value of the equipment being moved 
so far this fiscal year  approximately million of the term note has been paid in that manner 
there is no assurance that potential future transactions can be accomplished on favorable terms 
should that not occur  there could be a slowdown in the company s plans to sell off excess assets or expand offshore production 
this credit facility contains financial covenants relating to various matters  including but not limited to minimum net worth  quarterly and monthly earnings  and limitations on changes in corporate structure  and restrictions on dividends and capital spending 
on four occasions  the company has amended the banking agreements to relax those covenants or make other changes for one time fees in the aggregate amount of  as of august   the company was in compliance with the amended covenants 
although the company believes that it will continue to meet the covenants  there is no assurance that this will occur 
should the company be unable to meet its operating plan due to a significant shortfall in sales or margin  a covenant violation could occur 
should there be a covenant violation without a waiver or amendment  the maturity of the company s debt could be accelerated and other sources of cash would be needed 
in december the company entered into an agreement to raise approximately  in cash by the sale of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
the sale consisted of  units 
each unit was sold at a price of and consisted of one share of common stock and a three year warrant to purchase one share of common stock at 
the agreement called for certain restrictions on the sale or further acquisition of stock by the investors  as well as the right to require registration in the future 
the proceeds of the sale of this stock were used to support the operations of the company 
cash flows liquidity at august  consisted primarily of approximately  of cash and approximately million available under the banking agreement 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the current year as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the prior year 
the million improvement from year to year was primarily due to an increase in the net income adjusted for noncash items  which was a million source of cash in the current year  compared to million use of cash in the prior year 
this improvement is a result of the company s cost reduction program  which was targeted to improve gross margins and reduce operating expenses 
partially offsetting this was million that was used in working capital in the current year  while million was provided from working capital in the prior year 
the primary use of cash for working capital in the current year was to pay down accounts payable by approximately million 
as of the end of the current year  the company had only minor amounts past due to its vendors 
the primary source of funds that were provided from working capital in the prior year was collection of an income tax receivable of million 
trade receivables decreased million in the current year due to lower sales and improved collections 
inventory decreased approximately million in the current year  as offshore contractors took over a portion of the 
table of contents responsibility for raw materials 
the company is targeting additional reductions of inventory in future periods as offshore contractors take on more of this responsibility 
the company plans to maintain a positive cash flow from operations for fiscal as it did in the current year 
it believes depreciation will continue to greatly exceed capital spending  providing an ongoing source of positive cash flow 
the company increased the current portion of its bank debt to million in the fourth quarter  reflecting its plans to continue to pay down more bank debt in fiscal than required under the loan s repayment terms 
continued positive cash flow should allow the company to operate in a normal manner for the next fiscal year  despite a relatively low amount of cash reserves 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be achieved 
cash provided from investing activities was million for the current year  resulting from the proceeds of sales of fixed assets of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the prior year  primarily as a result of approximately million in capital expenditures  which consisted of million that had formerly been leased and  of new items 
this was partially financed by the net sale of million in short term investments 
the company expects to acquire up to million of capital equipment by the end of fiscal due to its offshore manufacturing initiative  the company does not expect to require significant additions to its assembly facilities or equipment 
the company is currently in negotiations and is seeking to reduce its costs and bring space commitments in dallas in line with its restructured operations 
additional capital spending may result from the impact of decisions the company makes concerning its dallas facilities  for which the leases expire in fiscal the company believes the outcome of these negotiations will be favorable 
in the unlikely event that negotiations are unsuccessful  the company could incur substantial transition costs 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to net cash generated from financing activities of million in fiscal in fiscal  approximately million was used to reduce bank borrowings  while million was raised by increasing bank borrowings in the prior year 
in addition  in the prior year million was raised from sales of stock from the equity agreement mentioned above  stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
under the company s banking agreement  all receipts on trade receivables are applied to loans that are outstanding and the company borrows funds to support its activities according to its borrowing base 
as a result  repayments on debt and borrowings are large relative to sales 
as of august   the company had approximately million available under its banking agreement based upon the borrowing base at that time 
in addition  approximately million more may become available under the banking agreement if the company s borrowing base were to increase sufficiently to support increased borrowing 
the company is currently working with its bank to further increase availability 
however  there can be no assurance that this will happen 
while the company reached profitability in its fiscal fourth quarter  a reduction in sales or gross margins could occur due to economic or other factors 
the company believes that cash generated from operations  if any  its cash balances and the amounts available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s operating cash requirements through fiscal to the extent that these sources of funds are insufficient to meet the company s capital or operating requirements  the company may be required to raise additional funds
