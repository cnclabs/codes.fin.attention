item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on advanced drug delivery technologies and pharmaceutical products 
a substantial part of our operations is in spain  where we manufacture and market generic and branded pharmaceutical products and from which market we derive the majority of our sales 
our primary objective is to be a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on advanced drug delivery and formulation technologies that improve the effectiveness of existing and new pharmaceuticals 
we have patents and proprietary technologies that enhance or facilitate the absorption of drugs across membranes of the skin  mouth  nose  vagina and eye 
we are developing products incorporating these technologies and seek to form strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to facilitate the development and commercialization of our products 
we currently have strategic alliances with pfizer and auxilium and are in preliminary discussions with a number of other pharmaceutical companies to form additional alliances 
we have entered into a research services agreement with auxilium  an emerging therapeutic pharmaceutical company focused on diseases related to aging to develop and test various pharmaceutical compositions of a topical testosterone using our cpe permeation enhancement technology 
we have licensed our drug delivery technology to auxilium for use in the development and commercialization of a topical testosterone product 
phase iii clinical trials performed by auxilium for the approval of this product in the us have been completed 
we have entered into a research collaboration with pfizer in which we were granted a non exclusive worldwide royalty free license to use pfizer s compounds and technology to assess the performance of our cpe technology with pfizer s compounds 
as part of the agreement  we granted to pfizer the non exclusive right to test the ability of our cpe technology to enhance delivery of certain compounds proprietary to pfizer 
we entered into a strategic alliance with teva in july whereby we  through our spanish subsidiaries  received the right to register and market in spain more than of teva s products 
the products are comprised of both branded and generic forms 
sales from the products are expected to begin gradually  but will progress over the next two to three years 
an investment in additional sales representatives has been and will continue to be required  along with an increase in regulatory activities  both of which may create a short term decrease in our earnings 
through our subsidiary  laboratorios davur sl  we also submitted registrations to the spanish ministry of health for generic versions of various products in response to growing interest in generic drug products in spain 
we believe that gross margins may be lower on sales of these products 
we manufacture generic and branded pharmaceutical products in our zaragoza  spain facility and sell and market these products to physicians and pharmacists throughout spain 
in addition to manufacturing our own products  we utilize our excess capacity by acting as a contract manufacturer for other pharmaceutical companies 
we have not realized domestic taxable income to date 
at december   net operating losses available to offset future domestic taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately  million 
our us federal net operating loss carryforwards  if not utilized  expire at various dates from to we have recorded a valuation allowance against our entire future tax benefit arising from our domestic net operating losses 
the future utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited pursuant to us tax regulations 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased by from  in to  in the  increase was primarily the result of our continuing efforts in the generic drug market in spain 
we anticipated the opportunities in the emerging generic drug market in spain and began taking measures over three years ago to enter the spanish generic drug market 
we began to register  market and distribute generic pharmaceutical products in spain and began aligning our business model to be competitive in this arena  including hiring and training a new generic products sales force  submission of generic products to the spanish ministry of health for approval and a marketing campaign designed to position ourselves as a leader in the spanish generic drug market 
although in spain we reported an increase in net sales of in local currency in compared to the prior year  a three percent decline in the value of the spanish peseta and related euro negatively impacted revenues by approximately  sales of the product controlvas r  which accounted for approximately  of net sales in  declined to approximately  in as a result of our divestiture of the related drug license during the first quarter of  which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately  net sales in included sales of the product arzimol tm totaling approximately  which will not continue in due to termination of our joint marketing agreement with bristol myers squibb for this product 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by from  in to  in the  increase was the direct result of the growth in our net sales from to however  our gross margins for decreased to compared to gross margins of in the prior year  primarily as a result of the mix of products sold  including our new generic product line  as well as higher depreciation charges resulting from the recent renovations and improvements at our manufacturing facility 
approximately of our net sales during the year ended december  were generic product sales  which typically have lower sales prices and gross margins than branded products 
in comparison  we sold no generic drug products during the first three quarters of the prior year 
as generic product sales become more significant in the future  gross margins may continue to decrease 
additionally  the ministry of health in spain levies on pharmaceutical companies a tax for the purposes of funding rising healthcare costs in spain 
in  this tax had the effect of reducing gross profit by  or one percentage point 
selling and marketing expenses

we are using our us laboratory to develop potential product applications using our drug delivery techologies 
the expenditures in research and development  which totaled  in the fourth quarter  reflect our focus on projects that are necessary for expansion of our portfolio of marketed products and clinical trials involving our technologies 
we expect that our future expenditures for research and development activities will continue to increase as a result of programs that are necessary to advance new applications of our technologies 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by from  in to  in the  increase in was the result of increased amortization charges related to our recent acquisition of drug licenses and technologies  including codeisan r  approximately  and to a lesser extent  higher depreciation charges with respect to recent asset additions approximately  partially offset by the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates approximately 
depreciation and amortization charges are expected to be higher than in as a result of these acquisitions

receivables increased by approximately  in local currency  but fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates offset the increase by approximately  we have not experienced any material delinquencies on our receivables 
inventories increased from  at december  to  at december  primarily as a result of raw materials purchases in anticipation of demand for our generic products

the weighted average interest rate on our short term borrowings is 
long term debt  which totaled  at december   was reduced to zero during the year ended december  as a result of using proceeds from the sale of controlvas r to reduce the outstanding balance and was subsequently increased to  as of december  as a result of a government sponsored loan program in spain  whereby a non interest bearing loan has been provided for product development 
we have recorded a discount on the obligation of  using an imputed interest rate of 
the discount will be amortized to interest expense over the ten year term of the loan

in the past  we have experienced lower sales in the third calendar quarter and higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to seasonality 
as we market more pharmaceutical products whose sales are seasonal  seasonality of sales may become more significant 
neither inflation nor changing prices has materially impacted our net sales or income from operations for the periods presented 
we expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
we continue to explore alternative sources for financing our business activities  including the possibility of public and or private offerings of our securities 
in appropriate situations  that will be strategically determined  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contribution by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development  testing  manufacturing and marketing of products under development 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies include o inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
o revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain oral or written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
we provide our customers with a limited right of return 
revenue is recognized at shipment and a reserve for sales returns is recorded 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with sfas no 
and of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience 
revenue from service sales is recognized when the service procedures have been completed or applicable milestones have been achieved 
revenue from research and development contracts is recognized over applicable contractual periods or as defined milestones are attained  as specified by each contract and as costs related to the contracts are incurred 
o foreign currency translation 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of the period 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses not impacting cash flows are credited to or charged against other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
o drug licenses and related costs 
drug licenses and related costs incurred in connection with acquiring licenses  patents and other proprietary rights related to our commercially developed products are capitalized 
capitalized drug licenses and related costs are being amortized on a straight line basis over fifteen years from the dates of acquisition 
carrying values of such assets are reviewed quarterly and are adjusted for any diminution in value 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new standard  which was adopted on january   requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the adoption of this standard on january  had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
supersedes apb no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises and requires that all business combinations be accounted for by a single method the purchase method 
sfas no 
also provides guidance on the recognition of intangible assets identified in a business combination and requires enhanced financial statement disclosures 
sfas no 
adopts a more aggregate view of goodwill and bases the accounting for goodwill on the units of the combined entity into which an acquired entity is integrated 
in addition  sfas no 
concludes that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is required for fiscal years beginning after december  the year for us  except for the nonamortization and amortization provisions which are required for goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes previous guidelines for financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
a substantial amount of our business is conducted in europe and is therefore influenced to the extent to which there are fluctuations in the us dollar s value against other currencies  specifically the euro and the spanish peseta 
on january   the euro became the official currency of european union eu member states with a fixed conversion rate against their national currencies 
the value of the euro against the us dollar and all other currencies  including the eu member states that are not participating in the euro zone  will fluctuate according to market conditions 
the permanent value of one euro in spain was fixed at spanish pesetas 
the exchange rate at december  and was spanish pesetas euros and spanish pesetas euros per us dollar  respectively 
the weighted average exchange rate for the years ended december  and was spanish pesetas euros and spanish pesetas euros per us dollar  respectively 
the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on long lived assets for the year ended december  was a decrease of  and the cumulative historical effect was a decrease of  as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
although exchange rates fluctuated significantly in recent years  including  the weakening of the euro in relation to the us dollar in  and the first six months of  we do not believe that the effect of foreign currency fluctuation is material to our results of operations as the expenses related to much of our foreign currency revenues are in the same currency as such revenues 
however  the carrying value of assets and reported values can be materially impacted by foreign currency translation  as can the translated amounts of net sales and expenses 
we have relied primarily upon financing activities to fund our operations in the us in the event that we are required to fund us operations or cash needs with funds generated in spain  currency rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant impact on us 
however  at the present time  we do not anticipate altering our business plans and practices to compensate for future currency fluctuations 
interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate on our short term borrowings is and the balance outstanding is  as of december  our long term borrowings are non interest bearing and the balance outstanding at december  is  including imputed interest at of  the effect of an increase in the interest rate of one hundred basis points to on short term borrowings and to on long term borrowings would have the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately  annually
