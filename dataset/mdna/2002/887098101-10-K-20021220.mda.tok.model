item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other portions of this annual report contain certain forward looking statements concerning the future operations of timberland bancorp  inc management desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and is including this statement for the express purpose of availing the company of the protections of such safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements contained in our annual report 
we have used forward looking statements to describe future plans and strategies  including our expectations of the company s future financial results 
management s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors which could affect actual results include interest rate trends  the general economic climate in the company s market area and the country as a whole  the ability of the company to control costs and expenses  competitive products and pricing  loan delinquency rates  and changes in federal and state regulation 
these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
operating strategy the bank is a community oriented bank which has traditionally offered a wide variety of savings products to its retail customers while concentrating its lending activities on real estate loans 
the primary elements of the bank s operating strategy include emphasize residential mortgage lending and residential construction lending 
the bank has historically attempted to establish itself as a niche lender in its primary market areas by focusing its lending activities primarily on the origination of loans secured by one to four family residential dwellings  including an emphasis on loans for the construction of residential dwellings 
in an effort to meet the credit needs of borrowers in its primary area  the bank actively originates one to four family mortgage loans that do not qualify for sale in the secondary market under fhlmc guidelines 
the bank has also been an active participant in the secondary market  originating residential loans for sale to the fhlmc on a servicing retained basis 
diversify primary market area by expanding branch office network 
in an effort to lessen its dependence on the grays harbor county market whose economy has historically been tied to the timber and fishing industries  the bank has opened branch offices in pierce  king  thurston and kitsap counties 
thurston  pierce  king and kitsap counties contain the olympia  bremerton  and seattle tacoma metropolitan areas and their economies are more diversified with the presence of government  aerospace and computer industries 
limit exposure to interest rate risk 
in recent years  the loans that the bank has retained in its portfolio generally have periodic interest rate adjustment features or have been relatively short term in nature 
loans originated for portfolio retention primarily have included arm loans and short term construction loans 
longer term fixed rate mortgage loans have generally been originated for sale in the secondary market 
management believes that the interest rate sensitivity of these adjustable rate and short term loans more closely match the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s funding sources than do other longer duration assets with fixed interest rates 
emphasize the origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
the bank established a business banking division in for the purpose of increasing the bank s origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
originally  three lenders were hired to staff the division 
currently  seven lenders are active in the origination of commercial loans 
increase the consumer loan portfolio 
in the bank hired a consumer loan specialist to increase the origination of consumer loans 
the consumer loans generated since that time have been secured primarily by real estate 
the bank expects to continue expanding its portfolio of consumer loans 
market risk and asset and liability management general 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investment  deposit and borrowing activities 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the bank manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk that could potentially have the largest material effect on the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instruments nor does it engage in hedging activities or derivative instruments 
furthermore  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets by retaining in its portfolio  short term loans and loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustments 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits  compared to brokered deposits  reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms of up to six years 
the bank has adopted a strategy that is designed to substantially match the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities 
the primary elements of this strategy involve originating arm loans for its portfolio  maintaining residential construction loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one to four family residential mortgage loans  matching asset and liability maturities  investing in short term securities  originating fixed rate loans for retention or sale in the secondary market and retaining the related loan servicing rights 
sharp increases or decreases in interest rates may adversely affect the bank s earnings 
however  based on a rate shock analysis prepared by the fhlb of seattle  an increase in interest rates of up to basis points would increase the bank s projected net interest income  primarily because a larger portion of the bank s interest rate sensitive assets than interest rate sensitive liabilities would reprice within a one year period 
similarly  further decreases in interest rates would negatively affect net interest income  as repricing would have the opposite effect 
management has sought to sustain the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
pursuant to this strategy  the bank actively originates adjustable rate loans for retention in its loan portfolio 
fixed rate mortgage loans generally are originated for the immediate or future resale in the secondary mortgage market 
at september   adjustable rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities constituted million or  of the bank s total combined mortgage loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio 
although the bank has sought to originate arm loans  the ability to originate such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
particularly in lower interest rate environments  borrowers often prefer to obtain fixed rate loans 
consumer loans and construction and land development loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans  and accordingly reduce the bank s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at september   the construction and land development  and consumer loan portfolios amounted to million and million  or and of total loans receivable including loans held for sale  respectively 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
management of the bank monitors the bank s interest rate sensitivity through the use of a model provided for the bank by the fhlb of seattle 
the model estimates the changes in npv net portfolio value and net interest income in response to a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the model first estimates the level of the bank s npv market value of assets  less market value of liabilities  plus or minus the market value of any off balance sheet items under the current rate environment 
in general  market values are estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows of each instrument by appropriate discount rates 
the model then recalculates the bank s npv under different interest rate scenarios 
the change in npv under the different interest rate scenarios provides a measure of the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
the following table is provided by the fhlb of seattle based on data at september  projected net interest income current market value interest rate estimated change change estimated change change scenario value from base from base value from base from base dollars in thousands base   computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan repayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
furthermore  the computations do not reflect any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  the bank would be expected to experience a decrease in npv and a decrease in net interest income 
in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  a decrease in npv and an increase in net interest income would be expected 
based upon the modeling described above  the bank s asset and liability structure generally results in decreases in npv and decreases in net interest income in a declining interest rate scenario 
this structure also generally results in decreases in npv and increases in net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could possibly deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
comparison of financial condition at september  and total assets total assets increased by million to million at september  from million at september  primarily due to increased deposit levels 
cash and due from financial institutions cash and due from financial institutions and interest bearing deposit balances in banks increased to million at september  from million at september  this increase is primarily due to investing proceeds from increased customer deposits 
investments  mortgage backed securities and fhlb stock investments  mortgage backed securities and fhlb stock increased to million at september  from million at september  primarily due to the conversion of million in fixed rate loans held for sale to mortgage backed securities 
for additional details on investments and mortgage backed securities  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
loans receivable and loans held for sale  net of allowance for loan losses net loans receivable  including loans held for sale  decreased million to million at september  from at september   primarily due to an million decrease in the bank s net construction loan portfolio and a million decrease in the bank s one to four family mortgage loan portfolio 
the construction loan decrease resulted primarily from the pay down of loans secured by condominium projects pursuant to unit sales and the conversion of construction loans to permanent status 
the decrease of one to four family mortgages held in the portfolio was primarily due to the conversion of million of loans held for sale to mortgage backed securities and the sale of million in fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans during the twelve month period 
the decreases in construction and one to four family mortgages were partially offset by a million increase in commercial real estate and business loans  which were originated primarily by the bank s business banking division 
bank owned life insurance boli the bank purchased million of boli during the september  quarter 
the annual increases in the cash surrender value of the insurance policies are reported as tax exempt non interest income under the current provisions of the irs code 
the bank anticipates that the tax equivalent yield on this asset will be greater than alternative investments and will help the bank offset the cost of employee benefit plans 
real estate owned  net real estate owned  net  decreased to  from million at september  this balance decreased due to  in one to four family reo s and  in land reo s being sold and was offset by the addition of  in one to four family reo s

deposits deposits increased by to million at september  from million at september   primarily due to a million increase in the bank s money market accounts  an million increase in now checking accounts  a million increase in passbook savings accounts and a million increase in non interest bearing accounts 
management attributes the deposit growth to its targeted marketing program and to consumer uncertainty regarding alternative investment options 
borrowings borrowings decreased million to million at september  from million at september   as funds from increased deposits were used to pay down the level of fhlb advances 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased by million to million at september  from million at september  the components of shareholder s equity were affected by net income of million  the repurchase of  shares of the company s stock for million  the payment of million in dividends to shareholders  and a  increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
also affecting shareholders equity were decreases of  in the equity component related to unearned shares issued to the management recognition and development plan and  in the equity component related to the unearned shares issued to the employee stock ownership plan  and a  increase to additional paid in capital from the exercise of stock options 
on may  the company announced a plan to repurchase  shares of the company s stock 
this marked the company s tenth stock repurchase plan 
as of september   the company had purchased  of these shares and cumulatively had repurchased  of the  shares that were issued when the company went public in january comparison of financial condition at september  and total assets total assets increased to million at september  from million at september   with the increase primarily reflected in a million increase in loans receivable  a million increase in investments and mortgage backed securities  and a million increase in premises and equipment 
cash and due from financial institutions cash and due from financial institutions and interest bearing deposit balances in banks increased to million at september  from million at september  investments  mortgage backed securities and fhlb stock investments  mortgage backed securities and fhlb stock increased to million at september  from million at september  the increase is primarily a result of the purchase of million in mortgage backed securities in connection with the bank s asset liability management strategies  and was partially offset by redemptions to fund share repurchases  and scheduled amortization and prepayments 
during the year  the bank converted million in fixed rate loans held for sale to mortgage backed securities 
these newly created securities were then sold and the proceeds were used to purchase other mortgage backed securities with shorter maturities 
for additional details on investments and mortgage backed securities  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
loans receivable and loans held for sale  net of allowance for loan losses net loans receivable  including loans held for sale  increased to million at september  from at september  this increase is primarily a result of million increase in net construction loans  a million increase in commercial real estate loans  and a million increase in commercial business loans 
these increases are partially offset by a million decrease in one to four family mortgage loans as the company sold million in fixed rate mortgage loans during the year and converted million in fixed rate mortgages to mortgage backed securities during the year 
real estate owned  net real estate owned  net  decreased to million at september  from million at september  this balance decreased primarily due to the sale of the bank s largest reo  a convenience store with retail space in kitsap county  washington

deposits deposits increased by to million at september  from million at september   with the bank s certificate of deposit accounts  checking accounts  passbook savings accounts  and money market accounts all indicating increases from september  totals 
borrowings borrowings decreased by to million at september  from million at september   as funds from increased deposits were used to pay down the level of fhlb advances 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity decreased by  to million at september  from million at september  the components of shareholders equity were affected by the repurchase of  shares of the company s stock for million  net income of million  the payment of million in dividends to shareholders  and a  increase net of tax in the fair value of investments available for sale 
also affecting shareholders equity was a  increase in the equity component related to the unearned shares issued to the employee stock ownership trust and a net reduction of  in the equity components related to unearned shares issued to the management recognition and development plan 
on september  the company announced a plan to repurchase  shares of the company s stock 
this marked the company s ninth stock repurchase plan 
as of september   the company had repurchased  of these shares and cumulatively had repurchased a total of  of the  shares that were issued when the company went public in january comparison of operating results for years ended september  and net income net income for the year ended september  was million or per diluted share per basic share compared to net income of million or per diluted share per basic share for the year ended september  the primary factors affecting the improved performance for the current year were increased net interest income  increased deposit fee income  increased income from loan sales  and a decreased provision for loan losses 
these items were partially offset by higher non interest expenses 
net interest income net interest income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to decreased funding costs 
interest expense decreased by million as the company s overall cost of funds decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  total interest income decreased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily due to lower average yields on interest earning assets  from in to in the company s net interest margin was for the year ended september  compared to a net interest margin of for the year ended september   primarily due to interest bearing liabilities repricing more quickly than interest earning assets in the declining rate environment 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased to  for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the provision for loan losses was lower in primarily because the bank experienced a lower level of net charge offs in for the years ended september  and  net charge offs were  and  respectively 
during the year ended september  the bank made a special  provision for loan losses when it determined that the credit quality of a large commercial business loan had deteriorated 
the loan was subsequently charged off in the year ended september  the bank has established a systematic methodology for the determination of provisions for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis the bank performs an analysis taking into consideration historic loss experience for various loan segments  changes in economic conditions  delinquency rates  and other factors to determine the level of allowance for loan losses needed 
the allowance for loan losses increased  to million at september  from million at september  the increased level of allowance for loan losses was primarily due to changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and increased loss factors utilized in the allowance for loan loss analysis 
changes in the composition of the loan portfolio were responsible for a portion of the increased allowance for loan losses 
the percentage of commercial real estate loans in the bank s loan portfolio increased to of total loans receivable at september  from at september   while the percentage of one to four family residential mortgage loans decreased to of total loans receivable at september  from at september  commercial real estate lending typically involves a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage lending and therefore commercial real estate loans have been assigned a loss factor that is greater than the loss factor assigned to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
estimated loss factors used in the allowance for loan loss analysis are established based in part on historic charge off data by loan category and economic conditions 
based on the trends in historical charge offs analysis  the loss factors used in the allowance for loan loss analysis for commercial business loans and credit cards were increased during the year ended september  the loss estimate factors for one to four family mortgage loans  multi family loans  commercial real estate loans  construction loans and land loans were also increased to a lesser extent due to weaknesses and uncertainties in the regional economy 
based on the systematic methodology management deemed the allowance for loan losses of million at september  of loans receivable and of non performing loans adequate to provide for estimated losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date 
for additional information  see item  business lending activities allowance for loan losses included herein 
non interest income for the year ended september  non interest income increased million to million from million for the year ended september  this increase is primarily due to an  increase in service charges on deposits  and a  increase in gain on sale of loans 
the increased deposit related service charge income is primarily a result of the bank s checking account acquisition program 
the increased loan sale gains are a result of the company selling million in fixed rate one to four family loans during the year compared to million in non interest expense total non interest expense increased million for the year ended september  compared to this increase is primarily reflected in a  increase in salary and benefit expense due primarily to increased numbers of employees  a  increase in atm operating expenses  a  increase in expenses related to premises and equipment resulting from new branches  and a  increase in profitability improvement consulting fees 
also affecting the year to year comparison was the recovery in of a prior nsf kiting related expense 
this recovery reduced the non interest expense for the year by  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily as a result of higher income before income taxes 
the effective rate was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  comparison of operating results for years ended september  and net income net income for the year ended september  was million  or per diluted share per basic share compared to million  or per diluted share per basic share for the year ended september  income for the year ended september  was increased by a   after income tax gain on sale of securities  a   after income tax market value recovery on loans held for sale  and a   after income tax recovery of a kiting related nsf expense

net income per share for the year ended september  was increased by basic and diluted as a result of the company s repurchase of its common shares during the year 
net interest income net interest income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to the bank s larger loan portfolio 
total interest income increased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase in net interest income was primarily a result of increased interest income from the bank s larger loan portfolio as average loan balances increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increased interest income was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense  primarily due to increased deposits and increased average fhlb advances 
the net interest margin increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the provision for loan losses was higher in primarily because the bank experienced a higher level of net charge offs in for the years ended september  and  net charge offs were  and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are customer deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on and the sale of loans  maturing securities and fhlb advances 
the company also raised million in net proceeds from the january stock offering 
while the maturity and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy other financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the bank generally maintains sufficient cash and short term investments to meet short term liquidity needs 
at september   the bank s regulatory liquidity ratio net cash  and short term and marketable assets  as a percentage of net deposits and short term liabilities was 
at september   the bank also maintained an uncommitted credit facility with the fhlb of seattle that provided for immediately available advances up to an aggregate equal to of total assets  under which million was outstanding 
liquidity management is both a short and long term responsibility of the bank s management 
the bank adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of i expected loan demand  ii projected loan sales  iii expected deposit flows  and iv yields available on interest bearing deposits 
excess liquidity is invested generally in interest bearing overnight deposits and other short term government and agency obligations 
if the bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  it has additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb and collateral for repurchase agreements 
the bank s primary investing activity is the origination of one to four family mortgage loans and construction and land development loans 
during the years ended september    and  the bank originated million  million and million of one to four family mortgage loans and million  million and million of construction and land development loans  respectively 
at september   the bank had mortgage loan commitments totaling million  standby letters of credit totaling  and undisbursed loans in process totaling million 
the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from september  totaled million 
historically  the bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature 
the bank s liquidity is also impacted by the volume of loans sold and loan principal payments 
during the years ended september    and  the bank sold million  million  and million in fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans 
the increased loans sales were due in large part to the refinancing cycle brought on by decreasing interest rates

effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operation of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
