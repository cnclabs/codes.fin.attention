item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the consolidated financial statements include regulated utility northwest natural gas company nw natural non regulated subsidiary businesses nng financial corporation financial corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary northwest energy corporation northwest energy or holding company  a wholly owned subsidiary formed in canor energy  ltd 
canor  a majority owned subsidiary  reclassified as a discontinued segment in and sold in together these businesses are referred to herein as the company see non utility operations below  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to the consolidated activities of the company for the three years ended dec 
 highlights among its accomplishments in  nw natural o grew the customer base by more than percent  adding  customers to its gas distribution system during the year  o commenced interstate gas storage services under a certificate granted by the federal energy regulatory commission  enabled by an expansion of the company s mist gas storage facilities  o extended natural gas service to the south beach district of newport  oregon  and made progress toward its goal of providing natural gas service to coos bay  oregon  in late or early o streamlined operations and improved service and productivity by combining call centers  replacing the general ledger accounting system and migrating away from a contract mainframe computer  o negotiated an agreement to purchase the stock of portland general electric company pge from enron corp  a transaction that  if completed  would create one of the largest energy companies in the northwest with billion in assets and more than million electric and gas customers  and o increased the quarterly dividend on common stock  making the th consecutive year in which the company s dividend payments have increased 
earnings and dividends the company s earnings applicable to common stock in both and were million  up from million in earnings for and set new records for the company while earnings for were its fourth highest on record 
diluted earnings per share from consolidated operations were a share in both and  compared to a share in nw natural earned a diluted share from gas utility operations in compared to in and in weather conditions in its service territory in were percent warmer than and percent colder than the year average 
weather in was percent colder than in and percent colder than the year average 
weather in was percent colder than the year average 
non utility operating results for were earnings of cents a share  including cents a share from gas storage services 
non utility operating results for  excluding canor  were earnings of cent a share compared to earnings of cents a share in the company recognized a gain equivalent to cents a share from the sale of canor in operating results from canor in were earnings of cent a share see non utility operations  below 
was the th consecutive year in which the company s dividends paid have increased 
dividends paid on common stock were a share in compared to a share in and a share in critical accounting policies in preparing the company s financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles  including making estimates and assumptions 
management considers critical accounting policies to be those that could result in materially different financial statement results if the company s assumptions regarding application of accounting principles were different 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below 
other significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
regulatory accounting nw natural generally uses the same accounting policies and practices used by unregulated companies for financial reporting under gaap 
however  sometimes these principles  such as statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  require special accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effect of regulation 
for example  in setting nw natural s retail rates  the opuc may not allow nw natural to currently charge its customers to recover certain expenses  but instead requires that these expenses be charged to customers in the future 
in this situation  sfas no 
requires nw natural to defer these items and show them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet until nw natural is allowed to charge its customers 
nw natural then amortizes these items as expense to the income statement as those charges are recovered from customers 
similarly  certain revenue items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities  which are also eventually amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced 
the conditions a regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting policies and practices of sfas no 
include o an independent regulator sets rates  o the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and o the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
nw natural applies sfas no 
in accounting for its regulated operations 
the company periodically assesses whether it can continue to apply sfas no 
if nw natural should determine in the future that all or a portion of its regulatory assets and liabilities no longer meet the criteria for continued application of sfas no 
 it would be required to write off the related balances of its regulatory assets as a charge to its income statement 
revenue recognition utility revenues are derived primarily from the sale and transportation of natural gas 
utility revenue from gas sales and transportation is recognized when the gas is delivered to and received by the customer 
estimated revenues are accrued for gas deliveries not billed to customers from meter reading dates to month end unbilled revenue and are reversed the following month when actual billings occur 
revenues recognized in  and included the net change in unbilled utility revenue of million  million and negative million  respectively 
revenues from non utility services  including gas storage services  are recognized upon delivery of the service to customers 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on jan 
 this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas no 
also requires that changes in the fair value of a derivative be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
nw natural s derivatives policy sets forth the guidelines for using selected financial derivative products to support prudent risk management strategies within designated parameters see note 
nw natural s primary hedging activities  ie natural gas commodity price and foreign currency exchange rates  are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
and are subject to regulatory deferral pursuant to sfas no 
unrealized gains and losses from mark to market valuations of these contracts are not recognized in the income statement but are reported as derivative assets or liabilities and offset by a corresponding deferred account balance included under regulatory assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 nw natural recorded a one time transition adjustment by debiting receivables from counterparties a regulatory asset account and crediting recoverable gas costs an offsetting regulatory asset account on the balance sheet for approximately million  representing the initial recognition of the fair values of hedge derivatives outstanding on the adoption date 
the financial statements for periods prior to do not reflect the requirements of sfas no 
at dec 
  nw natural had derivatives outstanding covering its exposures to commodity and foreign currency prices see note 
the fair value of the hedge derivatives outstanding on that date was a net loss of about million 
nw natural had six natural gas commodity price swap contracts extending beyond dec 
  but none extends longer than oct 
 none of the natural gas commodity price call option contracts extends beyond dec 
 in  nw natural realized net gains of million from the settlement of natural gas commodity price swap and call option contracts  which were recorded as reductions to the cost of gas  compared to net gains of million during the currency exchange rate in all foreign currency forward purchase contracts is included in nw natural s cost of gas at settlement  therefore  no gain or loss was recorded from the settlement of those contracts 
the fair value of derivative instruments at dec 
 was determined using estimated or quoted market prices for the periods covered by the contracts 
market prices for the natural gas commodity price swap and call option contracts were obtained from external sources 
these third party valuations are reviewed for reasonableness by the company using fair value calculations for other contracts with similar terms and conditions 
the market prices for the foreign currency forward contracts were based on the currency exchange rates quoted by the bank of canada 
results of operations regulatory matters nw natural provides gas utility service in oregon and washington  with oregon representing over percent of its revenues 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined largely by the pace of continued growth in the residential and commercial markets  the ability to remain price competitive in the large industrial market  to control expenses  and to obtain reasonable and timely regulatory ratemaking treatment for investments made in utility plant 
in october  the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc authorized a general rate increase totaling million per year  or percent 
the first million per year of the revenue increase  relating to costs allocated to washington under a new cost allocation study approved by the wutc and the public utility commission of oregon opuc  was effective on nov 
 the remaining increase of million per year became effective on oct 
 the wutc authorized and based rates on a return on common equity roe of percent 
in november  the opuc authorized a general rate increase of million per year  effective dec 
 higher revenues from rate increases averaging percent for residential customers were partially offset by rate decreases for certain industrial and large commercial customers 
the opuc authorized and based rates on an roe of percent 
on dec 
  rates were reduced in oregon by million per year to implement the cost allocation study that produced the equivalent rate increase in washington 
nw natural applies rate changes each year reflecting changes in its purchased gas costs  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize regulatory balancing accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective the previous year 
the opuc approved rate increases averaging percent for oregon sales customers and the wutc approved rate increases averaging percent for washington sales customers  both effective on oct 
 these rate increases primarily reflect increases in the costs of natural gas commodity purchased under contracts with gas producers see comparison of gas operations cost of gas  below 
also reflecting changes in nw natural s purchased gas costs  the opuc approved rate increases averaging percent effective oct 
  and increases averaging percent effective dec 
 the wutc approved rate increases averaging percent effective aug 
  and increases averaging percent effective dec 
 nw natural believes that reductions in recent years in its customers gas consumptions per degree day see residential and commercial  below are caused by the higher cost of purchased gas  which is passed on to customers as rate increases  and to efforts throughout the region to conserve energy 
nw natural filed with the opuc in for approval of a new regulatory mechanism that is intended to stabilize margin revenues in the face of variable consumption patterns 
the proposed regulatory mechanism is intended to stabilize margin revenues to assure nw natural of fixed cost recovery and more predictable shareholder earnings 
nw natural has proposed that this be accomplished through a balancing account that would compare actual usage of residential and commercial customers against their normal usage levels and treat any variations as refunds or collections of revenues 
in february  the administrative law judge in this proceeding issued a memorandum to the parties advising them that the opuc has decided to hold the docket regarding nw natural s proposed regulatory mechanism in abeyance  along with a docket involving a similar filing by pge  pending its review of nw natural s application to acquire pge 
nw natural estimates that if customers gas consumption patterns as experienced in were to continue for the full year but a margin stabilization mechanism were not approved  it could reduce margin revenues in by the equivalent of cents a share of earnings compared to results with a mechanism in place 
in an order issued in  the opuc formalized a process that tests for excessive earnings in connection with gas utilities annual filings for rate changes due to increases or decreases in gas costs 
the opuc confirmed nw natural s ability to pass through percent of its prudently incurred gas costs into rates 
under this order  nw natural is authorized to retain all of its earnings up to a threshold level equal to its authorized roe plus basis points 
one third of any earnings above that level will be refunded to customers 
the excess earnings threshold is subject to adjustment up or down each year depending on movements in interest rates 
comparison of gas operations the following table summarizes the composition of gas utility volumes and revenues for the three years ended dec 
thousands  except customers and degree days gas sales and transportation volumes therms residential and commercial sales    unbilled volumes    weather sensitive volumes    industrial firm sales    industrial interruptible sales    total gas sales    transportation deliveries    total volumes sold and delivered    utility operating revenues dollars residential and commercial sales    unbilled revenues    weather sensitive revenues    industrial firm sales    industrial interruptible sales    total gas sales    transportation revenues    other revenues    total utility operating revenues    cost of gas sold    total number of customers end of period    actual degree days    year average degree days    residential and commercial nw natural continued to grow its customer base  with  customers added during this represents a growth rate of percent  compared to percent in and percent in nw natural believes that the lower growth rate in reflects the effects of higher gas prices and the economic recession 
in the three years ended dec 
  more than  customers were added to the system  representing an average annual growth rate of percent 
typically  percent or more of nw natural s annual utility operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
accordingly  variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to and revenues derived from these customers 
weather conditions were percent colder than average in  percent colder than average in and percent colder than average in average weather conditions are calculated from the most recent years of temperature data measured by heating degree days 
weather in was percent warmer than while was percent colder than the volumes of gas sold to residential and commercial customers were percent lower in than in  reflecting warmer weather as well as lower consumption patterns by customers due to higher gas commodity prices tracked into rates in the fall of and again in october lower consumptions per degree day by temperature sensitive customers reduced sales for the year by an estimated million therms and reduced margin revenues less cost of gas by approximately million  equivalent to cents a share 
the volumes of gas sold to residential and commercial customers were percent higher in than in  reflecting the continued customer growth and colder weather 
revenue from residential and commercial customers was up percent in due to rate increases effective in and  and up percent in due to increased volumes and rate increases effective in and in order to match revenues with related purchased gas costs  nw natural records unbilled revenues for gas delivered but not yet billed to customers through the end of the period 
amounts reported as unbilled revenues reflect the increase or decrease in the balance of unbilled revenues over the prior year end 
year end balances are affected by weather conditions  rate changes and customer billing dates from one period to the next 
industrial sales  transportation and other revenues total volumes of gas delivered to industrial and electric generation customers were percent lower in than in and percent lower in than in during  industrial volumes included million therms delivered to electric generation customers  up from million therms in and million therms in the overall decline in industrial sales and transportation volumes during was due to several large customers switching to oil from gas and to plant shut downs and cut backs in the manufacturing sector because of economic conditions 
contracts for service to three electric generation customers contributed million of margin in  or cents a share  compared to margin from electric generation of million and million in and  respectively 
industrial revenues in included the positive effects of higher oil prices in an industrial schedule in which rates vary with oil prices 
other revenues include amortizations from regulatory accounts and miscellaneous fee income 
in  other revenues amounted to a net reduction to utility operating revenues of million  including amortizations from regulatory accounts covering conservation programs million  year costs million and property taxes million  partially offset by increased revenues from customer late payment and collection fees million and miscellaneous revenues million 
in  other revenues amounted to a net reduction to utility operating revenues of million  including amortizations from regulatory accounts covering conservation programs million  property taxes million and year costs million  partially offset by increased revenues from customer late payment and collection fees million and miscellaneous revenues million 
cost of gas the cost per therm of gas sold was percent higher in than in  and percent higher in than in  primarily due to higher prices in the natural gas commodity market 
the cost per therm of gas sold includes gas purchases  gas drawn from storage inventory  gains or losses from commodity hedges  demand costs  regulatory deferrals and company use 
nw natural uses an active natural gas commodity hedge program under the terms of its derivatives policy see note to help manage its gas commodity costs 
during  realized net gains from commodity swap and call option contracts were million  compared to net gains of million in net losses of million were realized in the fourth quarter of  compared to net gains of million in the fourth quarter of gains losses from commodity hedges are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas 
nw natural has a purchased gas adjustment pga tariff under which its net income from oregon operations is affected within defined limits by changes in purchased gas costs 
nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to projections 
the remaining percent of the higher or lower gas costs are recorded as deferred debits or credits regulatory assets or liabilities for recovery from or refund to customers in future rates 
net savings realized from gas purchases in totaled million  of which million was deferred for refund to customers and million was recorded to earnings 
these gas cost savings contributed cents a share to earnings in  while excess gas costs in reduced earnings by cents a share 
under an agreement with the opuc  revenues from off system gas sales are treated as a reduction of gas costs 
these sales reduced the cost of gas sold by million in  million in and million in non utility operations at dec 
 and  the company had one active wholly owned subsidiary  financial corporation 
northwest energy  which was formed in to serve as the holding company for nw natural and pge if the acquisition of pge is completed  had no active operations in one discontinued segment  canor  a majority owned subsidiary  was sold in see discontinued segment  below 
financial corporation financial corporation s operating results in were net income of million  compared to million in and million in the increase in net income from to was related to operating results from financial corporation s investments in limited partnerships in solar electric  wind power electric and hydroelectric generation projects in california 
the decrease in income from to was primarily due to an adjustment to deferred taxes in the company s investment in financial corporation at dec 
  was million  compared to million and million at dec 
 and  respectively 
discontinued segment during  the company sold its interest in canor at a gain of million  equivalent to cents a share see note 
net income from canor for was million 
gas storage services nw natural realized net income from gas storage services in of million  or cents a share  up from million  or negligible earnings per share in gas storage services are provided to customers using storage capacity not required from time to time for utility services 
nw natural retains percent of the net income before tax from storage services and credits the remaining percent to its utility customers 
operating expenses operations and maintenance consolidated operations and maintenance expenses were million  or percent  higher in than in the increase was caused primarily by higher payroll costs due to wage and salary increases million  higher costs for employees health and pension benefits million  a charge to a litigation reserve million resulting from an unfavorable decision by the oregon supreme court in a case involving a claim by a commercial customer see note and higher uncollectible accounts expense million 
operations and maintenance expenses in were million  or percent  higher than in the increase was primarily due to credits to a litigation reserve in million  increased payroll costs million and accruals for environmental claims million in  partially offset by a lower bonus accrual million in taxes other than income taxes other than income  which are comprised of property  franchise  payroll and other taxes  increased million  or percent  in property tax expense was million  or percent  higher than in due to higher property tax rates and an increase in utility plant 
franchise taxes  which are based on gross revenues  increased million  or percent  reflecting higher revenues due to an increase in nw natural s customer base and rate increases effective in late and regulatory fees and payroll tax expenses accounted for the remaining million increase in taxes other than income increased million  or percent  in compared to franchise taxes increased million  or percent  reflecting higher revenues due to an increase in nw natural s customer base and rate increases effective in late and property tax expense was million  or percent  higher than in due to increased plant in service 
payroll tax expense was million  or percent  higher than in due to increased payroll 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million  or percent  in  primarily due to a percent million increase in utility plant and non utility property 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense decreased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to charges in nw natural s depreciation expense relating to regulatory treatment of a customer information system cis 
cis assets were written down by million in pursuant to the opuc s order in the oregon general rate case concluded in november  and by a further million in pursuant to the wutc s order in the washington general rate case concluded in october exclusive of these regulatory mandated charges  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million  or percent  in compared to due to an increase in utility plant 
as a percentage of average plant and property  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was percent in both and and percent in other income other income was million in  or million lower than in  primarily due to lower interest income on deferred regulatory account balances million and lower miscellaneous non operating income million 
other income was million in  million lower than in  primarily due to a reduction in interest income on deferred regulatory account balances 
interest charges net net interest expense was million higher in than in exclusive of a million charge to interest expense as the result of an unfavorable litigation decision see note  interest expense decreased million in due to lower average interest rates 
interest charges increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to an increase in long term debt outstanding in and a million credit adjustment in relating to favorable decisions in litigation 
allowance for funds used during construction afudc represents the cost of funds used during the construction of utility plant see note 
in  afudc reduced interest expense by million compared to million in and million in the weighted average afudc rates were percent in and percent in both and see financing activities  below 
income taxes the effective corporate income tax rates for  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
redeemable preferred and preference stock dividend requirements redeemable preferred and preference stock dividend requirements for and were both lower by million  or percent  compared to and  respectively  due to annual sinking fund redemptions 
financial condition capital structure the company s goal is to maintain a capital structure comprised of to percent common stock equity  to percent preferred and preference stock and to percent short term and long term debt 
when additional capital is required  debt or equity securities are issued depending upon both the target capital structure and market conditions 
these sources also are used to meet long term debt and preferred and preference stock redemption requirements see notes and 
liquidity and capital resources at dec 
  the company had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at dec 
 short term liquidity is provided by cash from operations and from the sale of the company s commercial paper notes  which are supported by commercial bank lines of credit see note 
the company has available through sept 
 committed lines of credit totaling million 
the company s lines of credit are renewed annually 
nw natural s lines of credit require that credit ratings be maintained in effect at all times and that notice be given of any change in its commercial paper ratings 
a change in nw natural s commercial paper rating is not an event of default  nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of credit rating a condition to drawing upon the lines of credit 
however  interest rates on any loans outstanding under nw natural s bank lines are tied to credit ratings  which would increase or decrease the cost of bank debt  if any  when ratings are changed 
the lines of credit require nw natural to maintain a specified ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization 
failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the banks to terminate their lending commitments and to accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding 
at dec 
  nw natural was in compliance with this covenant 
the following table shows nw natural s contractual obligations by maturity and type of obligation commercial paper thousands supported by capital long term gas total payments due in years lines of preferred and long term lease operating supply purchase contractual ending dec 
 credit preference stock debt obligations leases obligations cash obligations total        thereafter      less imputed interest   total        one of financial corporation s lines of credit in the amount of million  which is guaranteed by nw natural  provides that it is an event of default if any governmental authority takes action which the bank believes has a material adverse effect on nw natural s financial condition or ability to repay  or if a material adverse change occurs in nw natural s business condition 
nw natural s capital expenditures are primarily related to utility construction resulting from customer growth and system improvements 
over the five year period through  these expenditures are estimated at between million and million 
in addition  nw natural has certain long term contractual obligations that require an adequate source of funding 
these capital and contractual expenditures are financed through cash from operations and from the issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
there are no credit rating triggers or stock price provisions that require the acceleration of debt repayment under the company s mortgage and deed of trust or other long term indebtedness 
also  there are no rating triggers or stock price provisions contained in contracts or other agreements with third parties  except for commodity price swap agreements with two approved counter parties under nw natural s derivatives policy  which require the affected party to provide substitute collateral such as cash  guaranty or letters of credit if credit ratings are lowered to non investment grade 
the company has no other material off balance sheet obligations  except for certain lease and purchase commitments see table above  and note 
the financing commitment obtained to provide loans to finance the cash portion of the purchase price for pge requires  as a condition to making such loans  that pge  nw natural and holding company have credit ratings meeting specified levels at the time such loans are to be made and that other criteria of expected financial performance be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the lenders 
cash flows operating activities continuing operations provided net cash of million in compared to million in the percent decrease was due to increased cash from operations before working capital changes million  offset by higher working capital requirements million 
the increase in cash from continuing operations before working capital changes was due to a larger decrease in deferred gas costs million  an increase in income from continuing operations million and an increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization in million  partially offset by a decrease in deferred investment tax credits and income taxes million and a smaller decrease in regulatory accounts and other million 
the increase in working capital requirements was due to a decrease in accounts payable million  partially offset by smaller increases in other current assets and liabilities million  accounts receivable million  inventories million  accrued unbilled revenues million  and a larger increase in accrued interest and taxes million 
cash provided by continuing operations in was million compared to million in an increase in cash from operations before working capital changes million was offset by higher working capital requirements million 
the reduction in cash provided by continuing operations between and was primarily due to cash flows relating to nw natural s construction pursuant to a development contract of a new headquarters building for the port of portland 
progress payments by the port totaling million in had the effect of reducing working capital requirements in that year 
the port s final payment of million at closing on the sale of the building in increased working capital requirements by that amount in cash used in construction of the building was recorded in both and as an investment in non utility property see investing activities  below 
nw natural used a portion of the port s progress payments to pay off the balance outstanding under a bank line of credit arranged for construction of the building million  contributing to a reduction in short term debt in the company has lease and purchase commitments relating to its operating activities which are financed with cash flows from operations see note 
investing activities cash requirements for investing activities in totaled million  up from million in  primarily due to proceeds from the sales of canor million and the port of portland building million in cash requirements for utility construction totaled million  down million from the decrease in cash requirements for utility construction in was primarily the result of the completion of another phase in the expansion of nw natural s mist gas storage system in december million 
cash requirements for investing activities in totaled million  down from million in cash requirements for utility construction totaled million  down million from the decrease in cash requirements for utility construction in resulted primarily from lower expenditures for completion of another expansion of the mist gas storage system million  lower construction overhead million and reduced expenditures for computer hardware and software million 
nw natural s utility construction expenditures are estimated to total million for over the five year period through  these expenditures are estimated at between million and million 
the level of capital expenditures over the next five years reflects projected customer growth  system replacement and reinforcement projects  and the development of additional gas storage facilities including the extension of a pipeline that moves gas from nw natural s mist storage field into growing portions of its service area 
an estimated percent of the required funds is expected to be internally generated over the five year period  with the remainder funded through a combination of long term debt and equity securities with short term debt providing liquidity and bridge financing 
investments in non utility property in million and million included expenditures for the company s gas storage expansion project utilized for interstate storage services 
investments in non utility property in also included final payments for the construction of the port of portland building 
total proceeds from the sale of the building in million were recognized as proceeds from sale of assets 
investing activities in also included million in financial advisory and legal fees  loan arrangement fees and other costs relating to the company s contract for the purchase of pge 
in the event that the acquisition is terminated  the company would recognize these costs as current expenses 
the discontinued segment provided net cash of million in from the sale of canor 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities in totaled million  compared to cash used in financing activities in of million 
factors contributing to the million difference were retirements of long term debt of million in compared to million in  and an increase in short term debt million in compared to a reduction in short term debt million in  partially offset by a reduction in long term debt issued million in compared to million 
cash used in financing activities in totaled million  compared to cash provided by financing activities in of million 
factors contributing to the million difference were retirements of long term debt of million in compared to million in  and a reduction in short term debt million in compared to an increase in short term debt million in  partially offset by an increase in long term debt issued million in nw natural sold million of its secured medium term notes  series b mtns  in june and used the proceeds  together with a million increase in short term borrowings  to re fund long term debt million and provide cash for investments in utility plant 
nw natural sold million of its mtns in it used million of the proceeds to redeem higher cost debt  million to re fund maturing long term debt and the remainder to meet capital requirements for the company s ongoing construction program and to reduce short term debt 
in may  the company commenced a program to repurchase up to million shares  or up to million in value  of nw natural s common stock through a repurchase program which has been extended through may the purchases are made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the company used million for the repurchase of  shares under the program in no shares were repurchased during the six months ended dec 
 while the company was negotiating the purchase of pge 
since the program s inception in  the company has repurchased  shares of common stock at a total cost of million 
ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended dec 
  and  the company s ratios of earnings to fixed charges  computed using the securities and exchange commission method  were  and  respectively 
for this purpose  earnings consist of net income before taxes plus fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest on all indebtedness  the amortization of debt expense and discount or premium  and the estimated interest portion of rentals charged to income 
contingent liabilities environmental matters nw natural owns property in linnton  oregon that is the site of a former gas manufacturing plant that was closed in the linnton site 
in recent years  the linnton site has been under voluntary investigation by nw natural for environmental contaminants under program oversight by the oregon department of environmental quality odeq 
nw natural has recorded liabilities totaling million for the estimated costs of investigation and interim remediation at the linnton site  including consultants fees  odeq oversight reimbursement and legal fees  of which million had been spent as of dec 
 in  nw natural recorded a million receivable representing an estimate of the costs for investigation and interim remediation at the linnton site that nw natural expects to recover from insurance 
nw natural previously owned property adjacent to the linnton site that now is the location of a manufacturing plant owned by wacker siltronic corporation the wacker site 
in october  the odeq issued an order requiring wacker and nw natural to determine the nature and extent of releases of hazardous substances to willamette river sediments from the wacker site 
nw natural has recorded a liability of million for its estimated costs of the investigation and initial remediation on the wacker site 
in  the odeq and the us environmental protection agency epa completed a study of sediments in a mile segment of the willamette river the portland harbor that includes the area adjacent to the linnton site and the wacker site 
in  the epa listed the portland harbor as a superfund site and notified the company that it is a potentially responsible party 
nw natural recorded a liability of million in and  based on a revised estimate of nw natural s share of the lower end of a range of probable liability  recorded an additional million in for its estimated share of the costs of remedial investigation of the portland harbor 
available information is insufficient to determine either the total amount of liability for investigation and remediation of the portland harbor or the higher end of a range for nw natural s estimated share of that liability 
nw natural expects that its costs of further investigation and remediation for which it may be responsible with respect to the linnton site  the wacker site and the portland harbor superfund site  if any  should be recoverable  in large part  from insurance 
in the event these costs are not recovered from insurance  nw natural will seek recovery through future rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposures associated with activities involving derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments are natural gas commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk 
derivative financial instruments are used as tools to mitigate certain of these market risks see note 
such instruments are used for hedging purposes  not for trading purposes 
market risks associated with the derivative financial instruments are monitored by management personnel who do not directly enter into these contracts and by a committee of the board of directors 
physical and financial commodity  foreign currency and interest rate transactions nw natural enters into short term and long term natural gas purchase contracts with demand and commodity fixed price and floating price components  along with associated short term and long term natural gas transportation contracts 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against foreign exchange rate fluctuations on purchases made under these contracts that are denominated in canadian dollars 
historically  nw natural has taken physical delivery of at least the minimum quantities specified in its natural gas purchase contracts 
the contracts are subject to annual re pricing  a process that is intended to reflect anticipated market price trends during the next year 
nw natural s pga mechanism in oregon provides for the recovery from customers of actual commodity costs in comparison with established benchmark costs  except that nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to projections 
at dec 
  differences between notional values and fair values with respect to nw natural s open positions in derivative financial instruments were not material to the company s financial position or results of operations because of the treatment of these instruments in regulatory mechanisms relating to gas costs see cost of gas  above  and notes and 
however  to the degree that market risks exist due to potential adverse changes in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates in relation to these financial and physical contracts  the company considers the risks to be commodity price risk the prices of natural gas commodity are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  pipeline transportation congestion and other factors that affect short term supply and demand 
natural gas commodity swap and cap agreements are used to convert certain long term gas purchase contracts from floating prices to fixed prices 
at dec 
 and  notional amounts under natural gas commodity swap and cap agreements totaled million and million  respectively 
as of dec 
  six commodity agreements extended beyond dec 
 if all of the commodity swap and cap agreements had been settled on dec 
  a loss of million would have been realized see note 
foreign currency risk the costs of natural gas commodity and certain pipeline services purchased from canadian suppliers are subject to changes in the value of canadian currency in relation to u
