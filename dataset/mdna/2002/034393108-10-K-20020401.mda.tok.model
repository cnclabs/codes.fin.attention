item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing we employ a sales staff as well as outside sales representative organizations to market our andrea anti noise products  our andrea dsp microphone and software products and our aircraft communications products 
andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products are marketed to computer oems  distributors of personal computers and telecommunications equipment  software publishers  and end users in both business and household environments 
these products are sold to end users through distributors and value added resellers  software publishers  internet service providers and internet content developers 
under our existing collaborative agreements  our collaborators have various marketing and sales rights to our andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone and software products 
we are seeking to enter additional collaborative arrangements for marketing and selling our andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products  but we cannot assure that we will be successful in these efforts 
market acceptance of the andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products is critical to our success 
we market our aircraft communications products to oems  military organizations  and industrial customers 
production operations we conduct assembly operations at our new york facility and through subcontractors 
during initial production runs of andrea anti noise products  we assemble the products at our new york facility from purchased components 
as sales of any particular andrea anti noise product increase  assembly operations are transferred to a subcontractor in asia 
most of the components for the andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products are available from several sources and are not characteristically in short supply 
however  certain specialized components  such as microphones and dsp boards  are available from a limited number of suppliers and subject to long lead times 
to date we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components  but we cannot assure that we will continue to be able to do so 
shortages of  or interruptions in  the supply of these more specialized components could have a material adverse effect on our sales of andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products 
we assemble our aircraft communications products at our new york facility from purchased components 
certain highly specialized components for our aircraft communications products sold for military and industrial use have limited sources of supply  the availability of which can affect particular products 
we do not believe  however  that our earnings have been  or will be  materially affected due to unavailability of these components 
competition the markets for our andrea anti noise products  andrea dsp microphone and software products and aircraft communications products are highly competitive 
competition in these markets is based on varying combinations of product features  quality and reliability of performance  price  sales  marketing and technical support  ease of use  compatibility with evolving industry standards and other systems and equipment  name recognition  and development of new products and enhancements 
most of our current and potential competitors in these markets have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical  and other resources than us 
consequently  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  marketing  and sale of their products than we can 
we cannot assure that one or more of these competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
we have incurred significant price pressure  as well as  more recently  a significant decline in unit sales of andrea anti noise products to our oem customer base shipping continuous speech dictation products 
we attribute this decline to increasing competition as well as our ongoing strategic efforts to focus on being primarily a leading supplier of high end  digital based  far field microphone technologies 
in response to these factors  we formulated a plan to exit from an increasingly unprofitable pc headset channel within andrea s anti noise headset product segment 
as a result of exiting this customer channel  we recorded charges approximating million during the fourth quarter of in the markets for our aircraft communications products  we often compete with major defense electronics corporations as well as smaller manufacturing firms which specialize in supplying to specific military initiatives 
our performance in these markets is further subject to several factors  including dependence on government appropriations  the time required for design and development  the complexity of product design  the rapidity with which product designs and technology become obsolete  the intense competition for available business  and the acceptability of manufacturing contracts by government inspectors 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend upon our capability to develop and maintain advanced technology  develop proprietary products  attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies  and manufacture  assemble and market products  either alone or through third parties  in a profitable manner 
employees at december   we had employees  of whom were engaged in production and related operations  were engaged in research and development  and were engaged in management  administration  sales and customer support duties 
none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that we generally enjoy good relations with our employees 
during the first quarter of  we undertook steps to reduce the number of our employees 
for more information about this reduction  please see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item properties andrea s corporate headquarters is located in melville  new york 
our corporate headquarters is located in approximately  square feet of leased space which houses our production operations  research and development activities  sales  administration and executive offices 
we also lease facilities in utah and israel dedicated for research and development  and in hong kong for production management and limited research and development activities 
we believe that we maintain our machinery  equipment and tooling in good operating condition and that these assets are adequate for our current business and adequately insured 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our property  plant and equipment and leased facilities 
item legal proceedings we are presently engaged in a lawsuit filed in the us district court for the eastern district of new york by nct group  inc nct and its subsidiary nct hearing products  inc nct alleges that we engaged in unfair competition by misrepresenting the scope our patents  specifically  us pat 
nos 
  and  thereby tortuously interfering with prospective contractual rights between nct and its existing and potential customers  made false and disparaging statements about nct and its products  and falsely advertised andrea s anr products 
the complaint requests a declaration that these patents are invalid and unenforceable and that nct s products do not infringe upon these patents and seeks to enjoin andrea from engaging in these alleged activities and seeks compensatory damages of not less than million  punitive damages of not less than million and plaintiffs costs and attorneys fees 
we have filed and served an answer to the nct complaint  denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims 
our counterclaims  as amended  allege that nct has willfully infringed the above mentioned patents  and that nct has engaged in trademark infringement  false designation of origin  and unfair competition 
the counterclaims seek injunctive relief with respect to the allegations of patent infringement  trademark infringement  false designation of origin and unfair competition 
we are also seeking exemplary and punitive damages  prejudgment interest on all damages  costs  reasonable attorneys fees and expenses 
during the third quarter of  the court held a markman hearing to determine the meaning of the claims in the three andrea patents 
we are unable to anticipate when the court will issue a decision on this question 
if this suit is ultimately resolved in favor of nct  we could be materially adversely effected 
we believe  however  that nct s allegations are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend andrea and to assert against nct the claims described above 
in addition to the litigation described above  we are from time to time subject to routine litigation incidental to our business

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our mission is to provide the emerging voice interface markets with state of the art communications products that facilitate natural language  human machine interfaces 
examples of the applications and interfaces for which andrea dsp microphone and software products and andrea anti noise r products provide benefit include internet and other computer based speech  telephony communications  multi point conferencing  speech recognition  multimedia  multi player internet and cd rom interactive games  military and commercial aircraft communications  and other applications and interfaces that incorporate natural language processing 
we believe that end users of these applications and interfaces will require high quality microphone and earphone products that enhance voice transmission  particularly in noisy environments  for use with personal computers  mobile personal computing devises  military and commercial aircraft systems  cellular and other wireless communication devices and automotive communication systems 
our andrea dsp microphone and software products use far field digital signal processing technology to provide high quality transmission of voice where the user is at a distance from the microphone 
high quality audio communication technologies will be required for emerging far field voice applications  ranging from continuous speech dictation  to internet telephony and multiparty video teleconferencing and collaboration  to natural language driven interfaces for automobiles  home and office automation and other machines and devices into which voice controlled microprocessors are expected to be introduced during the next several years 
in order to complement our internal efforts to develop digital signal processing technology  in may  we acquired lamar signal processing  ltd  an israeli corporation engaged in the development of dsp noise cancellation microphone solutions for voice driven interfaces covering a wide range of audio and acoustic applications 
this acquisition resulted in a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the amortization of the goodwill and other intangible assets has a significant  negative  non cash impact on our results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we outsource the assembly of most of our andrea anti noise r products from purchased components  and we are currently assembling our andrea dsp microphone and software products from purchased components at our new york and israeli facilities 
we manufacture our aircraft communications products at our new york facility 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements certain information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  and other items set forth in this report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  plans  seeks  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and industry  our beliefs and certain assumptions made by our management 
investors are cautioned that matters subject to forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including economic  competitive  governmental  technological and other factors that may affect our business and prospects 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
in order to obtain the benefits of these safe harbor provisions for any such forward looking statements  we wish to caution investors and prospective investors about the following significant factors  which  among others  have in some cases affected our actual results and are in the future likely to affect our actual results and could cause them to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements 
these factors include because our operating results are subject to significant fluctuation  period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on them as indications of our future performance 
our results of operations have historically been and are subject to continued substantial annual and quarterly fluctuations 
the causes of these fluctuations include  among other things the volume of sales of our products under our collaborative marketing arrangements  the cost of development of our products under our collaborative development arrangements  the mix of products we sell  the mix of distribution channels we use  the timing of our new product releases and those of our competitors  fluctuations in the computer and communications hardware and software marketplace  and general economic conditions 
we cannot assure that the level of sales and gross profit  if any  that we achieve in any particular fiscal period will not be significantly lower than in other fiscal periods 
our revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million versus million in the prior year 
net loss applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was approximately million  or per share on a diluted basis  versus net loss applicable to common shareholders of approximately million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  we continued to experience a significant decline in our sales of andrea anti noise products as a result of increased competition with respect to a specific customer channel 
in response to this decline  as well as our overall shift in strategic direction to deliver digital  far field microphone solutions  during the fourth quarter of  we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million 
this restructuring is expected to result in a further decrease in sales during fiscal we are examining additional opportunities for cost reduction  production efficiencies and further diversification of our business 
but to remain competitive  we intend to continue incurring substantial research and development  marketing and general and administrative expenses 
we may not be able to easily and quickly reduce these expenses if our sales revenue falls below our expectations and  therefore  our net income or loss may be disproportionately affected by any reduction in sales revenue 
furthermore  our acquisition in of lamar signal processing  ltd 
resulted in a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the amortization of these intangible assets has had  and will continue to have  a negative  non cash impact on our results of operations other than goodwill 
as a result of these factors  we expect to continue to accumulate losses and the market price of our common stock could decline 
if we fail to obtain additional capital or maintain access to funds sufficient to meet our operating needs  we may be required to significantly reduce  sell  or refocus  our operations and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely effected  and could result in our delisting on the american stock exchange or inability to continue operations 
in recent years  we have sustained significant operating losses 
we have been unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs and  correspondingly  from time to time during the past several years  we have raised additional capital from external sources 
we expect to continue to have to raise additional capital from external sources 
these sources may include private or public financings through the issuance of debt  convertible debt or equity  or collaborative arrangements 
additional capital and funding may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
additionally  we may only be able to obtain additional capital or funds through arrangements that require us to relinquish rights to our products  technologies or potential markets  in whole or in part  or result in the sale of andrea 
additionally  andrea s funding and capital raising efforts could trigger change in control payments due to certain executive officers of andrea under their employment contracts or redemptions of the company s series b and series c redeemable convertible preferred stock 
given our current financial condition and market conditions  it may be difficult to attract additional financings on favorable terms  or at all  as compared to prior periods 
we have revised our business strategies to reduce our expenses and capital expenditures  but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining financings or access to additional sources of funding in amounts necessary to continue our operations 
failure to maintain sufficient access to funding may also result in our delisting from the american stock exchange 
we face the risk that andrea could be required to redeem the series c redeemable convertible preferred stock on october   andrea issued and sold in a private placement  of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock the series c preferred stock 
the series c preferred stock is convertible or redeemable at maturity by the company  based upon certain circumstances at that time  and is redeemable by the holder upon certain events  including the announcement of a major transaction  as defined n the certificate of amendment  or upon certain other triggering events 
on march   andrea announced that a triggering event had occurred and that andrea was seeking a waiver from the series c preferred stock holders 
a final agreement regarding the waiver arrangement was reached on march  the waiver related to the existing triggering event  as well as certain possible future triggering events  however  the waiver will be null and void upon the earlier of april   the first date on which andrea fails to comply in any material respect with the terms of the waiver and related documents  and the first date on which andrea is insolvent 
as consideration for the series c preferred stock holder s agreement to waive its current and  in certain circumstances  any future right to receive the aggregate triggering event redemption price for the series c preferred stock  andrea agreed to grant a security interest in all of andrea s assets 
however  the series c preferred stock holder agreed to have its lien on andrea s assets subordinated to any lien granted in the future to a non affiliated third party in connection with a strategic transaction with a financing component  provided that such third party lien relates only to the amount of the financing component of such transactions  and any lien granted in the future to a bank or other similar institution pursuant to any asset based financing transaction 
in addition  the series c preferred stock holder agreed to release its lien in connection with any sale of any assets subject to its lien  provided they receive a lien on the proceeds of the sale 
the series c preferred stock holder acknowledged that its lien in any portion of andrea s intellectual property is effectively subordinate to the interest of any current or future licensee of such intellectual property  as any interest the investor may have in such intellectual property cannot be greater than andrea s interest therein 
given that the waiver granted by the series c preferred stock holder does not cover all triggering events that could require the redemption of the series c preferred stock  and that the waiver will be null and void in the event andrea fails to comply in any material respect with the terms of the agreements relating to the waiver  among other things  there is a risk that the series c preferred stock holder could declare a triggering event that would trigger the redemption rights 
if such redemption rights are triggered and andrea has insufficient funds to satisfy the redemption  andrea will be requested to obtain a new waiver from the holder of the series c preferred stock 
if no such waiver can be obtained  andrea s ability to continue its current operations will be materially adversely affected and if andrea has insufficient funds to redeem the series c preferred stock  it could result in andrea s inability to meet its operating obligations and  consequently  delisting from the american stock exchange 
shares eligible for future sale may have an adverse effect on market price  you may experience substantial dilution 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could have the effect of depressing the prevailing market price of our common stock 
of the  shares of common stock presently authorized   were outstanding as of march  this does not include  shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding awards granted under our performance equity plan and stock plan  and shares of our common stock reserved for further awards under the stock plan 
in addition  this does not include  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of the series b and series c convertible preferred stock and exercise of related warrants 
furthermore  in may  we issued  shares of common stock as part of the consideration for our acquisition of lamar signal processing  ltd 
trading restrictions on these  shares have expired and are subject to demand and piggyback registration rights 
to date   of the  shares have been registered for sale under the securities act of conversions of our series b convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock may result in substantial dilution to other holders of our common stock 
as of march   we had shares of series b convertible preferred stock and shares of series c convertible preferred stock outstanding 
both the series b convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock are convertible into shares of common stock  subject to ownership limitations that prohibit the holders of the preferred stock from owning more than of the outstanding shares of common stock at the time of conversion or over the sixty day period prior to the conversion 
these restrictions do not prevent purchasers from converting and selling some of their holdings and then later converting the rest of their holdings 
as the price of our common stock decreases  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our series b convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock increases 
the variable conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock and any reset of the conversion price of the series c convertible preferred stock are functions of the market price of our common stock 
if the price of our common stock decreases over time  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each series will increase 
the following table illustrates the varying amounts of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of series b convertible preferred stock at the indicated conversion prices without regard to any limitations on conversion and assuming that the additional amount is paid in cash number of shares of common stock percentage of outstanding conversion price issuable upon conversion common stock the series b holder is prohibited from converting its holdings of the series b convertible preferred stock if after giving effect to such conversion it would beneficially own in excess of or  over the sixty day period prior to the conversion  of the outstanding shares of our common stock following such conversion 
the numbers in this column do not reflect these limitations 
based on  shares of common stock outstanding as of march  the following table illustrates  as of any reset date and assuming the conversion price indicated is lower than the then applicable conversion price on that date  the varying amounts of shares of common stock that would be issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of series c convertible preferred stock at the indicated conversion prices without regard to any limitations on conversion and assuming that the additional amount is paid in cash number of shares of common stock percentage of outstanding conversion price issuable upon conversion common stock the series c holder is prohibited from converting its holdings of the series c convertible preferred stock if after giving effect to such conversion it would beneficially own in excess of or  over the sixty day period prior to the conversion  of the outstanding shares of our common stock following such conversion 
the numbers in this column do not reflect these limitations 
based on  shares of common stock outstanding as of march  the following table illustrates the varying amounts of shares of common stock that would be issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of series b convertible preferred stock and all outstanding shares of series c convertible preferred stock at the indicated conversion prices without regard to any limitations on conversion and assuming that all additional amounts are paid in cash number of shares of common stock percentage of outstanding common conversion price issuable upon conversion stock the calculation assumes that the conversion price of the series b and series c convertible preferred stock are the same at the assumed conversion prices of  
and 
this could only occur if the market price of andrea s common stock declines  and at a future reset date  the conversion price of the series c adjusts to the then prevailing market price the current fixed conversion price of the series c is  and such conversion price is fixed unless adjusted downward at a future reset date 
the calculation assumes that for any conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock when the prevailing market price is above  the series c would still be converted at its maximum conversion price of the series b and series c holder is prohibited from converting the series c or series b convertible preferred stock  or from exercising the warrants issued in connection with the series b convertible preferred stock  if after giving effect to such conversion it would beneficially own in excess of or  over the sixty day period prior to the conversion  of the outstanding shares of our common stock following such conversion 
based on  shares of common stock outstanding as of march  sales of an increased number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock resulting from a declining market price for our common stock can cause the market price of our common stock to decline further 
disregarding the manner in which the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock are sold as well as any other factors such as reactions to our operating results and general market conditions which may be operative in the market at such time  an increase in the number of shares of common stock eligible for sale can cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
this decrease could reduce the conversion prices of the series b convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock  leading to a further increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon future conversions and a further decline in our stock price 
short sales of our common stock may be attracted by or accompany conversions of series b convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock  which sales may cause downward pressure upon the price of our common stock 
short sales of our common stock may be attracted by or accompany the sale of converted common stock  which in the aggregate could cause downward pressure upon the price of the common stock  regardless of our operating results  thereby attracting additional short sales of the common stock 
the result of conversions of the series b and series c convertible preferred stock at declining conversion prices would be increasing and substantial dilution of the interests of the other holders of common stock 
if we fail to market and commercialize our andrea dsp microphone and software and andrea anti noise products  our revenues may not increase at a high enough rate to improve our results of operations or at all 
our business  results of operations and financial condition depend on successful commercialization of our andrea dsp microphone and software and andrea anti noise products and technologies 
since we began sales of the initial andrea anti noise products in  we have been expanding the number of products in this line 
we introduced our first andrea digital super directional array products in and we are initially targeting these and our other andrea dsp microphone and software products at the desktop computer market  the market for computer based automobile monitoring and control systems for use by drivers and passengers  and the mobile device market 
the success of these products is subject to the risks frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of product commercialization  particularly companies in the computing and communications industries 
if we are unable to obtain market acceptance of andrea dsp microphone and software products and technologies or if market acceptance of these products and technologies occurs at a slow rate  then our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we  and our competitors  are focused on developing and commercializing products and technologies that enhance the use of voice  particularly in noisy environments  for a broad range of computer and communications applications 
these products and technologies have been rapidly evolving and the number of our competitors has grown  but the markets for these products and technologies are subject to a high level of uncertainty and have been developing slowly 
we  alone or together with our industry  may be unsuccessful in obtaining market acceptance of these products and technologies 
if we fail to develop and successfully introduce new products and technologies in response to competition and evolving technology  we may not be able to attract new customers or retain current customers 
the markets in which we sell our andrea anti noise  andrea dsp microphone and software and our aircraft communication products are highly competitive 
we may not compete successfully with any of our competitors 
most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technology development  marketing  technical support and other resources than we do 
consequently  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  marketing  and sale of their products than we can 
one or more of these competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the introduction of products incorporating new technologies could render our products obsolete and unmarketable and could exert price pressures on existing products 
we are currently engaged in the development of digital signal processing products and technologies for the voice  speech and natural language interface markets 
we may not succeed in developing these new digital signal processing products and technologies  and any of these new digital signal processing products or technologies may not gain market acceptance 
in the markets for aircraft communications products  we often compete with major defense electronics corporations as well as smaller manufacturing firms  which specialize in supplying products and technologies for specific military initiatives 
further  the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by evolving industry standards and specifications that may require us to devote substantial time and expense to adapt our products and technologies 
we may not successfully anticipate and adapt our products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner to changes in technology and industry standards or to introductions of new products and technologies by others that render our then existing products and technologies obsolete 
if our marketing collaborators do not effectively market those of their products with which our products are included or incorporated  our sales growth could be adversely affected 
we have entered into several collaborative and distribution arrangements with software publishers and computer hardware manufacturers relating to the marketing and sale of andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products through inclusion or incorporation with the products of our collaborators 
our success will therefore be dependent to a substantial degree on the efforts of these collaborators to market those of their products with which our products are included or incorporated 
our collaborators may not successfully market these products 
in addition  our collaborators generally are not contractually obligated to any minimum level of sales of our products or technologies  and we have no control over their marketing efforts 
furthermore  our collaborators may develop their own microphone  earphone or headset products that may replace our products or technologies or to which they may give higher priority 
if we fail to maintain sales of aircraft communication products to the us government  we would experience a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are substantially dependent on product sales to the us government 
during the years ended december   and  the us government accounted for  and  respectively  of our net sales before sales returns restructuring 
the us government is not obligated to continue to purchase these products and is free to purchase similar products from our competitors 
our failure to maintain sales of aircraft communication products to the us government would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
shortages of  or interruptions in  the supply of more specialized components for our andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone products could have a material adverse effect on our sales of these products 
we conduct assembly operations at our facilities in new york and israel and through subcontractors using purchased components 
some specialized components for the andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone products  such as microphones and digital signal processing boards  are available from a limited number of suppliers and subject to long lead times 
we may not be able to continue to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components  particularly if our sales of andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone products increase substantially or market demand for these components otherwise increases 
if our subcontractor fails to meet our production and shipment schedules  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
we conduct assembly operations at our facilities in new york and israel and through subcontracting 
during initial production runs of andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone products  we perform assembly operations at our new york facility from purchased components 
as sales of any particular product increase  assembly operations are primarily transferred to a subcontractor in asia 
our ability to compete may be limited by our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property or by patents granted to third parties 
we rely on a combination of patents  patent applications  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  nondisclosure agreements with our employees  licensees and potential licensees  limited access to and dissemination of our proprietary information  and other measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
however  the steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent its misappropriation or circumvention 
in addition  numerous patents have been granted to other parties in the fields of noise cancellation  noise reduction  computer voice recognition  digital signal processing and related subject matter 
we expect that products in these fields will increasingly be subject to claims under these patents as the numbers of products and competitors in these fields grow and the functionality of products overlap 
claims of this type could have an adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market our products or to develop new products and technologies  because the parties holding these patents may refuse to grant licenses or only grant licenses with onerous royalty requirements 
moreover  the laws of other countries do not protect our proprietary rights to our technologies to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
an unfavorable ruling in any current litigation proceeding or future proceeding may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time we are subject to litigation incidental to our business 
for example  we are subject to the risk of adverse claims  interference proceedings before the us patent and trademark office  oppositions to patent applications outside the united states  and litigation alleging infringement of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation to establish the validity of patents  to assert infringement claims against others  and to defend against patent infringement claims can be expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is in our favor 
we are presently engaged in a lawsuit filed in the us district court for the eastern district of new york by nct group  inc nct and its subsidiary nct hearing products  inc nct alleges that we engaged in unfair competition by misrepresenting the scope our patents  specifically  us pat 
nos 
  and  thereby tortuously interfering with prospective contractual rights between nct and its existing and potential customers  made false and disparaging statements about nct and its products  and falsely advertised andrea s anr products 
the complaint requests a declaration that these patents are invalid and unenforceable and that nct s products do not infringe upon these patents and seeks to enjoin andrea from engaging in these alleged activities and seeks compensatory damages of not less than million  punitive damages of not less than million and plaintiffs costs and attorneys fees 
we have filed and served an answer to the nct complaint  denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims 
our counterclaims  as amended  allege that nct has willfully infringed the above mentioned patents  and that nct has engaged in trademark infringement  false designation of origin  and unfair competition 
the counterclaims seek injunctive relief with respect to the allegations of patent infringement  trademark infringement  false designation of origin and unfair competition 
we are also seeking exemplary and punitive damages  prejudgment interest on all damages  costs  reasonable attorneys fees and expenses 
during the third quarter of  the court held a markman hearing to determine the meaning of the claims in the three andrea patents 
we are unable to anticipate when the court will issue a decision on this question 
if this suit is ultimately resolved in favor of nct  we could be materially adversely effected 
we believe  however  that nct s allegations are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend andrea and to assert against nct the claims described above 
changes in economic and political conditions outside the united states could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have been seeking to increase our sales to regions outside the united states  particularly in europe and areas in the americas and asia 
for the year ended december   sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of our net sales 
international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks  including o trade restrictions in the form of license requirements  o restrictions on exports and imports and other government controls  o changes in tariffs and taxes  o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  o problems in establishing and managing distributor relationships  o general economic conditions  and o political and economic instability or conflict 
to date  we have invoiced our international sales in us dollars  and have not engaged in any foreign exchange or hedging transactions 
we may not continue to be able to invoice all our sales in us dollars and to avoid engaging in foreign exchange or hedging transactions 
if we are required to invoice any material amount of international sales in non us currencies  fluctuations in the value of non us currencies relative to the non us dollar may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition or require us to incur hedging costs to counter such fluctuations 
we face risk from operating in israel our principal research and development facility is located in the state of israel and  as a result  as of december   certain of our key research and development employees were located in israel 
although substantially all of our sales currently are being made to customers outside israel  we are nonetheless directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a state of hostility has existed  varying in degree and intensity  between israel and arab countries 
although israel has entered into various agreements with certain arab countries and the palestinian authority  and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the middle east  we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved 
if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary managerial  technical and other personnel necessary for our business  then our business  results of operations and financial condition will be harmed 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of these executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managers and technical personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales excluding the impact of restructuring charges  sales for the year ended december   were  a decrease of from sales of  for the year ended december  this decrease in sales reflects an approximate decrease in sales of andrea anti noise products to  or of total sales  offset by an approximate increase in sales of our aircraft communications products  to  or of total sales  and an approximate increase in sales of andrea dsp microphone and software products  to  or of total sales 
the primary reason for the decrease of andrea anti noise product sales during was a significant decline in headset unit shipments to ibm which was primarily a result of increased competition in the pc headset market  coupled with unfavorable economic conditions which continues to negatively impact the technology sector 
in response  during the fourth quarter  we formulated a plan to exit from an increasingly unprofitable pc headset channel within andrea s anti noise headset product segment 
this customer channel included ibm 
for the year ended december   excluding the impact of restructuring charges  sales to ibm and certain of ibm s affiliates accounted for approximately of our total sales  or  this reflects an approximate decrease from  for the year ended december  the increase in our aircraft communication product revenues is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing activities 
sales of andrea dsp microphone and software products were primarily comprised of shipments of andrea s far field microphone products for use with business videoconferencing systems  in vehicle communications systems  and desktop speech dictation applications 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded deferred revenues of million related to a license agreement for certain of our andrea dsp microphone and software technologies 
the deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of three years beginning march  cost of sales excluding the impact of restructuring charges  cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  remained consistent from the year ended december  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ending december  this decrease is due primarily to a reduction in expenses associated with research efforts that were determined not to be integral to andrea s core portfolio of digital microphone software and hardware technologies 
dsp microphone and software technology efforts were  or of total research and development expenses  aircraft communications technology efforts were  or of total research and development expenses and andrea anti noise product efforts were  or of total research and development expenses 
with respect to dsp microphone and software technologies  research efforts are primarily focused on the pursuit of commercializing a natural language driven human machine interface by developing optimal far field microphone solutions for various voice driven interfaces  incorporating our digital super directional array microphone technology dsda and certain other related technologies obtained through the acquisition of lamar in may we believe that the acquisition of lamar significantly reinforces its position in digital signal processing by extending our marketing programs to other high growth industries  including automotive telematics  mobile device markets  the business videoconferencing market and internet telephony  among others 
specifically  the core technology acquired produces noise filtering capabilities that management believes is preferred to other known dsp based technologies in the market  and is unattainable in products using traditional mechanical solutions 
in addition  the nature of a dsp based solution  together with the people acquired supporting our technology  offers a solution that is highly scalable and embeddable  and therefore enables the technology to be integrated into many different applications and form factors 
we believe that continued research and development spending will provide us with a competitive advantage 
for  we expect total research and development spending to approach levels similar to that of general  administrative and selling expenses excluding the impact of restructuring charges  general  administrative and selling expenses decreased approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to our cost reduction efforts which are aimed at cutting costs that are not integral to the execution of andrea s overall strategy  and to ensure conservative spending during the current period of economic uncertainty 
included in our cost reduction initiatives was a reduction in workforce which was implemented during february of  representing a reduction of approximately of andrea s then total workforce 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter  we committed to a defined plan of action and recorded restructuring charges relating to repositioning our business plan for our anti noise product business segment as part of our overall effort to drive high margin product sales and become profitable 
the restructuring focused on exiting from an increasingly unprofitable pc headset channel within andrea s anti noise headset product segment 
this was primarily a result of the increasing competitive nature of the pc headset market  coupled with andrea s ongoing strategic efforts to focus on being primarily a leading supplier of high end  digital based  far field microphone technologies 
this channel primarily purchased our lower end  low margin headset products  and required substantial support which  when combined with decreasing volumes realized during  became unprofitable 
the plan resulted in an aggregate restructuring charge of approximately million  and included the following sales returns restructuring reserve this charge  approximating thousand  reflects estimated sales returns activity related to exiting this customer channel 
cost of sales this charge  approximating million  relates to inventory obsolescence for products that we do not expect to sell as a result of exiting this activity 
other charges these charges  approximating million  relate to costs associated with exiting certain agreements  as well as impairment charges associated with abandoning related assets 
other income expense other income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease is due to lower cash balances coupled with unfavorable market conditions for those invested cash balances during provision for income taxes we did not record income tax expense for the year ending december  in light of the net loss recorded for the period 
furthermore  the realization of a portion of our reserved deferred tax assets  if and when realized  will not result in a tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations  but will result in an increase in additional paid in capital as they are related to tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options 
we will be continually re assessing its reserves on deferred income tax assets in future periods on a quarterly basis 
the determination as to the realization of additional reserves is  and will be  based on andrea s expectations of future earnings 
to the extent we believe that  more likely than not  previously reserved deferred tax assets will be realized  we will reduce the reserve accordingly

net loss net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  principally reflects the factors described above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  were  a decrease of from sales of  for the year ended december  the decrease in sales for the year ended december  reflects an approximate decrease in sales of andrea anti noise products to  or of total sales and an approximate decrease in sales of our aircraft communications products  to  or of total sales  both offset by initial sales of andrea dsp microphone and software products of  or of total sales 
the primary reasons for the decrease of andrea anti noise product sales during were a significant decline in headset unit shipments to ibm and  to a lesser extent  continued price pressures from ibm 
in addition  the decrease from reflects a decline in aircraft communication product sales as a result of a product transformation required to meet future demand for printed circuit and digital based intercom systems 
initial sales of andrea dsp microphone and software products were primarily comprised of shipments of andrea s far field microphone products for use with business videoconferencing systems  professional audio microphones and desktop speech dictation applications 
for the year ended december   sales of our computer headsets to one customer and certain of that customer s affiliates  distributors  licensees and integrators accounted for approximately of our total sales 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  this increase in cost of sales percentage is primarily a result of lower than expected andrea anti noise and aircraft communications production and sales described above under sales over which to spread our pool of fixed overhead costs 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ending december  this increase is due to our continuing efforts to develop its digital signal processing microphone and software technologies  coupled with  to a lesser extent  efforts in aircraft communication technologies 
research and development in dsp based technology at andrea is focused on the pursuit of commercializing a natural language driven human machine interface by developing optimal far field microphone solutions for various voice driven interfaces  incorporating andrea s array microphone technologies obtained through the acquisition of lamar signal processing  ltd 
lamar in may correspondingly  the activities of lamar accounted for approximately of the total research and development expenses during we believe that the acquisition of lamar significantly reinforces its position in digital signal processing by extending our marketing programs to other high growth industries  including automotive telematics  mobile device markets  the business videoconferencing market and internet telephony  among others

we believe that continued research and development spending will provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
for  we expect total research and development spending to approach levels similar to that of general  administrative and selling expenses general  administrative and selling expenses increased approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the slight increase was due to an increase in sales and marketing expenses during the second half of the year associated with sales efforts in the automotive telematics market  as well as increases in overall sales and marketing salaries 
we implemented a cost reduction plan aimed at cutting costs that are not integral to the execution of andrea s overall strategy  and to ensure conservative spending during the current period of economic uncertainty 
included in our cost reduction initiatives was a reduction in workforce which was implemented during february of  representing a reduction of approximately of andrea s then total workforce 
other income expense other income for the year ended december  was  compared to other expense of  for the year ended december  the increase is due to interest earned on higher cash balances throughout  coupled with other miscellaneous income generated during provision for income taxes we did not record income tax expense for the year ending december  in light of the net loss recorded for the period 
furthermore  the realization of a portion of our reserved deferred tax assets  if and when realized  will not result in a tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations  but will result in an increase in additional paid in capital as they are related to tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options

see note to our consolidated financial statements 
net loss net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  principally reflects the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources andrea s principal sources of funds have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  gross cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of convertible notes  preferred stock or other securities to certain financial institutions or potential industry partners 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  compared with  at december  the balance of cash and cash equivalents at december   is primarily a result of andrea s issuance and sale in a private placement of  of its series c redeemable convertible preferred stock the series c preferred stock in october andrea is using the net proceeds from the issuance of the series c preferred stock primarily for costs associated with research and development  creating and maintaining strategic alliances  which includes  among other things  sales and marketing salaries  substantial travel costs to market our products and technologies  product fulfillment costs and technical assistance  and other general support costs for existing and potential partners  payment of certain debt obligations  professional fees  and general working capital requirements 
in connection with the acquisition of lamar  of the aggregate cash consideration to be paid by andrea   was paid on may   the closing date  and  was paid on each of the six  twelve  twenty four and thirty six month anniversaries of the closing date 
the final payment was paid on may  working capital at december  was  compared to  at december  the decrease in working capital reflects decreases in total current assets and total current liabilities of  and  respectively 
the decrease in total current assets reflects decreases in cash and cash equivalents of  a decrease in accounts receivable of  and a decrease in inventory of  partially offset by increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  the decrease in current liabilities primarily reflects a decrease in accounts payable of  and a decrease in our current portion of long term debt of  partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities of   of this amount relates to deferred revenue charges and an increase in accrued restructuring charges of  the decrease in cash of  reflects  of net cash used in operating activities   of net cash used in investing activities and  of net cash used in financing activities 
the cash used in operating activities  excluding non cash charges  is primarily attributable to the  net loss for the year ended december   a  increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  a  increase in other assets  and a  decrease in accounts payable partially offset by a  decrease in accounts receivable  a  decrease in inventory  a  increase in other current liabilities and a  increase in other liabilities 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily includes the recognition of increased premiums for prepaid property taxes and insurance  as well as increases in other service costs 
the increase in other current liabilities and other liabilities reflects  of deferred revenue charges which will be recognized over a three year period beginning in march the decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflects the level of sales during the year ended december  as well as the timing of collection of such sale 
the decrease in accounts payable as well as the decrease in inventory primarily reflect differences in the timing related to both the payments for and the acquisition of raw materials as well as for other services in connection with ongoing efforts related to our various product lines 
the cash used in investing activities is attributable to capital expenditures consisting of manufacturing dies and molds and  to a lesser extent  upgrades in our existing computer systems 
the net cash used in financing activities reflects the payment of the final installment payment to the former shareholders of lamar as well as payments to the debt we assumed in connection with the acquisition of lamar  partially offset by the exercises of employee stock options 
we believe that it will be necessary to raise additional working capital to support operations 
in december  april  august and june  andrea raised working capital through the issuance of convertible subordinated debentures 
in june  andrea raised million through the issuance and sale of series b preferred stock 
in october  andrea raised million through the issuance and sale of series c preferred stock 
furthermore  in accordance with eitf issue  application of eitf issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  andrea recorded a one time non cash charge of  to accumulated deficit 
this pronouncement values the economic benefit of the contingent beneficial conversion feature that the holders of the series c preferred stock received when the conversion price of the series c preferred stock was reset from to in july this charge represents the maximum charge under this standard and  accordingly  there will be no additional charges to equity at later reset dates 
andrea has incurred significant losses in each of the last three fiscal years 
in the year ended december   andrea incurred losses from operations  excluding the impact of restructuring charges  of million  and used million in cash in its operating activities 
management expects that operating losses and negative cash flows will continue at least through fiscal as andrea continues to market its andrea anti noise products  aircraft communication products and andrea dsp microphone and software technologies 
nothwithstanding  in december and march  we entered into two agreements with analog devices  inc whereby analog devices is obligated to pay us a total of million in license fees during calendar through the date of this form k  and in accordance with our agreements  we have received million of these license fees 
if andrea fails to develop revenues from sales of its products to generate adequate funding from operations or fails to obtain additional financing through capital or funding  it will be required to either further reduce its operating expenses and or operations or may result it relinquishing its products  technologies or markets 
such financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we cannot assure that demand will continue for any of our products  including future products related to our andrea digital signal processing microphone and software technologies  or  that if such demand does exist  that we will be able to obtain the necessary working capital to increase production and marketing resources to meet such demand on favorable terms  or at all 
recently issued accounting pronouncements goodwill and other intangible assets in july  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently  if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
andrea has adopted this standard effective january   and  accordingly  those intangible assets that will continue to be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized 
other intangible assets  which do not have indefinite lives such as core technology note  will continue to be amortized 
andrea has made a preliminary assessment of its intangible assets to identify goodwill separately from other identifiable intangibles 
no adjustment was deemed necessary  although the intangible asset workforce in place will be reclassified as goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
in accordance with the sfas no 
 intangible assets  including purchased goodwill  will be evaluated periodically for impairment 
based upon the results of andrea s transitional impairment testing  there will be no material impact on the combined financial results related to andrea s intangible assets or purchased goodwill 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  relating to the assets that will no longer be amortized  was approximately  for the year ended december  long lived assets in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and accounting principles board opinion no 
reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the statement retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for recognition and measurement of impairment  but amends the accounting and reporting standards for segments of a business to be disposed of 
the provisions of this statement are required to be adopted no later than fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption encouraged 
andrea is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
 which andrea expects will not be material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal source of financing activities is the issuance of convertible debt with financial institutions 
we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through any amounts payable in stock  or cash by us under convertible securities 
a significant rise in interest rates could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose 
in addition  substantially all transactions by us are denominated in us dollars 
as such  we have shifted foreign currency exposure onto our foreign customers 
as a result  if exchange rates move against foreign customers  we could experience difficulty collecting unsecured accounts receivable  the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders 
the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations
