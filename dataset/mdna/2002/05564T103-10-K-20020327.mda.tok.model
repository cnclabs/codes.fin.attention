results of operations compared to revenues total revenue in was million  an increase of compared to apartment rental income accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in apartment rental income in was million  an increase of  or million  compared to this increase is attributable to million rental income at oak hollow apartments phase  which we acquired in december on a same units basis for the  units that we owned throughout all of both years  apartment rental income declined by in compared to on a same units basis  average economic occupancy was in compared to in  and average monthly revenue per occupied apartment was compared to in average economic occupancy for all apartments including oak hollow apartments phase  which we acquired in december was in compared to in  and average monthly revenue per occupied apartment was in compared to in with the exception of virginia beach  virginia  our apartment markets weakened during  and remain weak 
slight increases in revenue per occupied apartment were insufficient to overcome the impact of declines in occupancy 
while we remain confident in the long term prospects for our markets and our properties  we do not foresee any significant improvement in apartment operations over the near term 
the weakness in the markets is largely the result of overbuilding 
while construction activity has slowed recently  it will take some time for the excess supply of new apartments to be absorbed 
until then  the competition for residents will remain intense 
declining interest rates and  more recently  a general economic slowdown have also had an impact on apartment occupancy and rental rates 
for those with jobs  lower interest rates have made single family home ownership far more affordable 
on the other hand  the general economic slowdown has led to significant job losses 
while the underlying explanation as to why declining interest rates or a general economic slowdown impact apartment operations is quite different  both have the effect of reducing the pool of potential apartment residents  which  in turn  puts negative pressure on occupancy and rental rates 
restaurant rental income in was million  a decrease of compared to restaurant rental income accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in the decrease in restaurant rental income is due to the sales of one restaurant property in april and one restaurant property in june through  we have sold five of the original restaurants to boddie noell enterprises  inc  the lessee  under the non economic clause of an agreement that allows enterprises to close up to seven restaurants and buy them back for no less than net carrying value 
restaurant rental income during both and was the minimum rent specified in the lease agreement 
under our master lease with enterprises  restaurant rental income payments are the greater of specified minimum rent or of food sales 
minimum rent is currently set at  per month  and is reduced by approximately  per month  or  per year  for each restaurant that is sold 
same store sales for the restaurants that were open through all of both years declined by in compared to sales at these restaurants would have to increase by approximately before we would receive rent exceeding the minimum rent 
we do not expect restaurant rental income to exceed the minimum in as we discussed in the notes to our financial statements  effective january   we acquired the minority interest in bnp management  inc the management company 
for  we included the revenues from management services for three third party owned properties in our consolidated revenue amounts 
in  we reported net equity income related to activities of the management company 
this change in basis of presentation has not had a significant impact on our financial position  overall operating results or cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we expanded our third party management activities by entering into contracts to manage multi family communities 
on january   we added a contract to manage one additional community 
we expect that third party management contracts will generate approximately million in management fee income in management fee income totaled  in  including  generated from new contracts during the fourth quarter 
if the former management company activities had been reflected on a consolidated basis in our financial statements  equity income as reported would have been replaced with management fee income of approximately  in interest and other income includes approximately  non routine income in recurring interest and other income was generally comparable to amounts 
the non routine income items in are as follows o  shared appreciation related to our participating loan agreement with the villages of chapel hill limited partnership  discussed below  o  fee income for arranging refinancing at the villages of chapel hill and the villages of chapel hill phase  two managed apartment properties  and o  miscellaneous income  for the refund of and state franchise taxes 
effective july   we modified our participating loan agreement with the villages of chapel hill limited partnership 
this modification established a  fixed portion of our participation in the increase in value of the property and extended the period for our participation in increased rental revenue and increase in value of the property to the earlier of july or sale or refinance of the property 
we received an initial payment of  of the fixed portion in july  which we reflected in the financial statements as other income 
required payment of the fixed portion is subject to cash flow from the villages property  calculated every six months  as defined in the agreement 
at december   payment of  was currently due and was received in january interest on the outstanding fixed portion accrues at the greater of a prime rate or  payable monthly 
because the timing of payment of the remaining fixed portion is subject to cash flow and therefore uncertain  we have provided a reserve for collection of this receivable  and we will recognize revenue as it is realized 
expenses total expenses  including non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  in were million  an increase of compared to apartment operations expense was million in  an increase of  or million  compared to this increase is attributable to the addition of oak hollow apartments phase  in  along with the impact of higher costs for on site compensation  property taxes and insurance  and property administration and turnover costs 
apartment operations expense includes only direct costs of on site operations 
apartment operations expense in represented of related apartment rental income  compared to in during the second half of  we experienced a significant increase in redecoration and turnover expense at our apartment communities 
intense competition due to overbuilding  home purchases  and job losses due to the current economic slowdown have all contributed to higher turnover of residents 
as a result  we have spent more in turnover and redecoration  as well as leasing and promotion expense  in an effort to attract and retain residents 
we expect that these costs will remain at relatively high levels for as long as current market conditions persist 
we incur no operating expenses for restaurant properties  because the triple net lease arrangement requires the lessee to pay virtually all of the costs and expenses associated with the restaurant properties 
we are now able to identify and compare apartment administration expenses for and these costs include our property management activities as well as accounting and support activities directly related to apartment management 
prior to  these costs were included in our line item for administrative expenses that included both apartment and corporate administrative costs  and we have reclassified these amounts in the and financial statements to conform to the presentation 
in addition  we now include the expenses of our third party management activities in these consolidated expense amounts 
apartment administration expense totaled million in  including approximately  in costs directly related to servicing third party management contracts acquired during the fourth quarter of the year 
if the activities of the management company had been reflected on a consolidated basis in our financial statements  apartment administration expense would have been approximately  in the increase in apartment administration expense in is attributable to the impact of the increase in the number of units under management  as well as increased property management supervisory compensation and travel expenditures 
corporate administration expense totaled million in if the activities of the management company had been reflected on a consolidated basis in our financial statements  corporate administration expense would have been approximately million in the increase in corporate administration expense in is attributable to increased executive and corporate office staff compensation 
depreciation expense totaled million in  an increase of  or  compared to this increase is attributable to the addition of oak hollow apartments phase  in along with the impact of additions and replacements at other apartment communities 
we have generally assigned shorter lives to these specifically identifiable assets than the composite lives initially assigned at acquisitions 
amortization expense was essentially the same in and interest expense totaled million in  a decline of compared to this decline is primarily attributable to the decline in interest rates during overall  weighted average interest rates were in  compared to in in conjunction with a refinance of long term debt in september  we wrote off unamortized loan costs of  we have reflected this write off  net of minority interests share  with a charge of  as an extraordinary item in the financial statements 
in late december  we issued  shares of series b cumulative convertible preferred stock 
because preferred shareholders have priority over common shareholders for receipt of dividends  we deduct the amount of net income that has been or will be paid to preferred shareholders in calculating net income available to common shareholders 
the cumulative preferred dividend  for four days in the fourth quarter of  totals  this amount will increase in future periods  the dividend on the series b shares is per share per year 
net income income available to common shareholders in was million  a decrease of compared to operating partnership earnings before non cash charges for depreciation  amortization  and extraordinary item totaled million  a increase compared to the minority interest in operating partnership earnings in was  a increase compared to income available to common shareholders was per share in compared to in the decline in per share amounts resulted from a number of factors  including an increase in non cash charges for depreciation expense and a non cash extraordinary charge for write off of loan costs 
compared to revenues total revenue in was million  an increase of compared to apartment rental income accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in apartment rental income in was million  an increase of compared to this increase reflects improvements in both occupancy and average rental rates in average economic occupancy for all apartments was in compared to in average monthly revenue per occupied unit for all apartments was in compared to in these comparisons reflect the results for all  apartments in operation through the entire months of both and our acquisition of oak hollow apartments phase took place in late december apartment rental income was consistent with our expectations in our apartment communities continued to show improved occupancy and rental rates despite the fact that we operate in some of the most competitive apartment markets in the united states 
with the exception of virginia beach  virginia  significant new apartment construction over the past few years has resulted in an oversupply of apartments in our markets 
restaurant rental income in was million  a decrease of compared to restaurant rental income accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in the decrease in restaurant rental income was due to the sales of three restaurant properties in june and one restaurant property in june the four restaurants were sold to boddie noell enterprises  the lessee  under the non economic clause of an agreement that allows the lessee to close up to seven restaurants and buy them back for no less than net carrying value 
under the lease  restaurant rental payments are the greater of a specified minimum rent or of food sales 
prior to the sales of the four restaurants  the minimum rent was  per year 
the minimum rent is reduced by approximately  per year for each restaurant that is sold 
restaurant rental income in both and was the minimum rent specified in the lease agreement 
same store sales for our restaurants that were open through the entire months of both and declined by in compared to interest and other income decreased by to  in as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a  reduction in interest income due to repayment in february of  in principal on a note receivable from a joint venture partnership 
our interest in the net income of the management company was  in compared to  in expenses total expenses  including non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  in were million  an increase of compared to we have reclassified amounts for apartment operations  apartment administration  and corporate administration expenses to conform to our presentation 
apartment operations expense was million in  an increase of compared to apartment operations expense represented of related apartment rental income  compared to in this increase was primarily attributable to higher costs for compensation of on site staff  taxes  and property insurance 
apartment administration expense was  in  a decline of compared to corporate administration expense was million in  an increase of compared to these costs were in line with management s expectations 
we incur no operating expenses for restaurant properties  because the restaurant properties triple net lease arrangement requires the lessee to pay virtually all of the costs and expenses associated with the restaurant properties 
during  we entered into negotiations for a private equity transaction 
the company terminated those negotiations during the fourth quarter of  and we recorded a charge of  for those costs 
because this was a significant and non recurring charge  we have reported this charge as a separate line item in our statement of operations 
depreciation and amortization totaled million in  an increase of compared to these increases reflect the impact of additions and replacements at apartment communities 
interest expense was million in  an increase of compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the approximate increase in variable interest rates during the first half of overall  weighted average interest rates were in compared to in net income income available to common shareholders in was million  a decrease of compared to operating partnership earnings before depreciation and amortization in were million  a decrease of  while non cash charges for depreciation and amortization totaled million  an increase of  compared to the minority interest in operating partnership earnings in was  a decrease of compared to income available to common shareholders was per share in compared to in the decline in per share amounts was primarily due to increases in interest expense  decrease in restaurant rental income  a significant non recurring charge for a terminated equity transaction  and increases in non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
funds from operations funds from operations and funds available for distribution are defined in footnote on pages and we calculated funds from operations as follows all amounts in thousands income before minority interest and extraordinary item    cumulative preferred dividend depreciation    amortization of management intangible funds from operations operating partnership    a reconciliation of funds from operations to funds available for distribution follows all amounts in thousands funds from operations operating partnership    amortization of loan costs recurring capital expenditures    funds available for distribution    a further reconciliation of funds from operations of the operating partnership to basic funds from operations available to common shareholders follows all amounts in thousands funds from operations operating partnership    minority interest in funds from operations    basic funds from operations available to common shareholders    other information about our historical cash flows follows all amounts in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities   financing activities    dividends and distributions paid to common shareholders    minority unitholders in operating partnership    scheduled debt principal payments non recurring capital expenditures acquisition improvements and replacements apartment property additions and betterments weighted average common shares outstanding    weighted average operating partnership minority units outstanding    funds from operations in before deduction for minority interest totaled million  an increase of compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to non routine revenue received in  while operating results for the two years were essentially flat 
funds from operations in before deduction for minority interest declined compared to million in the modest increase in contribution from apartment operations in was not adequate to offset the increase in interest expense  the decrease in restaurant rental income  or the significant non recurring costs of a terminated equity transaction 
funds available for distribution totaled million in  an increase of compared to funds available for distribution totaled million in  a decline of compared to million in the variance in comparison of funds available for distribution and funds from operations reflects the impact of recurring capital expenditures for major capital maintenance costs at our older communities 
recurring capital expenditures averaged per apartment unit in  per apartment unit in  and per unit in capital resources and liquidity capital resources we intend to pursue our growth strategy through the utilization of our flexible capital structure 
this may include the issuance of operating partnership units  common stock and or preferred stock  additional debt  and joint venture investments 
we may use our lines of credit or fixed rate  long term debt to acquire apartment communities 
long term debt as of december   all of our properties were encumbered by or served as collateral for debt 
as of december   total long term debt was million  including million of notes payable at fixed interest rates ranging from to  and million at variable rates indexed on day libor rates 
the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding at december   was  compared to at december  this reduction is primarily due to declines in variable rates during at our current level of variable rate debt  a fluctuation in variable interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately in november  we modified our previously established revolving lines of credit with a bank for lines secured by latitudes apartments and our restaurant properties 
these line of credit arrangements are now as follows o million  secured by a deed of trust and assignment of rents of latitudes apartments  due november interest only payments on the outstanding balance are due monthly at a variable interest rate of day libor plus 
at december   the outstanding balance on this line was million 
of this line  million is reserved  subject to available draws against a variable rate note payable  for acquisition improvements at oak hollow apartments phase  and approximately million is available under this revolving line of credit 
o million  secured by a deed of trust and assignment of rents of restaurant properties  due january interest only payments on the outstanding balance are due monthly at a variable interest rate of day libor plus 
the available line of credit declines to million effective january at december   the outstanding balance on this line was million 
in september  we issued a million note payable  secured by a deed of trust and assignment of rents of paces commons apartments 
the note provides for interest at  payable in monthly installments  with maturity in october we applied approximately million of these proceeds to retire an existing deed of trust note for the same property  and million of proceeds to reduce our latitudes line of credit 
paces commons was our first apartment community  acquired in june for an initial acquisition cost of million 
in february  we completed refinancing for oakbrook apartments  with a million note payable with interest at and maturity in february this deed of trust note replaced an existing note with a balance of million  with the balance of proceeds applied to reduce our latitudes line of credit 
oakbrook was our second apartment community  acquired in june for an initial acquisition cost of million 
in replacing the financing on paces commons and oakbrook apartments  we were able to substantially increase loan amounts based on the lender s estimates of the appreciated fair market values of the properties 
we applied excess proceeds of these fixed rate loans to reduce outstanding balances on our variable rate lines of credit 
we utilized long term debt  along with draws on our lines of credit  to finance acquisitions of apartment communities in and as follows o in december  we acquired oak hollow apartments phase for a total cost of approximately million 
we financed this acquisition with a million initial draw on an million variable rate loan secured by a deed of trust on the community and million draws on our lines of credit 
we have subsequently drawn approximately  against this loan  and approximately million remains available to fund renovations at this community 
o in january  we acquired chason ridge apartments for a total cost of approximately million 
we financed this acquisition by assuming long term debt of million and million draws on our lines of credit 
we have also utilized our lines of credit to repurchase and retire approximately  shares of our common stock in and  to retire a million note payable to an affiliate in  and to fund capital improvements at our apartment communities 
a summary of scheduled principal payments on long term debt is included in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the notes to the financial statements in this annual report 
significant scheduled balloon payments include maturities of o our line of credit secured by deeds of trust and assignment of rents of restaurants  due january million outstanding at december   o our line of credit secured by a deed of trust and assignment of rents of latitudes apartments  due november up to million  million outstanding at december   o our deed of trust loan for oak hollow apartments phase  due december up to million for acquisition and renovation construction  million outstanding at december   and o our deed of trust loan for harris hill apartments  due june million outstanding at december  
capital stock and operating partnership units at december   we had approximately million common shares and approximately  preferred shares outstanding 
in addition  there were approximately million operating partnership units  or approximately  held by minority interest owners 
in december  our board of directors authorized the issuance of up to  shares of series b cumulative convertible preferred stock  and we issued  shares to a single investor for proceeds of million 
we utilized these proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance on our latitudes line of credit 
under the terms of the investment agreement for this placement  we must issue the remaining  shares for an additional million by december  and the offering may be expanded to million on the same terms and conditions through december the preferred shares have a purchase price and liquidation preference of per share  an initial dividend yield of through december  and may be converted to our common stock on a one for one basis after three years 
during through  we issued approximately  shares of our common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
we generally applied these proceeds to capital expenditures at apartment communities 
all of the operating partnership units held by minority interest owners were issued in through in conjunction with acquisitions of apartment communities 
holders of operating partnership units generally are able to redeem their units for cash or  at our option  for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis after one year from issuance 
cash flows and liquidity net cash flows from operating activities were million in  and million in and investing and financing activities focused primarily on apartment acquisitions and capital expenditures at apartment communities  along with payments of dividends and distributions 
we paid dividends of per share per quarter in each quarter of   and our payout ratio the ratio of dividends plus distributions paid to operating partnership funds from operations was in  in  and in we intend to pay dividends quarterly  expect that these dividends will substantially exceed the distribution requirement for reits  and anticipate that all dividends will be paid from current funds from operations 
we continue to produce sufficient cash flow to fund our regular dividend 
however  any number of unforeseen events  or a combination of such events for example  a substantial decline in apartment operations  a substantial increase in short term interest rates  or the sale of the restaurant properties or other assets  might necessitate a reduction in the current dividend 
we generally expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and utilization of credit facilities 
we believe that net cash provided by operations is  and will continue to be  adequate to meet the reit operating requirements in both the short and the long term 
we anticipate funding our future acquisition activities primarily by using short term credit facilities as an interim measure  to be replaced by funds from equity offerings  long term debt  or joint venture investments 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and repayment of short term financing of possible property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities 
we believe we have sufficient resources to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
we received approximately of our revenue in  compared to in and in  from rent received from boddie noell enterprises for the use of our restaurant properties 
in addition  enterprises is responsible for all of the costs associated with the maintenance and operations of these properties 
over time  we expect that restaurant rental income will continue to represent a decreasing percentage of our total revenue 
under our current line of credit agreement  enterprises has the right to purchase  under specified terms  up to two additional restaurants deemed non economic  for no less than net carrying value 
the annual minimum rent would be reduced by approximately  for each restaurant sold 
we would receive sale proceeds of the greater of net carrying value or fair value 
as of december   the average net book value of the restaurant properties was approximately  as in the past  we would most likely apply sale proceeds to reduce outstanding debt on our line of credit 
enterprises is a privately owned company with total assets exceeding million and net equity exceeding million 
its principal line of business is the operation of approximately hardee s restaurants 
in addition to its hardee s operations  enterprises is the owner of texas steakhouse and saloon  a casual dining concept with restaurants 
enterprises also conducts extensive real estate investment and development activities through bne land and development 
these activities involve a full range of property types  including land  commercial  retail  office  apartment and single family properties 
we have had extensive discussions with management of enterprises and have reviewed their financial statements  cash flow analysis  restaurant contribution analysis  sales trend analysis and projections 
we believe that enterprises will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its obligations under the master lease as well as its general corporate operating needs 
capital expenditures and depreciation for acquired apartment properties  we compute depreciation using the straight line method over composite estimated useful lives of the related assets  generally years for buildings  years for land improvements  years for fixtures and equipment  and five years for floor coverings 
we generally complete and capitalize acquisition improvements expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired  and which are intended to position the property consistent with our physical standards within one to two years of acquisition 
we capitalize non recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements 
in addition  we generally capitalize recurring capital expenditures for exterior painting  roofing  and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of existing assets 
for financial reporting purposes  we depreciate these additions and replacements on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of years 
we capitalize all floor covering  appliance  and hvac replacements  and depreciate them using a straight line  group method over estimated useful lives of years 
we expense ordinary repairs and maintenance costs at apartment communities 
during  we capitalized additions and replacements as follows all amounts in thousands recurring capital expenditures  acquisition improvements non recurring additions and betterments repairs and maintenance at our apartment communities totaled approximately million  including million in compensation of service staff and million in payments for materials and contracted services 
costs of repairs  maintenance  and capital replacements and improvements at restaurant properties are borne by the lessee 
inflation we do not believe that inflation poses a material risk to the company 
the leases at our apartment properties are short term in nature 
none are longer than two years 
the restaurant properties are leased on a triple net basis  which places the risk of rising operating and maintenance costs on the lessee 
environmental matters phase i environmental studies performed on the apartment communities when we acquired each of them did not identify any problems that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
environmental transaction screens for each of the restaurant properties in did not indicate existence of any environmental problems that warranted further investigation 
enterprises has indemnified us under the master lease for environmental problems associated with the restaurant properties 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of we expect that application of the nonamortization provisions of the statements will result in an increase in net income of approximately  per year 
during  we will perform the first of the required impairments tests of the intangible related to acquisition of management operations  as of january  we do not believe that the effect of these tests will have a significant impact on the earnings and financial position of the company 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for years beginning after december  this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
we expect to adopt statement no 
as of january   and we do not expect this adoption to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations
