the company utilizes a value at risk var model and an earnings at risk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in its interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments assuming adverse market conditions occur  given a confidence level 
the models utilize a variance covariance modeling technique 
historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates from the preceding year are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates

overall  subject to global economic conditions  the company does not expect the market conditions to be materially different from those experienced in and the company expects its positive momentum to continue 
historically  the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries  and therefore the company constantly evaluates projects that will focus operations on opportunities for enhanced growth potential 
over the long term  colgate s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names  its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets  and its strong capital base all position the company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to continue to increase profitability and shareholder value
