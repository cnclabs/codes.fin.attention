ebitda is not intended to indicate that cash flow is sufficient to fund all of the company s cash needs or represent cash flow from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in addition  ebitda should not be used as a tool for comparison as the computation may not be similar for all companies 
interest expense decreased  or from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the decrease is due to decreased interest rates on the company s senior credit facility and a decrease in interest associated with subordinated notes due to repayments 
the decreases were offset by an increase in the company s senior subordinated debt which increased from to in october income tax expense totaled  for fiscal  which reflects a effective tax rate 
the reduction in the tax rate from fiscal is principally caused by the implementation of fas  as the company is no longer amortizing non deductible goodwill

interest expense increased by  or for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense was a result of increased borrowings under the company s senior debt facility and an increase in interest rates on the company s floating rate senior debt 
the provision for income taxes of  for fiscal was in excess of amounts computed by applying statutory federal income tax rates to income before income taxes due primarily to non deductible goodwill incurred with acquisitions for stock and state income taxes 
for acquisitions of stock of a company  purchase accounting applies for accounting purposes  but  for tax purposes  the company inherits the historic basis of the purchased company in its assets  without any goodwill 
change in revenue recognition in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance related to revenue recognition

 accounting changes 
previously  the majority of registration fees were deferred when received and recorded in september to coincide with fall enrollment 
registration fees for students enrolled during the school year were recorded when received 
under the accounting method adopted retroactive to july   the company recognizes school registration fees over the typical school year of august to june 
summer camp registration fees are now recognized during months june  july and august 
the cumulative effect of the change on prior years resulted in a charge to income net of taxes of  that was recognized during sab modifies the recognition of fee income but has no impact on cash flow or the operations of the company 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal cash flows total cash and cash equivalents increased  from  at june  to  at june  the net increase was primarily related to cash provided from operations totaling  repayments on notes receivable of  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of  and an increase in borrowings under the senior credit facility of  these sources of cash were offset by  in capital expenditures  a decrease in cash overdraft liability of  and repayments of subordinated debt of  the working capital deficit decreased  from  at june  to  at june  the decrease is primarily the result of a decrease of  in cash overdraft liability and a decrease of  in current maturities of long term debt 
this decrease was offset by an increase in unearned income totaling  and a decrease of  in notes receivable 
the increase in unearned income is related to the prepayment of annual and semi annual tuition by parents and by registration fees collected at the beginning of the school year 
the company anticipates that its existing available principal credit facilities  cash generated from operations and continued support of site developers to build and lease schools will be sufficient to satisfy working capital needs  capital expenditures and renovations and the building of new schools during fiscal  but acquisitions will be limited in number 
in addition  the company is committed to a plan and is actively marketing approximately  in real estate for a potential sale leaseback transaction 
long term obligations and commitments in may  the company entered into its current amended and restated loan and security agreement  which increased the company s borrowing capacity to  three separate facilities were established under the amended and restated loan and security agreement  working capital credit facility   acquisition credit facility and  term loan 
the term loan facility will mature on april  and provides for  annual interim amortization with the balance paid at maturity 
under the acquisition credit facility  no principal payments are required until april at that time  the outstanding principal under the acquisition credit facility will be converted into a term loan that will require principal payments in quarterly installments 
the working capital credit facility is scheduled to terminate on april  in addition  the credit facilities provide that nlci must meet or exceed defined interest coverage ratios and must not exceed leverage ratios 
at june   the company was not in compliance with two credit facility financial covenant ratios 
the company  however  received a waiver for the breach of the interest coverage ratio and adjusted leverage ratio at june  in addition  the breached ratios were amended and restated to lower ratio requirements for fiscal the company s interest coverage ratio increased from a ratio of ebitda of times interest expense or higher to times interest expense or higher at june  the company s ratio was times ebitda at june  the company s adjusted leverage ratio decreased from times ebitda or plus rent expenses to times ebitda plus rent expense at june  the company s ratio was times ebitda plus rent expense at june  the company is in compliance with all other bank covenant requirements

there was  outstanding under the working capital credit facility   was outstanding under the acquisition credit facility   was outstanding under the term loan and  in outstanding letters of credit 
in addition  the company has  outstanding under subordinated debt agreements as well as significant commitments under operating lease agreements 
the following is a summary of these obligations dollars in thousands contractual obligations less than year and total year years after long term obligations     interest rate swap operating leases     total     the company announced on august  that it had entered into a merger agreement with socrates under which the company would be the surviving corporation 
the company has incurred  and will continue to incur  substantial fees for services in connection with this transaction that heretofore have been capitalized 
if the transaction is consummated  these fees will be allocated to the equity and debt financing of the transaction and thereafter treated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in the event the transaction is not consummated  these fees will be expensed at that time 
the resulting write off may be material and may be sufficiently large that the company will find itself out of compliance with the covenants associated with its existing senior debt 
we cannot determine at this time whether any such write off would be material or would cause the company to be in default under the credit facility with its senior lender 
the company also has significant commitments with certain of its executives that would be triggered upon a change in control and certain termination events 
capital expenditures the company is continuously maintaining and  where necessary  upgrading the property and equipment of each school

fasb is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment 
actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are considered critical to the preparation of the company s financial statements due to the estimation processes and business judgment involved in their application 
revenue recognition tuition revenues  net of discounts and other revenues are recognized as services are performed 
any tuition payments received in advance of the time period for which service is to be performed is recorded as unearned revenue 
charter school management fees are recognized based on a contractual relationship with the charter school and do not include any tuition revenue received by the charter school 
certain fees may be received in advance of services being rendered  in which case the fee revenue is deferred and recognized over the appropriate period of service 
the company s net revenues meet the criteria of sab no 
 including the existence of an arrangement  the rendering of services  a determinable fee and probable collection 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable are comprised primarily of tuition due from governmental agencies and parents 
accounts receivable are presented at estimated net realizable value 
the company uses estimates in determining the collectibility of its accounts receivable and must rely on its evaluation of historical trends  governmental funding processes  specific customer issues and current economic trends to arrive at appropriate reserves 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of bad debt expense if actual experience differs significantly from management estimates 
the company provides its services to the parents and guardians of the children attending the schools 
the company does not extend credit for an extended period of time  nor does it require collateral 
exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each person s financial condition 
the company also has investments in other entities 
the collectibility of such investments is dependent upon the financial performance of these entities 
the company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses 
long lived and intangible assets under the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  the company assesses the potential impairment of property and equipment and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an asset s value is impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
such cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income and historical trends  as well as the effects of demand and competition 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset 
such estimates require the use of judgment and numerous subjective assumptions  which  if actual experience varies  could result in material differences in the requirements for impairment charges 
goodwill the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective july  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
as a result  the company ceased amortization of goodwill  the effect of which was a reduction of  of amortization expense for the year ended june  the net carrying value of goodwill was  as of july  the company s adoption date of sfas 
the company completed the first step impairment test as required under sfas at december  and determined that the recognition of an impairment loss was not necessary 
the fair value of the company s ten reporting units was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
in estimating the present value the company used assumptions based on the characteristics of the reporting unit including discount rates ranging from to 
for two of the reporting units fair value approximated their carrying value while for the remaining eight reporting units fair value exceeded carrying value 
for the two reporting units where fair value approximated carrying value  goodwill allocated to these reporting units totaled  and  accordingly  the company updated its analysis at june  and concluded that no impairment was required for these two reporting units 
goodwill will be assessed for impairment at least annually or upon an adverse change in operations 
the annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
will require judgments and estimates and could require us to write down the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
long term note receivable the company has a  note receivable pursuant to a credit agreement with total education solutions tes due may  of which  is convertible into ownership of tes 
tes  established in  provides special education services to charter schools and public schools which  because of lack of internal capabilities or other reasons  wish to out source their provision of special education programs which  under federal law  they are required to provide to select students 
the proceeds received by tes have been used for the expansion of its product throughout california and plans to enter other states 
although tes s revenues have grown since the origination of the credit agreement  tes has also incurred losses as a result of building the infrastructure to service other regions 
as part of our evaluation of the carrying value of tes  we consider a number of positive and negative factors affecting tes including 
operating results and outlook for tes  
expected future cash flows  
current conditions and trends in the industry  
other industry comparables  and 
our plans and ability to continue to hold this investment 
in evaluating the investment in tes  a discounted cash flow analyses was prepared for tes based on a recent financing discussion memorandum 
the cash flow analyses indicated that the investment in tes has a value greater than our current carrying value 
in addition  we reviewed other objective evidence including recent comparable transactions similar to tes  industry publications supporting the market and growth rates and tes s ongoing discussions with third parties regarding additional financing 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method  in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes

a valuation allowance is recorded based on the uncertainty regarding the ultimate realizability of deferred tax assets
