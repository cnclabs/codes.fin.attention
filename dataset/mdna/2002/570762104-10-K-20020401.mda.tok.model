item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to factors that have affected our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december   and certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in reference should also be made to our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the selected financial data included in this form k 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gathering  processing and marketing revenue 
gathering  processing and marketing revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
revenue was lower in than in primarily due to a decrease in the average appalachian ngl sales price  which accounted for approximately million of the overall decrease 
the appalachian average ngl sales price is based on both sales out of our siloam fractionator as well as our appalachian terminal outlets 
the appalachian average ngl sales price was per gallon for the year ended december   compared to per gallon for the year ended december   a decrease of per gallon  or 
a decrease in gas marketing revenues  which accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
gas marketing revenues declined in as natural gas prices and volumes sold decreased from above average levels that existed in exploration and production revenue 
exploration and production revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
revenue was higher in than in primarily due to our acquisition of two canadian natural gas production companies during august  accounting for million of the increase 
natural gas sales prices increased  accounting for million of the increase 
for our combined rocky mountain and michigan production  our average sales price was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in  an increase of per mcfe  or 
our combined natural gas production and sales from our rocky mountain and michigan properties increased during  accounting for million of the increase 
the increase in our production was a direct result of our ongoing capital program for our united states properties 
cost of sales 
cost of sales were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
cost of sales were lower in primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of our appalachian replacement natural gas  which accounted for million of the overall decrease 
the average cost of our appalachian feedstock was equivalent to per ngl gallon for the year ended december   compared to per gallon for the year ended december   an decrease of per gallon  or 
a decrease in gas marketing cost of sales  which accounted for million of the overall decrease 
gas marketing cost of sales decreased principally due to a decrease in natural gas costs and volumes sold in operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in operating expenses during is principally attributable to our growing exploration and production business segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
depreciation and depletion 
depreciation and depletion were million for the year ended december   compared to million  for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was principally caused by a several appalachian expansion projects which commenced operations in and  and b the depletion of reserves through increased production from our canadian acquisition and our capital programs in canada  the rocky mountains and michigan 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
despite a significant increase in debt during due to our canadian acquisition  interest expense decreased due to decreasing interest rates throughout gain on sale of non operating assets 
we sold a non operating asset for a million gain in no significant non operating assets were sold in provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
provision for income taxes decreased principally due to lower income before income taxes in net income 
net income for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
net income decreased principally as a result of our average appalachian processing margin returning to near historically average levels in from above average levels in year ended december   compared to year ended december  gathering  processing and marketing revenue 
gathering  processing and marketing revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was principally attributable to an increase in our appalachian ngl product sales volumes  which accounted for approximately million of the overall increase 
appalachian sales volumes include volumes sold out of our siloam fractionator as well as our terminals 
the siloam fractionation facility s ngl sales volumes were a record million gallons for the year ended december   compared to million gallons for the year ended december   an increase of million gallons  or 
the increased volumes in were due to increased gas production behind our facilities and the natural gas processing plant and fractionation facility expansions in the appalachia area 
in particular  the maytown gas processing facility commenced operations during  providing a significant  new fee based revenue stream 
an increase in our appalachian average ngl sales price  which accounted for approximately million of the overall increase 
the appalachian average ngl sales price was per gallon for the year ended december   compared to per gallon for the year ended december   an increase of per gallon  or 
an increase in gas marketing revenue  which accounted for million of the overall increase 
gas marketing revenue was up due to above average natural gas prices and larger volumes sold in a decrease in michigan pipeline throughput and ngl sales volumes were offset by an increase in the michigan average ngl sales price 
exploration and production revenue 
exploration and production revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
revenue was higher in than in primarily due to a increase in the volume of natural gas produced and sold 
production increased because of our capital program 
cost of sales 
cost of sales were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our siloam fractionation facility s ngl sales volumes  which accounted for approximately million of the overall increase 
an increase in our average appalachian replacement natural gas cost  which accounted for approximately million of the overall increase 
the average cost of appalachian replacement natural gas was equivalent to per ngl gallon for the year ended december   compared to per gallon for the year ended december   an increase of per gallon  or 
an increase in gas marketing cost of sales  which accounted for approximately million of the overall increase 
gas marketing cost of sales increased due to above average natural gas prices in operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily attributable to increased operating costs associated with higher volumes processed through our new facilities in appalachia 
the recently constructed maytown and recently acquired boldman and cobb extraction facilities and related pipeline added million in expenses  and the expanded siloam fractionation plant added million in expenses 
higher natural gas costs and greater volumes in also increased fuel costs by million at the siloam fractionation facility in appalachia 
our appalachian expansion added million in regional expenses 
lower michigan pipeline throughput volumes decreased operating costs million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily in support of the new appalachian facilities and rent for office space  markwest hydrocarbon sold its corporate headquarters and leased back its office space commencing in february depreciation and depletion 
depreciation and depletion were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
depreciation expense increased as a result of the appalachian expansion during gain on sale of operating asset 
in  we sold an asset for a million gain 
in  no significant operating assets were sold 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was principally attributable to the amortization of deferred financing costs 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for year ended december   was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
provision for income taxes increased principally due to higher income before income taxes 
net income 
net income for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
record appalachian ngl production and related ngl sales volumes and above average ngl sales margins in were the primary reasons for the increase in net income 
the increased volumes were due to increased gas production behind our facilities and our gas processing and fractionation plant expansions 
critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
for further details on our accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
reserve estimates our estimates of gas and oil reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas and oil reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future gas and oil prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover gas costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas and oil attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our gas and oil properties and or the rate of depletion of the gas and oil properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we evaluate the long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value for the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than fair value 
for assets identified to be disposed of in the future  the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required 
until the assets are disposed of  an estimate of the fair value is recalculated when related events or circumstances change 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the volume of reserves behind the asset and future ngl product and natural gas prices 
the amount of reserves and drilling activity are dependent in part on natural gas prices 
projections of reserves and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors 
any significant variance in any of our assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
for a more complete discussion of these factors  you should read forward looking information in items and included in this form k 
factors that affect projections of reserves and future commodity prices are the same factors that could impact our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
from time to time  our sources of funds are supplemented with proceeds from the sale of a non core asset  like the sale of our corporate office building in we may also use operating leases to finance support equipment 
we believe that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and fund our required capital expenditures 
cash generated from operations will depend on our operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the ngl and natural gas industries and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
for a more complete discussion of factors that will affect our cash flow from operations  you should read forward looking information in items and included in this form k 
as a result of our canadian acquisition and our capital program  our total debt increased from million at december   to million at december  our year end debt includes financing our seasonally high working capital requirements 
at the time of our canadian acquisition  we amended our credit facility  increasing our maximum borrowing amount to million 
on march   we amended our credit facility to reduce our maximum borrowing amount to million  based on our borrowing base and our working capital  the maximum available to be drawn on this date was approximately million 
our bank debt was approximately million at this date 
for further details regarding our amended credit facility  see financing facilities below 
on january   markwest energy partners  lp  a newly formed limited partnership created to own and operate most of our gathering  processing  transportation  storage  and fractionation assets in appalachia and michigan  filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission for an initial public offering 
on march   we filed an amendment to this form s we currently anticipate offering to the public approximately of the limited partner interests in the partnership 
we and certain of our affiliates will own the general partner of the partnership  as well as the remaining of the limited partner interests in the form of subordinated units 
the rights of the holders of subordinated units to receive distributions of cash from the partnership are subordinated to the rights of the public unitholders to receive such distributions 
in connection with the offering  we will enter into a number of contracts with the partnership pursuant to which we will pay it fees for providing us with gathering  processing  transportation  storage  and fractionation services 
we will retain the risks and benefits associated with our keep whole contracts in appalachia 
proceeds we receive from the offering will be used to reduce our outstanding debt 
we anticipate that the limited partnership will enter into a separate credit facility  the proceeds of which will be used to support the limited partnership s operations 
for financial reporting purposes  the results of operations of markwest energy partners  lp will be consolidated with our operating results 
the completion of the offering is subject to numerous conditions  including market conditions  and we can provide no assurance that it will be successfully completed 
a registration statement relating to the proposed offering has been filed with the securities and exchange commission but has not yet become effective 
the securities may not be sold  nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective 
the information contained in this form k with respect to this offering shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these securities 
absent the proceeds of the offering  or other sources of capital  our capital program may need to be reduced  depending on commodity price levels and our operating performance 
our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and concentrated in our e p business segment 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was almost the same amount as it was in favorable timing of cash flows from receivables and payables offset lower net income in net cash provided by operating activities was higher in relative to principally due to higher net income  a function of above average processing margins and record sales volumes in net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was much higher in due to our acquisition of two related e p companies in canada 
net of cash acquired  we paid million for the acquisition 
absent the canadian acquisition  capital expenditures over the last three years have principally been focused on our appalachian expansion and our various e p capital programs 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities were million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was much higher in principally due to borrowings used to purchase two canadian e p companies 
net cash used in financing activities was a result of  despite our extensive appalachian expansion  our ability to pay down our line of credit a modest amount because of strong cash flows from operations  which was a function of above average processing margins and record sales volumes in net cash provided by financing activities was a result of supplementing our appalachian expansion capital expenditures with net borrowings from our line of credit 
total contractual cash obligations a summary of our total contractual cash obligations as of december   giving effect to the march  credit agreement amendment  is as follows payment due by period type of obligation total obligation due in due in due in thereafter in thousands long term debt      operating leases      total contractual cash obligations    capital expenditures markwest s capital expenditures are summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands gathering  processing and marketing appalachia expansion and marketing assets    western michigan pipeline expansion canadian expansion  maintenance capital and other    gathering  processing and marketing    exploration and production canada  rocky mountains    western michigan   eastern michigan  exploration and production    total capital expenditures    capital requirements markwest forecasts a baseline capital budget of million for in our gpm segment  million is for the next phase of our canadian midstream infrastructure 
in our e p segment  million is for our canadian capital program  million is for our rocky mountain capital program and million for our michigan capital program 
another million is for company wide maintenance capital and other capital programs 
our baseline capital budget is principally discretionary and may change contingent upon a number of factors  including our results of operations and opportunities 
financing facilities in conjunction with our canadian acquisition  effective august   we amended our credit agreement with various financial institutions 
the amended agreement provided for a maximum borrowing amount of million 
subsequently  in december  based on our projected needs  we signed a letter agreement with our lead bank to reduce our maximum borrowing amount to million 
on march   we formalized our agreement and amended our credit agreement with various financial institutions to reflect this revision 
the million credit facility is comprised of million in revolving lines of credit million under a us facility and million under a canadian facility and a million term loan under the us facility 
the us facility matures august and the canadian facility matures october amortization is required as set out in the table above 
the amended credit facility includes a borrowing base  calculated semiannually  which is based principally on oil and gas properties and midstream assets initially determined to be million  plus a working capital borrowing base  calculated monthly  which is based on ngl product accounts receivable and inventory levels  to a maximum of million 
in the future  actual borrowing limits may be less than million  depending upon reserve reports on our properties  our working capital and our financial covenants 
the credit facility permits us to borrow money using either a base rate loan or a london interbank offered rate libor loan option  plus an applicable margin of between and  based on a certain debt to earnings ratio 
we pay fees of between and per annum on the unused commitment  based on our debt to earnings ratio 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets 
the loan agreement restricts certain activities  including incurrence of additional indebtedness  and requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios and other conditions 
at december   we had million outstanding under the credit facility bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion should be read in conjunction with notes and of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
we face market risk from commodity price variations 
we also incur credit risk  foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risk our primary risk management objective is to reduce volatility in our cash flows 
our hedging approach uses a statistical method that analyzes momentum and average pricing over time  and various fundamental data such as industry inventories  industry production  demand and weather 
hedging levels increase with capital commitments and debt levels and when above average margins exist 
we maintain a committee  including members of senior management  which oversees all hedging activity 
we utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  fixed for float price swaps and options on over the counter otc market 
new york mercantile exchange nymex traded futures are authorized for use  but only occasionally used 
swaps and futures allow us to protect our margins because corresponding losses or gains in the value of financial instruments are generally offset by gains or losses in the physical market 
we enter otc swaps with counterparties that are primarily other energy companies 
we conduct a standard credit review and have agreements with such parties that contain collateral requirements 
we use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
net credit exposure is marked to market daily 
we are subject to margin deposit requirements under otc agreements and nymex positions 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when a sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments  or b our otc counterparties fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas  ngl  or crude oil or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against decreases in such prices 
basis risk is the risk that an adverse change in the hedging market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the price of the physical commodity being hedged 
we hedge our basis risk for natural gas but are generally unable to do so for ngl products 
we have two different types of ngl product basis risk 
first  ngl product basis risk stems from the geographic price differentials between our sales locations and hedging contract delivery locations 
we cannot hedge our geographic basis risk because there are no readily available products or markets 
second  ngl product basis risk also results from the difference in relative price movements between crude oil and ngl products 
we may use crude oil  instead of ngl products  in our hedges because the ngl hedge products and markets are limited 
crude oil is highly correlated with certain ngl products 
as a result of our canadian e p acquisition  our expected natural gas production and sales volumes from our e p segment largely offset our keep whole contractual requirements for purchasing natural gas in our appalachian gpm segment  thereby reducing our risk caused by fluctuations in natural gas prices 
consequently  we are transitioning our hedging strategy to recognize this natural hedge between our e p production and our natural gas purchase requirements in our appalachian gpm business 
prior to our canadian e p acquisition  we hedged  in our gpm segment  our appalachian processing margin defined as revenues less cost of sales by simultaneously selling propane or crude oil while purchasing natural gas table i below 
in our e p segment  we historically hedged our natural gas sales table iii below 
as a result of our natural hedge  we are transitioning our hedging strategy such that we no longer specifically hedge our appalachian processing margin  nor our equivalent volume e p natural gas sales  rather we hedge our ngl sales only table ii below 
as of december   under our historical hedging practice  the hedged appalachian ngl product sales volumes and associated projected margin per ngl product gallon  were as follows table i hedged processing margin three months ended total year ended year ended march  june  september  december  december  december  ngl volumes hedged using crude oil ngl gallons     ngl processing margin gallon ngl volumes hedged using propane propane gallons    ngl processing margin gallon total ngl volumes hedged ngl gallons     ngl processing margin gallon under our new hedging strategy  we hedge our ngl product sales by selling forward propane or crude oil 
as of december   we hedged appalachian ngl product sales as follows table ii hedged sales price for ngl products three months ended total year ended year ended march  june  september  december  december  december  ngl volumes hedged using crude oil gallons  ngl sales price per gallon under tables i and ii  all projected margins or prices on open positions assume a the basis differentials between our sales location and the hedging contract s specified location  and b the correlation between crude oil and ngl products  are consistent with historical averages 
also within our gpm segment  for certain appalachian natural gas sales  as of december   we hedged  mmbtu and  mmbtu at per mmbtu for and  respectively 
in addition to these risk management tools  we utilize our ngl product storage facilities and contracts for third party storage to build product inventories during lower demand periods for resale during higher demand periods 
in our e p segment  under our historical hedging strategy we hedged our exposure to changes in market prices for our natural gas production by selling fixed for float swaps and utilizing costless collars 
historically  we hedged a significant portion of our natural gas production 
in light of our natural hedge  we are transitioning our hedging strategy to limit our hedges to e p natural gas production in excess of natural gas purchase requirements in our gpm segment 
as of december   we hedged natural gas volumes and prices as follows table iii hedged natural gas sales three months ended total year ended year ended march  june  september  december  december  december  december  mmbtu      mmbtu henry hub equivalent mmbtu reflects our hedged natural gas prices as if natural gas was sold at henry hub nymex 
we enter into speculative transactions on an infrequent basis 
specific approval by the board of directors is necessary prior to executing such transactions 
speculative transactions are marked to market at the end of each accounting period  and any gain or loss is recognized in income for that period 
there were no such speculative activities for the years ended december   and our hedging program reduces our annual sensitivity to changes in ngl product sales prices 
in our gpm segment  net income would have been lower by million and higher by million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  if we had not hedged 
these figures consider only hedges of appalachian processing margin and do not reflect other decisions made concerning when to buy natural gas or store ngl production for sale in later months 
in our e p segment  without hedging  net income would have been lower by million and higher by million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
looking ahead  as of february   under our historical hedging practice  we have hedged approximately million gallons of our appalachian ngl production volumes governed by keep whole contracts 
for these hedged production volumes  we have hedged our processing margin by simultaneously hedging the expected ngl product sales and the related cost of our replacement natural gas 
also  under our new hedging practice we have hedged an additional million gallons of our appalachian ngl sales volumes governed by keep whole contracts 
we have hedged approximately million gallons of our michigan ngl production volumes governed by percent of proceeds contracts 
as of february   under our historicial hedging practice  we have hedged approximately  mmbtu d of our expected e p production for the year our annual sensitivities to changes in commodity prices considering our hedge position is as follows 
for every per mmbtu increase in the natural gas price  our gross margin defined as revenue less cost of sales would decrease by million 
for every per barrel reduction in the crude oil price  or per gallon reduction in ngl prices  our gross margin would decrease by million 
credit risk counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations expose us to potential losses as a result of nonperformance 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe minimize overall credit risk 
such policies include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty s financial condition  collateral requirements where deemed necessary  and the use of standardized agreements  which facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty 
we also monitor the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis 
in general  our risk of default by these counterparties is low 
however  we recently experienced a loss as described below 
sfas no 
provides that hedge accounting must be discontinued on contracts when it becomes reasonably possible that the counterparty will default 
during the fourth quarter of  enron corporation and its subsidaries enron filed for bankruptcy protection 
in response to this filing  we have terminated all derivative contracts where enron was the counterparty 
as a result  we wrote off million of risk management assets related to our cash flow hedges offset by million of risk management liabilities related to our fair value hedges 
in addition  our contracts with enron provide for netting of amounts owed to each other and as such we have netted million in amounts payable to enron 
the net result of the above transactions is a charge of million to earnings in the fourth quarter in the case of discontinuing hedge accounting for cash flow hedges  sfas no 
provides the amount in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings in the periods of the forecasted transactions 
as such  we will be reclassifying million and million from other comprehensive income to revenue  net of million and million of deferred taxes for and  respectively 
while we enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that additional losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in canada and thus are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
we manage this risk in part through use of the canadian dollar component of our credit facility 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our long term debt with floating interest rates 
we may make use of interest rate swap agreements expiring june  to adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in the debt portfolio 
as of december   we are a party to contracts to fix interest rates on million of our debt at compared to floating libor  plus an applicable margin 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on our debt would result in an increase in interest expense and a decrease in income before taxes of approximately million 
this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate debt balances as of december
