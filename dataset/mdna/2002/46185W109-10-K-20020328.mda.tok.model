item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview through  our revenue was historically derived through four primary segments  it services  cti software  computer products and telecom systems  each of which were historically reported separately 
during the year ended december  we discontinued our telecom systems business and during the quarter ended march  we discontinued our computer products business 
we sold our telecom systems and computer products businesses in separate transactions during the first quarter of after the sale of these two businesses  in july  we separated what had been the it services business into three separate businesses  of which one was it staffing it staffing  inc and all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries 
during we sold our it staffing business 
we contributed the remaining components of the former it services business to two newly formed wholly owned corporations  allstar computer services  inc acs and synergy helpdesk solutions  inc synergy 
effective june  we merged synergy into acs and subsequently renamed that business to allstar solutions  inc allstar 
in july  we formed another wholly owned subsidiary  internetworking sciences  inc inx  a professional services organization that focuses on the design  deployment and support of large scale network infrastructure requirements 
in october inx acquired certain assets of an unrelated professional service company in the dallas area  which had a similar focus  and subsequently underwent a legal name change to internetwork experts  inc our cti software business was not affected by the sale of the computer products and telecom systems business units  however we are now referring to this segment by its corporate name  stratasoft rather than cti software as we have in the past 
we market our services businesses in texas from locations in the houston and dallas fort worth metropolitan areas 
stratasoft markets its products worldwide through a direct sales force and an authorized dealer network 
by operating through these highly focused wholly owned subsidiaries  we believe that we will offer better customer service  and improve our financial performance 
cost of sales and services includes the cost of products sold  amounts paid to outside contractors for services performed that are related to a particular sale and the wages and related taxes and employee benefits paid to technical staff that perform the services that we provide to our customers 
a certain component of total technical staff wages and related costs are of a fixed nature  and therefore gross margin will vary to the extent that services revenues fluctuate from period to period 
gross margin varies substantially between each of these business segments 
over the past three years gross margin in allstar has ranged between and and gross margin for stratasoft has ranged between to 
as a newly formed business  inx experienced negative gross margin of in  but improved its gross margin to in a significant portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses relate to personnel costs  some of which are variable and others of which are relatively fixed 
our variable personnel costs are primarily comprised of sales commissions  which are typically calculated based upon our gross profit on a particular sales transaction and thus generally fluctuate with our overall gross profit 
the remainder of our selling  general and administrative expenses are relatively more fixed and  while still somewhat variable  do not vary with increases in revenue as do sales commissions 
discontinued operations and sales of certain business units sale of it staffing on november   we approved a plan to sell our it staffing subsidiary and as a consequence  the operations of it staffing are reported as discontinued operations

we maintained a cash position sufficient to pay only our immediately due obligations and expenses 
subsequent to the sale of the computer products division we had sufficient cash on hand to meet our requirements and have not had to rely on our line of credit 
because of the significant growth we are experiencing  we have entered into a  credit line agreement with textron financial corporation  effective january  inx is concentrating its sales efforts on cisco technology 
while we do buy cisco product through wholesale distributors  inx has begun to buy its product direct through cisco as its primary supplier in order to obtain competitive pricing and better product availability 
we have invested our excess cash in interest bearing overnight deposits 
our working capital was   and  at december   and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital during is primarily due to the use of working capital to invest in the growth of our inx subsidiary and their operating losses during that start up period 
the increase in working capital during is primarily due to the collection of receivables related to the discontinued operations of the computer products and the telecom businesses 
the proceeds of the sale of the computer products business were used to pay off our previous line of credit

accounts receivable increased  during  respectively and decreased  and during and  respectively 
inventory decreased  and in  and  respectively 
the most recent two years reductions were primarily the result of collection of receivables retained from discontinued operations 
investing activities used cash totaling and during and  respectively and provided cash of  during our investing activities that used cash during these periods were primarily related to capital expenditures related to leasehold improvements and patent license acquisitions 
in  investing activities primarily related to the proceeds from the sale of the computer products business 
during the next twelve months  we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures 
financing activities used cash totaling   and during  and  respectively 
the primary source of cash from financing activities in was borrowings on our lines of credit when the lines of credit were used principally to satisfy our cash requirements  including financing increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
during we used the proceeds of the sale of the computer products business to pay off our line of credit 
during  and we used  and  respectively to repurchase shares that were held in treasury at the end of asset management our cash flow from operations has been affected primarily by the timing of our collection of accounts receivable 
we have typically sold our products and services on short term credit terms and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
we had accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  including and relating to discontinued operations at december  and  respectively we attempt to manage our inventory in order to minimize the amount of inventory held for resale and the risk of inventory obsolescence and decreases in market value 
we attempt to maintain a level of inventory required to reach only our near term requirements by relying on the ready availability of products from our principal suppliers 
credit facilities at december   we had no credit facility in place 
on january  we entered into a credit agreement with textron financial corporation textron for a revolving line of credit the textron facility that will be our principal source of liquidity 
the total credit available under the credit facility is  subject to borrowing base limitations that are generally computed as of eligible accounts receivable  of identifiable inventory purchased under this agreement and of all other inventory 
credit available under this facility for floor plan financing of inventory from approved manufacturers is  we may use up to of the line for working capital advances under approved conditions 
borrowings under the line will accrue interest at the prime rate plus on outstanding balances that extend beyond the vendor approved free interest period and on working capital advances from date of advance 
inventory floor plan finance borrowings on the line are reflected in accounts payable on the accompanying balance sheets 
this agreement  which continues in full force and effect until terminated by written notice from us  is collaterized by substantially all of our assets 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants  which  among other things  require us to maintain minimum tangible capital funds and to not exceed a maximum debt to tangible capital funds ratio 
on september  stratasoft  our subsidiary  signed a note payable to a third party for  payable in monthly installments through february  the note does not bear interest and we have imputed interest at to record the debt and related patent asset and recorded interest of in this note payable is collaterized by stratasoft s patent assets 
stratasoft has granted a security interest in its pending patent application and the next two patent applications filed by stratasoft 
in connection with this note payable  we have reported short term debt maturing within one year of and long term debt of in october  we signed an non interest bearing auto note payable for payable in monthly installments through october in connection with this note payable  we have reported short term debt maturing within one year of and long term debt of at december  payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases  critical accounting policy revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized when the product is shipped 
service income is recognized as the services are earned 
revenues resulting from installations of equipment and software contracts for which duration is in excess of three months and that require substantial modification or customization are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of revenue recognized is determined principally on the basis of the relationship of the cost of work performed on the contract to estimated total costs 
revisions of estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts necessitating the revisions become known  when a contract indicates a loss  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss 
the following reflects the amounts relating to uncompleted contracts at december  and costs incurred on uncompleted contracts estimated earnings  less billings to date  cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings  billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings during our subsidiary  stratasoft  recognized revenues on the percentage of completion basis for several projects associated with one reseller in south asia 
i sector has risk to the extent that this group of customers have not paid or issued contractual letters of credit up to the level of cost and earnings recognized 
on the projects in south asia we required a cash payment or letter of credit from the customer prior to shipping the product

future trends we expect continued revenue increases in and beyond  due primarily to market share gains 
while we expect all three of our subsidiary companies to produce significant revenue growth in  we expect the newer inx to produce the most rapid growth rates  although not at the same growth rates experienced in  their first full year of operations 
we expect that this revenue growth in will be primarily a result of the investments made in late and throughout in the form of increased sales and marketing staff and marketing programs 
we expect gross margin to improve in for both inx and allstar solutions  primarily because of improved utilization of technical staffing resources in the services component of their revenue bases 
we expect gross margin for stratasoft to decline somewhat from the higher than normal level achieved in due primarily to a more normalized hardware product component as compared to the lower than normal hardware mix in a higher mix of hardware in the stratasoft package produces lower gross margin 
overall  we expect total consolidated company gross margin to decline slightly due primarily to a higher proportion of lower margin inx revenue in the total revenue mix 
we expect to be able to contain the growth in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  as revenue continues to grow because of previous investments in sales and marketing  without a further commensurate increase in sales and marketing expenses and as the increases in revenues are spread over a relatively fixed corporate administration expense base 
for we expect our business to be positively impacted by a slight improvement in the depressed general market conditions that we experienced in  due primarily to a likely upswing in the cyclical buying patterns of customers for technology products 
in we experienced the depressing combined events of a declining stock market  slowing economy and terrorist activity
