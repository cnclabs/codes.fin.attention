critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
however  certain of the company s accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by the company s management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  the company s management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on the company s historical experience  terms of existing contracts  the company s observance of trends in the industry  information provided by the company s customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the company s critical accounting policies include inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
the company evaluates the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
accounting for acquisitions 
acquisition activities are an important element of the company s business strategy 
the company s acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that may be incurred 
the determination of the fair value of such intangible assets and other assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets
