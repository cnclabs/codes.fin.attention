overview we are an independent provider of multi channel application software technology and associated services for the retail industry including enterprise  direct to consumer and store solutions and related training products and professional and support services 
our applications and services represent a full suite of offerings that provide retailers with a complete end to end business solution 
we also develop and distribute pc courseware and skills assessment products for both desktop and retail applications 
we developed our retail application software technology and services business through acquisitions 
the largest and most important of these acquisitions were o applied retail solutions  inc ars in july for aggregate consideration of million in cash and stock paid to the former stockholders  and o island pacific systems corporation in april for million cash 
island pacific is one of the leading providers of retail enterprise applications 
ars was one of the leading providers of store applications  and the technology we acquired and have subsequently enhanced now forms the core of our svi store solutions 
we accounted for both the island pacific and ars acquisitions using purchase accounting  which has resulted in the addition of significant goodwill and capitalized software assets on our balance sheet 
we amortized capitalized software and goodwill from both of these acquisitions using ten year lives through march  see significant accounting policies below 
effective april   we restructured our operations into three strategic business units lead by experienced managers 
the business units are island pacific  svi store solutions and svi training products  inc our operations are conducted principally in the united states and the united kingdom 
prior to february  we also conducted business in australia 
we currently derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of application software licenses and the provision of related professional and support services 
application software license fees are dependent upon the sales volume of our customers  the number of users of the application s  and or the number of locations in which the customer plans to install and utilize the application s 
as the customer grows in sales volume  adds additional users and or adds additional locations  we charge additional license fees 
we typically charge for support  maintenance and software updates on an annual basis pursuant to renewable maintenance contracts 
we typically charge for professional services including consulting  implementation and project management services on an hourly basis 
our sales cycles for new license sales historically ranged from three to twelve months  but new license sales were limited during the past two fiscal years and sales cycles are now difficult to estimate 
our long sales cycles have in the past caused our revenues to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the reduction of new license sales caused the revenues of our australian subsidiary to decrease substantially prior to discontinuation of operations in february  and our sales mix in the us and the uk to shift to lower margin services 
we evaluate local operations primarily based on total revenues and earnings before interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization and impairment charges as shown below

the geographic distribution of our revenues and long lived assets for the fiscal years ended march    and is as follows in thousands year ended year ended year ended march  march  march  in thousands net sales united states    australia discontinued operations    south africa discontinued operations  united kingdom    total net sales    long lived assets united states    australia discontinued operations   united kingdom total long lived assets    up to march   we classified our operations into two lines of business retail solutions and training products 
as revenues  results of operations and assets related to our training products subsidiary were below the threshold established for segment reporting  we consider our business for the fiscal year ended march  to have consisted of one reportable operating segment 
effective april   we operate under three strategic business units 
each of these units will be measured separately against their individual business plans 
results of operations for fiscal reflect continued weakness in new license sales of our application software suites 
as a result of our net losses  we experienced significant strains on our cash resources throughout the fiscal year 
we have taken a number of affirmative steps to address our operating situation and liquidity problems  and to position us for improved results of operations 
o in the third quarter of  we completed an analysis of our operations and concluded that it was necessary to restructure the composition of our management and personnel 
we were concerned that the new management team had not been able to close a number of new business opportunities or to raise capital 
we were also concerned with general economic conditions  especially after the terrorist attacks of september   and the resulting ongoing hostilities in the world 
our ceo  thomas a 
dorosewicz  and our cfo  kevin m 
o neill  elected to leave to pursue other interests  and both resigned from our board of directors 
we appointed barry m 
schechter  our chairman  as chief executive officer  and jackie tran  our controller  as acting chief financial officer 
we also reduced our staff by a total of  and restructured and refocused our sales force toward opportunities available in the current economic climate 
this reorganization resulted in costs savings of approximately million per year 
o in the fourth quarter of  we appointed experienced managers to manage our island pacific and svi store solutions operations 
we also appointed an experienced vice president of sales to the team 
o we developed measurable budgets for each divisional operation so as to measure performance directly and maintain control over expenditures 
o we restructured our application development efforts in concert with our new marketing and technology management team to work more closely with customers for improvements to our offerings 
we expect the result will be application technology that more closely meets the needs of our customers 
additionally  more of the costs of development may be offset against customer specific revenues 
o we issued a total of million in convertible notes to a limited number of accredited investors related to icm asset management  inc of spokane  washington  a significant beneficial owner of our common stock 
in july  we amended these notes to extend the maturity date and other provisions  and we replaced the warrants issued to these investors 
see financing transactions icm asset management  inc below 
o we relocated our principal executive offices to smaller and less expensive premises in carlsbad  california 
o we negotiated an extension of our senior bank lending facility to august  see liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations union bank below 
o we completed an integrated series of transaction with softline to repay our subordinated note to softline  to transfer to softline our note received in connection with the sale of ibis systems limited  and to issue new series a convertible preferred securities in exchange for  svi common shares 
see financing transactions softline below 
o our australian subsidiary ceased operations in february see discontinued operations below 
o in may  we entered into a new two year software development and services agreement with our largest customer  toys r us  inc toys also agreed to invest million for the purchase of a non recourse convertible note and a warrant to purchase  common shares 
for a further details  see financing transactions toys r us below 
for a further discussion of our plans to address our net losses and negative working capital  see note to our financial statements included with this report 
discontinued operations due to the declining performance of our australian subsidiary  we decided in the third quarter of fiscal to sell certain assets of the australian subsidiary to the former management of such subsidiary  and then cease australian operations 
such sale was however subject to the approval of national australia bank  the subsidiary s secured lender 
the bank did not approve the sale and the subsidiary ceased operations in february the bank caused a receiver to be appointed in february to sell substantially all of the assets of the australian subsidiary and pursue collections on any outstanding receivables 
the receiver proceeded to sell substantially all of the assets for  in may to the entity affiliated with former management  and is actively pursuing the collection of receivables 
if the sale proceeds plus collections on receivables are insufficient to discharge the indebtedness to national australia bank  we may be called upon to pay the deficiency under our guarantee to the bank 
we have accrued  as the maximum amount of our potential exposure 
the receiver has also claimed that we are obligated to it for inter company balances of  but we do not believe any amounts are owed to the receiver  who has not as of the date of this report acknowledged the monthly corporate overhead recovery fees and other amounts charged by us to the australian subsidiary offsetting the amount claimed to be due 
for further details  see liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations national australia bank below 
the disposal of our australian subsidiary resulted in a loss of million 
the operating results of the australian subsidiary are shown on our financial statements as discontinued operations with the prior period results restated 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  based on historical experience  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements o revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses such as commissions and royalties 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
we license software under non cancelable agreements and provide related services  including consulting and customer support 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants 
we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  during the first quarter of sab provides further interpretive guidance for public companies on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our licensing or revenue recognition practices 
software license revenue is generally recognized when a license agreement has been signed  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if a software license contains an undelivered element  the fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered 
in addition  if a software license contains customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  the software revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
typically  payments for our software licenses are due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
where software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the date of delivery  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred license  prepaid services revenue and maintenance support revenue 
consulting services are separately priced  are generally available from a number of suppliers  and are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
consulting services  which include project management  system planning  design and implementation  customer configurations  and training are billed on both an hourly basis and under fixed price contracts 
consulting services revenue billed on an hourly basis is recognized as the work is performed 
on fixed price contracts  consulting services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating hours incurred to date to total estimated hours at completion 
we have from time to time provided software and consulting services under fixed price contracts that require the achievement of certain milestones 
the revenue under such arrangements is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
customer support services include post contract support and the rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements 
maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support services are billed on a monthly basis and recorded as revenue in the applicable month  or on an annual basis with the revenue being deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
if an arrangement includes multiple elements  the fees are allocated to the various elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
o accounts receivable 
we typically extend credit to our customers 
software licenses are generally due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
billings for customer support and consulting services performed on a time and material basis are due upon receipt 
from time to time software and consulting services are provided under fixed price contracts where the revenue and the payment of related receivable balances are due upon the achievement of certain milestones 
management estimates the probability of collection of the receivable balances and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an evaluation of our customers ability to pay and general economic conditions 
o valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of march  in our fiscal year  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization during fiscal and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during fiscal financing transactions amro international  sa on october   the sec declared effective a registration statement registering up to  shares of our common stock for resale by amro international  sa amro purchased  shares in march for approximately million  and under the terms of the purchase agreement  was entitled to receive additional shares of our common stock if the average of the closing price of our stock for the five days preceding the effective date of the registration statement was less than 
pursuant to the repricing formula  we issued to amro  additional shares of common stock 
we became obligated to pay to amro liquidated damages for late effectiveness of the registration statement in the amount of  amro agreed in march to accept  shares of common stock in satisfaction of the liquidated damages  and agreed to purchase an additional  shares of common stock for  in connection with this agreement  we issued amro a two year warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at per share 
we may call the warrant for per share if our common stock trades above per share for twenty consecutive trading days and the warrant shares are registered with the sec for resale or otherwise salable by amro without restriction 
amro will have thirty days after the call to exercise the warrant  after which time the warrant will expire 
we agreed to register all of the shares sold in march  and those that we may sell under the warrant  with the sec 
we became obligated to pay to amro as liquidated damages the amount of  in april  amro agreed to accept  shares of common stock in satisfaction of the liquidated damages 
icm asset management  inc 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell up to  common shares to a limited number of accredited investors related to icm asset management  inc for cash at per share 
we sold  of such shares in december  for gross proceeds of million  and an additional  shares in january  for additional gross proceeds of million 
two of the investors exercised a right to purchase an additional  shares in february for additional gross proceeds of million 
we also agreed to issue to each investor a warrant to purchase one common share at for each two common shares purchased in the private placement aggregate warrants exercisable into  option shares 
we had the right to call of the warrants  subject to certain conditions  if our common shares traded at a price above per share for thirty consecutive days 
we had the right to call the remaining of the warrants  subject to certain conditions  if our common shares traded at a price above per share for thirty consecutive days 
we agreed to register all of the shares sold under the purchase agreement or the warrants with the sec 
our agreement with the investors provided that if a registration statement was not effective on or before april   we would be obligated to issue two year warrants to each investor  entitling the investor to purchase additional shares of our common stock at per share 
we filed a registration statement in january to register these shares  but it did not become effective 
as of june   we had issued the investors warrants to purchase  common shares under this agreement 
in may and june  we issued a total of million in convertible notes to a limited number of accredited investors related to icm 
the notes were originally due august   and required interest at the rate of per annum to be paid until maturity  with the interest rate increasing to after maturity 
any portion of the unpaid amount of principal and interest was convertible at any time by the investors into common shares valued at per share 
we also agreed to issue to the investors three year warrants to purchase common shares for each  in notes purchased  at an exercise price of per share 
in july  we agreed to amend the terms of the notes and warrants issued to the investors related to icm 
the investors agreed to replace the existing notes with new notes having a maturity date of september  the interest rate on the new notes was reduced to per annum  increasing to in the event of a default in payment of principal or interest 

we are required to pay accrued interest on the new notes calculated from july   in quarterly installments beginning september  
the investors agreed to reduce accrued interest and late charges on the original notes up to  and to accept the reduced amount in shares of our common stock valued at the average closing price of our shares on the american stock exchange for the trading days prior to july  the new notes are convertible at the option of the holders into shares of our common stock valued at per share 
we do not have a right to prepay the notes 
we also agreed that the warrants previously issued to the investors to purchase an aggregate of  shares at exercise prices ranging from to  and expiring on various dates between december and june  would be replaced by new warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares at per share  expiring july  we anticipate that warrants for an additional  shares will be exchanged for warrants for  shares on substantially identical terms 
the replacement warrants are not callable by us 
we also agreed to file a registration statement for the resale of all shares held by or obtainable by these investors 
in the event such registration statement is not declared effective by the sec within days after july   we will be obligated to issue five year penalty warrants for the purchase of of the total number of registrable securities at an exercise price of per share 
we will be obligated to issue additional penalty warrants for each day period after such date in which the registration statement is not effective 
no further penalty warrants will accrue from our original registration obligation 
softline in may  we entered into an integrated series of transactions with softline by which we transferred to softline the note received in connection with the sale of ibis systems ltd 
we issued to softline  shares of newly designated series a convertible preferred stock 
softline released us from approximately million in indebtedness due to softline under a promissory note 
softline surrendered  shares of the our common shares held by softline 
the series a preferred stock has a stated value of per share and is redeemable at our option any time prior to the maturity date of december  for of the stated value and accrued and unpaid dividends 
the shares are entitled to cumulative dividends of per annum  payable semi annually when  as and if declared by the board of directors

we have the right of first refusal to purchase all but not less than all of any shares of series a preferred stock or common shares received on conversion which softline may propose to sell to a third party  upon the same price and terms as the proposed sale to a third party 
we also granted softline certain registration rights for the common shares into which the series a preferred is convertible  including the right to demand registration on form s if such form is available to us and softline proposes to sell at least million of registrable common shares  and the right to include shares obtainable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock in other registration statements we propose to file 
these transactions were recorded for accounting purposes on january   the date when softline took effective control of the ibis note and ceased accruing interest on the softline note 
we did not recognize any gain or loss in connection with the disposition of the ibis note or the other components of the transactions 
toys r us in may  toys r us agreed to invest million for the purchase of a non recourse convertible note and a warrant to purchase  common shares 
the purchase price is payable in installments through september  the note is non interest bearing  and the face amount is payable in shares of our stock valued at per share 
the note is due may   or if earlier than that date  three years after the completion of the development project contemplated in the development agreement between us and toys entered into at the same time 
we do not have the right to prepay the convertible note before the due date  but upon the due date  we may at our option pay the principal amount in cash rather than shares to the extent toys did not earlier convert the note to shares 
the face amount of the note is of the million purchase price as of may   and increases by of the million purchase price on the last day of each succeeding month  until february   when the face amount is the full million purchase price 
the face amount will cease to increase if toys terminates its development agreement with us for a reason other than our breach 
the face amount will be zero if we terminate the development agreement due to an uncured breach by toys of the development agreement 
the warrant entitles toys to purchase up to  of our common shares at per share 
the warrant is initially vested as to  shares as of may   and vests at the rate of  shares per month until february  the warrant will cease to vest if toys terminates its development agreement with us for a reason other than our breach 
the warrant will become entirely non exercisable if we terminate the development agreement due to an uncured breach by toys of the development agreement

we believe our difficulties initially arose from insufficient staffing of our sales force 
although we significantly increased the staffing of our sales force in the first quarter of fiscal  the economic slowdown and the terrorist attacks of september   and the ongoing hostilities in the world increased the challenges faced by our sales force 
in addition  our financial condition may have interfered with our ability to sell new application software licenses  as implementation of our applications generally requires extensive future services and support  and some potential customers have expressed concern about our financial ability to provide these ongoing services 
we believe strongly that we provide and will continue to provide excellent support to our customers  as demonstrated by the continuing upgrade purchases by our top tier established customer base 
significant sales growth may however depend in part on our ability to improve our financial condition 
in october  we took aggressive steps designed to improve sales of new application software licenses  and to streamline our operations around services to our existing customers 
these steps included a restructuring of our operations and repositioning of the sales force to better focus on the historical markets of our retail enterprise solution and our retail store solution 
this strategy has permitted us to reduce overhead expenses  while allowing us to target those markets most likely to result in sales in the current economic climate 
our newly focused sales force has also begun to aggressively market individual modules within our suites 
these modules have been improved through modification services performed for existing customers  and may now be marketed as separate applications to new customers 
these modules are suited to those potential customers looking for incremental upgrades to their systems at a substantially lower cost  and with a substantially reduced implementation commitment  than an upgrade to our full suite would require 
we intend to add additional sales personnel at such time as the economic climate and market for our products permits 
in july  we entered into an agreement to expand our current professional services activities with toys r us significantly through september in may  we entered into a new development agreement with toys for the provision of development services through february we expect the overall dollar amount of professional services we perform for toys in to be comparable to fiscal  and to continue to be a significant source of professional services revenues in fiscal toys accounted for of our net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal cost of sales gross profit cost of sales increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin was due to a further shift in the sales mix from high margin application licenses to lower margin software modification and professional services 
during fiscal  application technology license revenues represented of net sales and related services represented of net sales  compared to and of net sales  respectively  of net sales during fiscal cost of sales for fiscal and included million and million  respectively  in costs associated with the development or modification of modules for toys r us  including the use of higher cost outsource development services subcontractors for certain components of the overall project 
these costs are neither capitalized nor included in application technology development expenses  but we consider them to be part of our overall application technology development program 
application development expense application development expense for the fiscal year ended march  was million as most development expenditures were client funded compared to million for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of 
the decrease reflects a shift toward customer funded development expenses 
for a further discussion of our application technology development program  see description of business under the heading application technology development above 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease was due to the following o personnel reduction implemented in the fourth quarter of and third quarter of and control of expenditures 
o a million reserve for bad debts in fiscal during the third quarter of  we completed an analysis of our operations and concluded that it was necessary to restructure the composition of our management and personnel 
we anticipated that the restructuring would result in an approximately million annual reduction in our expense levels compared to expenses prior to implementation of the plan 
to the extent resources are available  we expect to slowly increase our expense levels in fiscal from the reduced level after the reductions in the third quarter of fiscal additional planned expenditures are for the building of our sales force and for additions to our professional services group for us and uk retail operations as new licenses and services are sold 
earnings loss from continuing operations and before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and impairments the loss from continuing operations and before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  and impairments of intangible assets and notes receivable was million for the year ended march  as compared to a comparable loss from continuing operations of million in the year ended march   representing an improvement of million 
the gross profit for the year decreased by million and other income by million  but was offset by improvements primarily from reduced application development expenses in the amount of million  and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease reflected the reduction in the base amounts of goodwill and capitalized software assets resulting from the recognition of impairments of those assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
 we will not amortize goodwill in fiscal we will likely however record impairment charges based upon the transitional analysis of goodwill impairment required by sfas  and we may record impairment charges based upon the impairment testing procedures required by sfas interest income and expense interest expense was million in the fiscal years ended march  and interest income decreased million to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal due to cessation of the accrual of interest income on the note receivable received in connection with the sale of ibis after the second quarter of fiscal discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations in fiscal was million  which included million of net loss from australian operations and million of loss on disposal 
loss from discontinued operations in fiscal was million 
net sales from australian operations decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales net sales increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  fiscal year revenues included recognition of million in revenue from a one time sale of technology rights which was signed in fiscal in addition to those factors  the decrease in net sales was principally due to a million decrease in revenue from our united kingdom retail operations reflecting a substantial decrease in new application license sales 
the substantial decrease in new application license sales was due in part to our inability to close several larger application license transactions in our sales pipeline 
cost of sales gross profit cost of sales increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin was due to a shift in the sales mix from high margin application licenses to lower margin software modification and professional services

during fiscal  we continued our application technology development program begun in fiscal to improve and integrate our application software 
for a further discussion of our application technology development program  see description of business under the heading application technology development above 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase was due to the following o one time personnel reduction charge of million in the fourth quarter associated with the reorganization of our svi retail operations in irvine and san diego  california 
o an increase in professional fees and allowances of million 
o increased personnel expense  in part due to our acquisition of marketplace systems corporation 
earnings loss from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and impairments the loss from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and impairments of intangible assets and notes receivable was million for the year ended march  as compared to a comparable profit from continuing operations of million in the year ended march   representing a reduction of million 
the gross profit for the year decreased by million and other income by million  application development expenses increased by million and selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase was due to the amortization of software purchased in connection with the acquisition of marketplace systems corporation in march  and to amortization of capitalized software that was made available for sale in fiscal impairment of assets our march  balance sheet includes a million note receivable 
this note was secured by  shares or approximately of the outstanding common stock of integrity software  inc we do not believe the obligor under the note has significant assets other than the integrity shares securing the note 
the obligor is an entity affiliated with integrity  and its ability to sell the integrity shares to repay the note is limited by law and by market conditions 
during the fiscal year ended march   we determined that the value of this note receivable was impaired  and we wrote off a total of million as a valuation allowance 
we obtained an independent valuation of the integrity shares securing the note at march   which supported the value shown on our march  balance sheet 
this note and the shares securing it were transferred to softline effective january  see financing transactions softline above 
we also recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal an impairment of million in capitalized software and goodwill associated with australian operations 
in determining the amount of impairment  we compared the net book value of the long lived assets associated with the australian subsidiary  primarily consisting of recorded goodwill and software intangibles  to their estimated fair values 
fair values were estimated based on anticipated future cash flows of the australian operations  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
interest income and expense interest expense increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase was due to inclusion for the full fiscal year of interest from indebtedness incurred in june to purchase island pacific  and an increase in our average interest rate to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase also included million in amortized loan refinancing costs  including million of amortized loan cost reimbursement to softline 
interest income decreased million to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal due to decreased cash and cash equivalents

at march  and  we had cash of million 
operating activities provided cash of million in the fiscal year ended march  and used cash of million in the fiscal year ended march  and million in the fiscal year ended march  cash provided for operating activities in fiscal resulted primarily from million decrease in accounts receivable and other receivables  million increase in deferred revenue  million in non cash depreciation and amortization  million of loss on disposal of australian operations  million increase in interest payable and million in non cash charges for stock based compensation and interest related to convertible notes due stockholders  offset by million of net losses and million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses

cash used for operating activities during fiscal year primarily resulted from a million net loss  a million increase in accounts receivable and other receivables  a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a million increase in interest receivable  a million decrease in income tax payable  and a million increase in deferred income taxes liability  offset in part by million of non cash depreciation and amortization expense and a million increase in deferred revenue 
accounts receivable decreased during fiscal year primarily due to a write off of  in receivables in connection with the discontinuation of australian operations in february and a significant improvement in collection efforts 
accounts receivable decreased during fiscal year primarily due to payment during fiscal of million from the one time sale of technology rights during fiscal  the write off during the fourth quarter of fiscal of the million outstanding balance remaining from the one time sale of technology rights and a decrease in trade receivables aged over days as a result of improvement in collection efforts 
accounts receivable increased during fiscal year primarily due to the inclusion of island pacific accounts receivable of million at march  and the million total receivable associated with the non recurring sale of technology rights 
accounts receivable balances fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors including acquisitions and dispositions  seasonality  shifts in customer buying patterns  contractual payment terms  the underlying mix of applications and services sold  and geographic concentration of revenues 
investing activities used cash of million  million  and million in the fiscal years ended march   and investing activities during fiscal included a million increase in capitalized software development costs and million in furniture and equipment purchases

changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign operations had the effect of decreasing cash by million in the fiscal years ended march  and and million in the fiscal year ended march  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  including purchase commitments at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
for the fiscal years ending march  contractual obligations thereafter in thousands operating leases capital leases term loans  convertible notes due stockholders  demand loans due stockholders payables aged over days other long term obligations total contractual obligations   for the fiscal years ending march  other commercial commitments thereafter in thousands guarantees union bank on june   we entered into an amended and restated loan agreement with union bank with respect to the million owing under the our term loan 
the maturity date under the restated agreement was may   but we had a right to extend that date to november  if we satisfied certain conditions  including our achieving certain earnings targets 
we are required to pay monthly interest at over the bank reference rate  increased by an additional for late payments of principal and interest 
we were required to make an initial  principal payment in august  and monthly principal payments of  beginning october  monthly principal payments were to increase to  on may  upon an extension of the maturity date 
we had difficulty making both interest and principal payments during fiscal  and the bank extended on several occasions the due dates for required payments 
we are required to use any proceeds in excess of million we receive from private equity placements to reduce principal under the loan 
we are also prohibited from making any payments on certain subordinated obligations  including the icm convertible notes 
the entire amount owed to the bank is secured by substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries and  shares of our treasury stock 
the restated agreement also contains limitations on acquisitions  investments and other borrowings 
we agreed to pay the bank a loan restructuring fee of  originally due may  or if the maturity date is extended   on may  and  on november   but the fee would be waived if we discharged the loan before may  we are also required to reimburse the bank for certain other expenses incurred during the term of the loan 
on march   the loan agreement was amended to release certain collateral from the pledge to union bank  and to instead pledge to the bank the  shares of our common stock surrender by softline in the related recapitalization transactions with softline described above under the heading financing transactions softline 
the released collateral was our shares in our australian subsidiary  and the ibis note and related shares of integrity software 
on may   the bank further amended the agreement to extend the maturity date to may  and to revise other terms and conditions 
we agreed to pay to the bank  as a loan extension fee  payable in four monthly installments of  each commencing on june  if we failed to pay any installment when due  the loan extension fee was to increase to  and the monthly payments were to increase accordingly 
we also agreed to pay all overdue interest and principal by june   and to pay monthly installments of  commencing on june  and ending april  for the bank s legal fees 
we were not able to make the payments required in june we were also out of compliance with certain financial covenants as of june  effective july   the bank further amended the restated term loan agreement  and waived the then existing defaults 
under this third amendment to the restated agreement  the bank agreed to waive the application of the additional interest rate for late payments of principal and interest  and to waive the additional  refinance fee required by the second amendment 
the bank also agreed to convert  in accrued and unpaid interest and fees to term loan principal  and we executed a new term note in total principal amount of million 
we are required to make a principal payment of  on october   principal payments of  on each of november  and december   and consecutive monthly principal payments of  each on the th day of each month thereafter through august  the entire amount of principal and accrued interest is due august  the bank also agreed to eliminate certain financial covenants and to ease others  and we are in compliance with the revised covenants 
we also agreed to issue a contingent warrant to an affiliate of the bank to purchase up to of the number of outstanding common shares on january  for per share 
the warrant will be issued exercisable for shares equal to of our outstanding common stock on january   and will become exercisable for shares equal to an additional of our outstanding common stock on the first day each month thereafter  until it is exercisable for the full of our outstanding common stock 
the warrant will not become exercisable to the extent that we have discharged in full our bank indebtedness prior to a vesting date 
accordingly  the warrant will not become exercisable for any shares if we discharge our bank indebtedness in full prior to january   and if the warrant does become partially exercisable on such date  it will cease further vesting as of the date we discharge in full the bank indebtedness 
national australia bank limited our australian subsidiary maintained an aus  approximately us  line of credit facility with national australia bank limited 
the facility was secured by substantially all of the assets of our australian subsidiary  and we have guaranteed all amounts owing on the facility 
in april  we received a formal demand under our guarantee for the full aus  approximately us  then alleged by the bank to be due under the facility 
due to the declining performance of our australian subsidiary  we decided in the third quarter of fiscal to sell certain assets of the australian subsidiary to the former management of such subsidiary  and then cease australian operations 
such sale was however subject to the approval of national australia bank  the subsidiary s secured lender 
the bank did not approve the sale and the subsidiary ceased operations in february the bank caused a receiver to be appointed in february to sell substantially all of the assets of the australian subsidiary and pursue collections on any outstanding receivables 
the receiver proceeded to sell substantially all of the assets for  in may to the entity affiliated with former management  and is actively pursuing the collection of receivables 
if the sale proceeds plus collections on receivables are insufficient to discharge the indebtedness to national australia bank  we may be called upon to pay the deficiency under our guarantee to the bank 
we have accrued  as the maximum amount of our potential exposure 
the receiver has also claimed that we are obligated to it for inter company balances of  but we do not believe any amounts are owed to the receiver  who has not as of the date of this report acknowledged the monthly corporate overhead recovery fees and other amounts charged by us to the australian subsidiary offsetting the amount claimed to be due 
other indebtedness  including related parties in connection with our acquisition of island pacific  we also borrowed million with no stated maturity date from three entities in june million of such amount was borrowed from claudav holdings ltd 
bv  a significant stockholder 
the balance due on these loans at march  was million 
the loans bear interest at the prime rate and are due upon demand 
we issued convertible notes to entities related to icm asset management  inc  which notes are to be amended in july see financing transactions icm asset management  inc above 
in may  december and may  we borrowed   and  from world wide business centres  a company affiliated with donald s 
radcliffe  a director  to meet payroll expenses 
these amounts were repaid together with interest at the then effective prime rate  promptly as revenues were received  and are paid in full as of the date of this report 
cash position as a result of our indebtedness and net losses for the past three years  we have experienced significant strains on our cash resources 
in order to manage our cash resources  we reduced expenses and discontinued our australian operations 
we have also extended payment terms with many of our trade creditors wherever possible  and we have diligently focused our collection efforts on our accounts receivable 
we had a negative working capital of million and million at march  and  respectively 
we were unable to make timely  monthly rent payments due for our irvine and carlsbad facilities during the first quarter of fiscal we renegotiated rent terms with the landlords of our irvine and carlsbad facilities in june  and we are currently in compliance with the renegotiated terms 
as discussed above  we renegotiated on several occasions our agreements with union bank after we were unable to make payments which would have otherwise been required under these agreements 
other than cash on hand  we have no unused sources of liquid assets 
management has been actively engaged in attempts to resolve our liquidity problems 
we negotiated extensions of the maturity of our major indebtedness to the second quarter of fiscal  and as a result  we believe we will have sufficient cash to remain in compliance with our debt obligations  and meet our critical operating obligations  for the next twelve months 
we are nonetheless actively seeking a private equity placement to help discharge aged payables  pursue growth initiatives and prepay bank indebtedness 
we have no binding commitments for funding at this time 
financing may not be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives but requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that their value has diminished or been impaired 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of these intangibles on an annual basis to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
pursuant to sfas  amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce intangible assets recorded in business combinations prior to june  ceased effective march  goodwill resulting from business combinations completed after june   will not be amortized 
we recorded amortization expense of approximately million on goodwill during the fiscal year ended march  we currently estimate that application of the non amortization provisions of sfas will reduce amortization expense and increase net income by approximately million in fiscal we will test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment during the fiscal year and any resulting impairment charge will be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
under sfas  we are required to screen goodwill for potential impairment by september  and measure the amount of impairment  if any  by march  as of july   we have completed the transitional analysis of intangible asset impairment required by sfas  and we will record in the first quarter of fiscal impairments of million  million and million to goodwill  capitalized software and non compete agreements  respectively  as a cumulative change in accounting principles 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of long lived assets  except for certain obligations of lessees 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends apb opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale 
sfas requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value cost to sell 
additionally sfas expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the accounting prescribed in sfas was applied in connection with the disposal of our australian subsidiary 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
updates  clarifies  and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
this statement rescinds sfas no 
 which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
as a result  the criteria in apb no 
will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
sfas no 
amended sfas no 
and is no longer necessary as sfas no 
has been rescinded 
sfas no 
has been rescinded as it is no longer necessary 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions to be accounted for in the same manner as sale lease transactions 
this statement also makes technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
while those corrections are not substantive in nature  in some instances  they may change accounting practice 
we do not expect adoption of sfas no 
to have material impact  if any  on its financial position or results or operations 
in november  the fasb issued a staff announcement topic d topic d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
topic d establishes that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses should be reported as revenue in the income statement 
currently  we classify reimbursed out of pocket expenses as a reduction in cost of consulting services 
we are required to adopt the guidance of topic d in the first quarter of fiscal year and our consolidated statements of operations for prior periods will be reclassified to conform to the new presentation 
the adoption of topic d will result in an increase in reported net sales and cost of sales  however  it will not affect net income or loss in any past or future periods 
business risks investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this form k 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
in addition to those described below  risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business could be harmed  the price of our common stock could decline and our investors may lose all or part of their investment 
see the note regarding forward looking statements included at the beginning of this form k 
we incurred losses in fiscal years  and we incurred losses of million  million and million in the fiscal years ended march   and the losses in the past two years have generally been due to difficulties completing sales for new application software licenses  the resulting change in sales mix toward lower margin services  and debt service expenses 
we will need to generate additional revenue to achieve profitability in future periods 
failure to achieve profitability  or maintain profitability if achieved  may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
we have negative working capital  and we have extended payment terms with a number of our suppliers 
at march  and  we had negative working capital of million and million  respectively 
we have had difficulty meeting operating expenses  including interest payments on debt  lease payments and supplier obligations 
we have at times deferred payroll for our executives offices  and borrowed from related parties to meet payroll obligations 
we have extended payment terms with our trade creditors wherever possible 
as a result of extended payment arrangements with suppliers  we may be unable to secure products and services necessary to continue operations at current levels from these suppliers 
in that event  we will have to obtain these products and services from other parties  which could result in adverse consequences to our business  operations and financial condition 
our net sales have declined 
we experienced a substantial decrease in application software license sales 
our growth and profitability is dependent on the sale of higher margin licenses 
our net sales decreased by in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased compared to the fiscal year ended march  we experienced a substantial decrease in application license software sales  which typically carry a much higher margin than other revenue sources 
we must improve new application license sales to become profitable 
we have taken steps to refocus our sales strategy on core historic competencies  but our typically long sales cycles make it difficult to evaluate whether and when sales will improve 
we cannot be sure that the decline in sales has not been due to factors which might continue to negatively affect sales 
our financial condition may interfere with our ability to sell new application software licenses 
future sales growth may depend on our ability to improve our financial condition 
our current financial condition has made it more difficult for us to complete sales of new application software licenses 
because our applications typically require lengthy implementation and extended servicing arrangements  potential customers require assurance that these services will be available for the expected life of the application 
these potential customers may defer buying decisions until our financial condition improves  or may choose the products of our competitors whose financial condition is or is perceived to be stronger 
customer deferrals or lost sales will adversely affect our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
our sales cycles are long and prospects are uncertain 
this makes it difficult for us to predict revenues and budget expenses 
the length of sales cycles in our business makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our sales strategies 
our sales cycles historically ranged from three to twelve months  which caused significant fluctuations in revenues from period to period 
due to our difficulties in completing new application software sales in recent periods and our refocused sales strategy  it is difficult to predict revenues and properly budget expenses 
our software applications are complex and perform or directly affect mission critical functions across many different functional and geographic areas of the retail enterprise 
in many cases  our customers must change established business practices when they install our software 
our sales staff must dedicate significant time consulting with a potential customer concerning the substantial technical and business concerns associated with implementing our products 
the purchase of our products is often discretionary  so lengthy sales efforts may not result in a sale 
moreover  it is difficult to predict when a license sale will occur 
all of these factors can adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and they may continue to do so in the future  which could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if revenue declines in a quarter  our operating results will be adversely affected because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  sales and marketing  application development and general and administrative expenses do not change significantly with variations in revenue in a quarter 
it is likely that in some future quarter our net sales or operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if that happens  our stock price will likely decline 
our revenue may vary from period to period  which makes it difficult to predict future results 
factors outside our control that could cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly from period to period include o the size and timing of individual orders  particularly with respect to our larger customers  o general health of the retail industry and the overall economy  o technological changes in platforms supporting our software products  o customer order deferrals in anticipation of our and our competitors new offerings  and o market acceptance of new applications and related services 
the factors within our control include o acquisitions and dispositions of businesses  o changes in our strategies  and o non recurring sales of assets and technologies 
in particular  we usually deliver our software applications when contracts are signed  so order backlog at the beginning of any quarter may represent only a portion of that quarter s expected revenues 
as a result  application license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and delivered in that quarter  and this makes it difficult for us to accurately predict revenues 
we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  quarters or periods where individual application license or services orders are significantly larger than our typical application license or service orders 
because of the nature of our offerings  we may get one or more large orders in one quarter from a customer and then no orders the next quarter 
our expenses may vary from period to period  which could affect quarterly results and our stock price 
if we incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we do not experience increased revenue  our results of operations would be adversely affected and we may incur losses for that quarter 
factors that could cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include o the extent of marketing and sales efforts necessary to promote and sell our applications and services  o the timing and extent of our development efforts  and o the timing of personnel hiring 
it is difficult to evaluate our performance based on period to period comparisons of our results 
the many factors which can cause revenues and expenses to vary make meaningful period to period comparisons of our results difficult 
we do not believe period to period comparisons of our financial performance are necessarily meaningful  and you cannot rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
we may experience seasonal declines in sales  which could cause our operating results to fall short of expectations in some quarters 
we may experience slower sales of our applications and services from october through december of each year as a result of retailers focus on the holiday retail shopping season 
this can negatively affect revenues in our third fiscal quarter and in other quarters  depending on our sales cycles 
we have substantial debt which adversely affects us 
we have a substantial amount of debt  including the following as of july o a million term loan from union bank due august  the term loan is secured by substantially all of our assets and  shares of our treasury stock 
o million due to stockholders on demand 
o million in convertible notes to be reissued in july to entities related to icm asset management due september  the substantial amount of our indebtedness impacts us in a number of ways o we have to dedicate a portion of cash flow from operations to principal and interest payments on the debt  which reduces funds available for other purposes 
o we may not have sufficient funds to pay monthly principal and interest payments  which could lead to a default 
o the existing debt makes it difficult for us to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes 
o the debt detracts from our ability to successfully withstand downturns in our business or in the economy 
o if we default on our union bank indebtedness  the bank could take control of the substantial majority of our assets 
these factors generally place us at a disadvantage to our less leveraged competitors 
any or all of these factors could cause our stock price to decline 
during the past three fiscal years  we renegotiated on several occasions our agreements with union bank after we were unable to make payments required under these agreements 
union bank may not be willing to renegotiate our indebtedness in the future if we are unable to make required payments 
we will likely need outside sources of capital to make the required pay our union bank obligations upon maturity 
our bank loan imposes restrictions on us and on our ability to take important actions 
these restrictions may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
we are restricted by the terms of our outstanding union bank loan agreement from taking various actions  such as incurring additional indebtedness  paying dividends  paying subordinated obligations  entering into transactions with affiliates  merging with other entities and selling all or substantially all of our assets 
these restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain future financing  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general  or otherwise conduct our business 
we may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under the union bank loan 
a breach of any of these provisions could result in a default under the loan agreement  and upon a default  union bank could declare all indebtedness immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to pay those amounts  union bank could take control of the substantial majority of our assets 
fluctuations in interest rates could increase our interest expense and reduce cash available for other purposes 
our indebtedness with union bank and some of our other indebtedness require us to pay interest based on a rate which floats with market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  our interest expense will increase  which will reduce our earnings and reduce cash available for other purposes 
at march   our total borrowings subject to variable interest rates was million 
based on this balance  a one percent increase in interest rates would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
we have relied on capital contributed by related parties  and such capital may not be available in the future 
our cash from operations has not been sufficient to meet our operational needs  and we have relied on capital from related parties 
a company affiliated with donald s 
radcliffe  one of our directors  made short term loans to us in fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal to meet payroll when cash on hand was not sufficient 
softline loaned us million to make a required principal payment on our union bank term loan in july a subsidiary of softline loaned us an additional  in november to meet working capital needs 
this loan was repaid in february  in part with  we borrowed from barry m 
schechter  our chairman 
we borrowed an additional  from mr 
schechter in march for operational needs related to our australian subsidiary 
we may not be able to obtain capital from related parties in the future 
neither softline  mr 
schechter  mr 
radcliffe nor any other officers  directors  stockholders or related parties are under any obligation to continue to provide cash to meet our future liquidity needs 
we need to raise capital to repay debt and grow our business 
obtaining this capital could impair the value of your investment 
we need to raise capital to discharge our aged payables and grow our business 
we will also likely need to raise capital to pay our union bank obligations upon maturity in august we may also need to raise further capital to o support unanticipated capital requirements  o take advantage of acquisition or expansion opportunities  o continue our current development efforts  o develop new applications or services  or o address working capital needs 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our application development  sales and marketing activities 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or available on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise needed funds for the above purposes on acceptable terms  we may be forced to curtail some or all of the above activities and we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated developments 
we may raise capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and the new equity securities may have greater rights  preferences or privileges than our existing common stock 
intangible assets may be impaired making it more difficult to obtain financing 
goodwill  capitalized software  non compete agreements and other intangible assets represent of our total assets as of march  and represent more than our stockholders equity 
we may have to impair or write off these assets  which will cause a charge to earnings and could cause our stock price to decline 
any such impairments will also reduce our assets  as well as the ratio of our assets to our liabilities 
these balance sheet effects could make it more difficult for us to obtain capital  and could make the terms of capital we do obtain more unfavorable to our existing stockholders 
foreign currency fluctuations may impair our competitive position and affect our operating results 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect the prices of our applications and services and our expenses  and foreign currency losses will negatively affect profitability or increase losses 
approximately  and of our net sales were outside north america  principally in australia and the united kingdom  in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
many of our expenses related to foreign sales  such as corporate level administrative overhead and development  are denominated in us dollars 
when accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international sales and services are converted to us dollars  the resulting gain or loss contributes to fluctuations in our operating results 
we do not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risks 
if we cannot manage additional challenges presented by our international operations  our revenues and profitability may suffer 
a portion of our net sales are outside the united states and part of our growth strategy depends on increasing international sales 
if we cannot increase our international sales  we may not be able to achieve our business objectives 
we have already devoted resources to  and expect to continue to devote resources to  our expansion into foreign countries  particularly to expand our sales force 
to increase international sales in the future  we must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and further exploit strategic relationships 
the countries in which we operate may not have a sufficient pool of qualified personnel from which to hire  and we may not be successful at hiring  training or retraining personnel 
there are many risks inherent in our international business activities 
for example o we are subject to many foreign regulatory requirements which may change without notice  o our expenses related to sales and marketing and development may increase  o localizing products for foreign countries involves costs and risks of non acceptance  o we are subject to various export restrictions  and export licenses may not always be available  o we are subject to foreign tariffs and other trade barriers  o we may become subject to higher tax rates or taxation in more than one jurisdiction  o some of the foreign countries that we deal with suffer from political and economic instability  o we may have less protection for our intellectual property rights  o consulting  maintenance and service revenues may have lower margins in foreign countries  o we may not be able to move earnings back to the united states  o it can be more difficult to staff and manage our foreign operations  and o we may have difficulty collecting accounts receivable 
any of these factors could negatively affect our financial performance and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 
we have a single customer representing a significant amount of our business 
toys r us  accounted for  and of our net sales for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
while we have a development agreement with this customer  toys has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with limited advance notice 
a reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from toys r us would significantly reduce our revenues and force us to substantially curtail operations 
we cannot provide any assurances that toys r us or any of our current customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
if we lose the services of any member of our senior management or key technical and sales personnel  or if we are unable to retain or attract additional technical personnel  our ability to conduct and expand our business will be impaired 
we are heavily dependent on barry m 
schechter  our ceo  and on other key management personnel 
mr 
schechter has an employment agreement with us 
mr 
schechter s employment agreement expires september  and may be terminated on days notice 
we also believe our future success will depend largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled software programmers  managers  and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for personnel is intense  particularly in international markets 
the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
we compete against numerous companies  including larger  more established companies  for our personnel 
we may not be successful in attracting or retaining skilled sales  technical and managerial personnel 
the loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could negatively affect our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline 
we are dependent on the retail industry  and if economic conditions in the retail industry decline  our revenues may decline 
retail sales may be slowing 
our future growth is critically dependent on increased sales to the retail industry 
we derive the substantial majority of our revenues from the licensing of software applications and the performance of related professional and consulting services to the retail industry 
demand for our applications and services could decline in the event of consolidation  instability or downturns in the retail industry 
this decline would likely cause reduced sales and could impair our ability to collect accounts receivable 
the result would be reduced earnings and weakened financial condition  each or both of which would likely cause our stock price to decline 
the success of our customers is directly linked to economic conditions in the retail industry  which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions 
in addition  the retail industry may be consolidating  and it is uncertain how consolidation will affect the industry 
the retail industry as a whole is currently experiencing increased competition and weakening economic conditions that could negatively impact the industry and our customers ability to pay for our products and services 
such consolidation and weakening economic conditions have in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues  reduce the demand for our products and may negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
weakening economic conditions and the september  terrorist attack have adversely impacted sales of our software applications  and we believe mid tier specialty retailers may be reluctant during the current economic slowdown to make the substantial infrastructure investment that generally accompanies the implementation of our software applications 
there may be an increase in customer bankruptcies due to weak economic conditions we have in the past and may in the future be impacted by customer bankruptcies 
during weak economic conditions  such as those currently being experienced in many geographic regions around the world  there is an increased risk that certain of our customers will file bankruptcy 
when our customers file bankruptcy  we may be required to forego collection of pre petition amounts owed  and to repay amounts remitted to us during the day preference period preceding the filing 
accounts receivable balances related to pre petition amounts may in certain of these instances be large due to extended payment terms for software license fees  and significant billings for consulting and implementation services on large projects 
the bankruptcy laws  as well as the specific circumstances of each bankruptcy  may severely limit our ability to collect pre petition amounts  and may force us to disgorge payments made during the day preference period 
we also face risk from international customers which file for bankruptcy protection in foreign jurisdictions  in that the application of foreign bankruptcy laws may be less certain or harder to predict 
although we believe that we have sufficient reserves to cover anticipated customer bankruptcies  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate  and if they are not adequate  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our growth is dependent on developing our direct sales or expanding into other distribution channels 
other distribution channels create risks that we may not manage successfully 
in order to grow  we may find it necessary to expand our distribution channels beyond direct sales  which constitute the majority of our sales 
if we begin to use resellers  they may compete with our direct sales 
if we cannot expand our direct sales  develop additional distribution channels  or manage any potential channel conflicts  our sales may not grow 
if we cannot expand into certain market sectors  we may not be able to grow our business 
in order to grow our business  we need to expand our customer base and the types and size of retailers we serve 
we currently serve only the specialty goods  mass merchants and department store markets 
our applications and services may not gain acceptance in or meet the expectations and needs of other types and size of retailer or other sectors 
we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position because of the intense competition in the retail software industry 
we conduct business in an industry characterized by intense competition 
most of our competitors are very large companies with an international presence 
we must also compete with smaller companies which have been able to develop strong local or regional customer bases 
many of our competitors and potential competitors are more established  benefit from greater name recognition and have significantly greater resources than us 
our competitors may also have lower cost structures and better access to the capital markets than us 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
our competitors may o introduce new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive  o make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  which would increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our customers  and o establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners  which would limit our ability to compete through these channels 
we could be forced to reduce prices and suffer reduced margins and market share due to increased competition from providers of offerings similar to  or competitive with  our applications  or from service providers that provide services similar to our services 
competition could also render our technology obsolete 
for a further discussion of competitive factors in our industry  see description of business above under the heading competition 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  so our success depends heavily on our ability to develop and introduce new applications and related services 
the retail software industry is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
we must cost effectively develop and introduce new applications and related services that keep pace with technological developments to compete 
if we do not gain market acceptance for our existing or new offerings or if we fail to introduce progressive new offerings in a timely or cost effective manner  our financial performance will suffer 
the success of application enhancements and new applications depends on a variety of factors  including technology selection and specification  timely and efficient completion of design  and effective sales and marketing efforts 
in developing new applications and services  we may o fail to respond to technological changes in a timely or cost effective manner  o encounter applications  capabilities or technologies developed by others that render our applications and services obsolete or non competitive or that shorten the life cycles of our existing applications and services  o experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new applications and services  or o fail to achieve market acceptance of our applications and services 
the life cycles of our applications are difficult to estimate  particularly in the emerging electronic commerce market 
as a result  new applications and enhancements  even if successful  may become obsolete before we recoup our investment 
our proprietary rights offer only limited protection and our competitors may develop applications substantially similar to our applications and use similar technologies which may result in the loss of customers 
we may have to bring costly litigation to protect our proprietary rights 
our success and competitive position is dependent in part upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our intellectual property 
our intellectual property includes our trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and other proprietary information 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be successful 
effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
we hold no patents 
consequently  others may develop  market and sell applications substantially equivalent to ours or utilize technologies similar to those used by us  so long as they do not directly copy our applications or otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights 
we may find it necessary to bring claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to protect our trade secrets 
these actions would likely be costly and divert management resources 
these actions could also result in counterclaims challenging the validity of our proprietary rights or alleging infringement on our part 
the ultimate outcome of any litigation will be difficult to predict 
our applications may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation 
we may become involved in litigation involving patents or proprietary rights 
patent and proprietary rights litigation entails substantial legal and other costs  and we do not know if we will have the necessary financial resources to defend or prosecute our rights in connection with any such litigation 
responding to and defending claims related to our intellectual property rights  even ones without merit  can be time consuming and expensive and can divert management s attention from other business matters 
in addition  these actions could cause application delivery delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if they are available at all 
any or all of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our applications are not compatible with hardware or software products  our sales could suffer 
software sales can often be driven by advances in hardware or operating system technology 
if providers do not  or are unable to  continue to provide state of the art pos and enterprise hardware which runs our applications  our financial performance may suffer 
we do not develop hardware or operating systems  so we are dependent upon third party providers to develop the hardware platforms and operating systems on which our applications run 
development and marketing of our offerings depends on strategic relationships with other companies 
our existing strategic relationships may not endure and may not deliver the intended benefits  and we may not be able to enter into future strategic relationships 
since we do not possess all of the technical and marketing resources necessary to develop and market our offerings to their target markets  our business strategy substantially depends on our strategic relationships 
while some of these relationships are governed by contracts  most are non exclusive and all may be terminated on short notice by either party 
if these relationships terminate or fail to deliver the intended benefits  our development and marketing efforts will be impaired and our revenues may decline 
we may not be able to enter into new strategic relationships  which could put us at a disadvantage to those of our competitors which do successfully exploit strategic relationships 
our primary computer and telecommunications systems are in a limited number of geographic locations  which makes them more vulnerable to damage or interruption 
this damage or interruption could harm our business 
substantially all of our primary computer and telecommunications systems are located in two geographic areas 
these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  earthquake  water damage  sabotage  flood  power loss  technical or telecommunications failure or break ins 
our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for our lost business and will not compensate us for any liability we incur due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
although we have implemented network security measures  our systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
these disruptions could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to service our customers 
any of these occurrences could impair our ability to serve our customers and harm our business 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our applications 
our business exposes us to product liability risks 
any product liability or other claims brought against us  if successful and of sufficient magnitude  could negatively affect our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline 
our applications are highly complex and sophisticated and they may occasionally contain design defects or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
in addition  implementation of our applications may involve customer specific customization by us or third parties  and may involve integration with systems developed by third parties 
these aspects of our business create additional opportunities for errors and defects in our applications and services 
problems in the initial release may be discovered only after the application has been implemented and used over time with different computer systems and in a variety of other applications and environments 
our applications have in the past contained errors that were discovered after they were sold 
our customers have also occasionally experienced difficulties integrating our applications with other hardware or software in their enterprise 
we are not currently aware of any defects in our applications that might give rise to future lawsuits 
however  errors or integration problems may be discovered in the future 
such defects  errors or difficulties could result in loss of sales  delays in or elimination of market acceptance  damage to our brand or to our reputation  returns  increased costs and diversion of development resources  redesigns and increased warranty and servicing costs 
in addition  third party products  upon which our applications are dependent  may contain defects which could reduce or undermine entirely the performance of our applications 
our customers typically use our applications to perform mission critical functions 
as a result  the defects and problems discussed above could result in significant financial or other damage to our customers 
although our sales agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  we do not know if these limitations of liability are enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages to a customer resulting from a defect in one of our applications or the performance of our services 
our product liability insurance may not cover all claims brought against us 
softline limited owns or has the right to acquire a controlling percentage of our common stock  so we may be effectively controlled by softline and our other stockholders are unable to affect the outcome of stockholder voting 
softline limited beneficially owns of our outstanding common stock  including shares softline has the right to acquire upon conversion of its series a convertible preferred stock 
ivan m 
epstein  softline s chief executive officer  and rob wilkie  softline s chief financial officer  serve on our board of directors 
if softline converts its series a preferred stock  it may have effective control over all matters affecting us  including o the election of all of our directors  o the allocation of business opportunities that may be suitable for softline and us  o any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations involving us  o the acquisition or disposition of assets or businesses by us  o debt and equity financing  including future issuance of our common stock or other securities  o amendments to our charter documents  o the payment of dividends on our common stock  and o determinations with respect to our tax returns 
our business may be disadvantaged or harmed if softline s interests receive priority over our interests 
conflicts of interest have and will continue to arise between softline and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships 
conflicts may not be resolved in a manner that is favorable to us  and such conflicts may result in harmful consequences to our business or prospects 
softline s influence on our company could make it difficult for another company to acquire us  which could depress our stock price 
softline s potential voting control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger  takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or our stockholders 
as a result  softline s control could reduce the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our stock  or could prevent any party from attempting to acquire us at any price 
our stock price has been highly volatile  and has recently declined 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
when we or our competitors announce new customer orders or services  change pricing policies  experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results  announce strategic relationships or acquisitions  change earnings estimates  experience government regulatory actions or suffer from generally adverse economic conditions  our stock price could be affected 
some of the volatility in our stock price may be unrelated to our performance 
recently  companies similar to ours have experienced extreme price fluctuations  often for reasons unrelated to their performance 
for further information on our stock price trends  see market for company s common equity and related stockholder matters above 
we have never paid a dividend on our common stock and we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have not previously paid any cash or other dividend on our common stock 
we anticipate that we will use our earnings and cash flow for repayment of indebtedness  to support our operations  and for future growth  and we do not have any plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
our agreement with union bank prohibits us from paying dividends  and softline is entitled to dividends on its series a convertible preferred stock in preference and priority to common stockholders 
future equity financing s may further restrict our ability to pay dividends 
the terms of our preferred stock may reduce the value of your common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
we issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock to softline in may our board of directors may determine the terms of subsequent series of preferred stock without further action by our stockholders 
if we issue additional preferred stock  it could affect your rights or reduce the value of your common stock 
in particular  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party 
these terms may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion and redemption rights  and sinking fund provisions 
we are actively seeking capital  and some of the arrangements we are considering may involve the issuance of preferred stock 
failure to comply with the american stock exchange s listing standards could result in our delisting from that exchange and limit the ability to sell any of our common stock 
our stock is currently traded on the american stock exchange 
the exchange has published certain guidelines it uses in determining whether a security warrants continued listing 
these guidelines include financial  market capitalization and other criteria  and as a result of our financial condition or other factors  the exchange could in the future determine that our stock does not merit continued listing 
if our stock were delisted from the american stock exchange  the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock could become limited  and we would lose the advantage of some state and federal securities regulations imposing lower regulatory burdens on exchange traded issuers 
delaware law and some provisions of our charter and bylaws may adversely affect the price of your stock 
special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board  the chief executive officer or the board of directors 
stockholders have no right to call a meeting and may not act by written consent 
stockholders must also comply with advance notice provisions in our bylaws in order to nominate directors or propose matters for stockholder action 
these provisions of our charter documents  as well as certain provisions of delaware law  could delay or make more difficult certain types of transactions involving a change in control of the company or our management 
delaware law also contains provisions that could delay or make more difficult change in control transactions 
as a result  the price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
shares issued upon the exercise of options and warrants could dilute your stock holdings and adversely affect our stock price 
we have issued options and warrants to acquire common stock to our employees and certain other persons at various prices  some of which are or may in the future be below the market price of our stock 
if exercised in the money  these options and warrants will cause immediate and possibly substantial dilution to our stockholders 
we currently have all of the outstanding options and warrants for  million shares at prices above the recent market price of per share  and if the current market price increases  these options and warrants could have a dilutive effect on stockholders if exercised 
our existing stock option plan currently has approximately  shares available for issuance 
future options issued under the plan may have further dilutive effects 
sales of shares pursuant to exercisable options and warrants could lead to subsequent sales of the shares in the public market  and could depress the market price of our stock by creating an excess in supply of shares for sale 
issuance of these shares and sale of these shares in the public market could also impair our ability to raise capital by selling equity securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rate as measured against the us dollar 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variable rate term loans  which totaled million at march  based on this balance  a change in one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  or less than per basic and diluted share  on an annual basis 
these instruments were not entered into for trading purposes and carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from the bank s prime interest rate 
our objective in maintaining these variable rate borrowings is the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe and until february  australia 
sales are typically denominated in the local foreign currency  which creates exposures to changes in exchange rates 
these changes in the foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar may positively or negatively affect our sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
we attempt to minimize currency exposure risk through decentralized sales  development  marketing and support operations  in which substantially all costs are local currency based 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the foreign currency 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risk 
approximately   and of our total net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the periods ended march   and  respectively 
equity price risk we have no direct equity investments
