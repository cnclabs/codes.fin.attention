critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
as discussed under restructuring  asset impairments and the year over year comparisons below  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company has reviewed these policies with its audit committee 
revenues revenues from product sales and software licenses are recorded upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
customer acceptance provisions include final testing and acceptance carried out prior to shipment 
these pre shipment testing and acceptance procedures ensure that the product meets the published specification requirements before the product is shipped 
shipping terms are customarily fob shipping point 
when significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present in the arrangement  revenue is generally recognized upon completion of customer technical acceptance testing 
the company enters into two types of significant multi element arrangements tailored software arrangements  described below  and software sales with post contract support 
revenues from fixed fee tailored software consulting contracts and long term contracts are recognized using one of two methods a the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  based on the ratio that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs at completion  or b the completed contract method where appropriate for complex systems integration projects 
when using the percentage of completion method  revisions in revenue and cost estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that require such revisions become known and losses  if any  are provided for in the period in which such losses are first identified by management 
for tailored software contracts  the company provides significant consulting services to tailor the software to the customer s environment 
the company utilizes the percentage of completion method due to the significance of the service effort 
if the ability of the company to complete the tailored software is uncertain  completed contract accounting is applied 
revenue recognition involves judgments and assessments of expected returns  the likelihood of nonpayment and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts 
the company analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 

table of contents intangible assets and goodwill the company has made a number of acquisitions  and as a result  identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill 
intangible assets are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that the company expects to generate from their use 
if the company s expectations of future results and cash flows change and are significantly diminished  intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company measures impairment based on one of two methods 
for assets related to ongoing operations the company plans to continue  the company uses a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measures impairment using discounted cash flows 
for assets to be disposed of  the company assesses the fair value of the asset based on current market condition for similar assets 
for goodwill  the company assesses fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of its reporting units and measures impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value 
the estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require the company to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of the company s control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or economic conditions were to further deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  with a resulting charge to results of operations 
warranty the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and may result in additional charges to results of operations 
inventory the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the company fully reserves for inventories deemed obsolete 
the company performs periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through its planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the 
table of contents company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
restructuring the company s business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and oem s  which are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
the company s revenues grew substantially in fiscal and the first half of fiscal  due in large part to high levels of capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
the semiconductor industry is currently experiencing such a downturn  which began to impact the company in the third quarter of fiscal and has continued throughout fiscal the downturn has affected revenues  gross margins and operating results 
in response to this prolonged and continuing downturn  the company has initiated  and continues to implement  cost reduction programs aimed at aligning its ongoing operating costs with its currently expected revenues over the near term 
these cost management initiatives have included consolidating facilities  reductions to headcount  salary and wage reductions and reduced spending 
although the company continues to address cost management in response to the downturn  it will continue to invest in those areas which it believes are important to the long term growth of the company  including customer support and new products 
it is critical that the company executes restructure actions in a timely basis to achieve the objective of aligning its cost structure 
see company may have difficulty managing operations below for additional discussion of the challenges the company faces in implementing its restructuring programs 
fiscal restructuring based on current estimates of its near term future revenues and operating costs  the company announced in december plans to take additional and significant cost reduction actions 
these cost reduction programs include  among other things an additional reduction of approximately employees  a reduction of new hires  consolidation of identified facilities  abandonment of certain information technology projects and an exit from certain product lines 
a portion of these actions have been implemented in the first quarter of fiscal the company will record charges of million with respect to these activities in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  the company will record a charge of approximately million for accelerated depreciation associated with facilities closed and related fixed assets following the september  announcements 
the company will also incur charges totalling approximately million associated with accelerated depreciation related to facility closures announced in the december restructuring  expected to be completed over the next six months 
the company believes that the cost reduction programs will be implemented and executed on a timely basis and will align costs with revenues 
in the event that the company is unable to achieve this alignment  additional cost cutting programs may be required in the future 
fiscal restructuring on september   the company s chief executive officer approved a formal plan of restructure in response to the ongoing downturn in the semiconductor industry  which continues to exert downward pressure on the company s revenues and cost structure 
to that effect  the company recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
of this amount  million is related to workforce reductions of approximately employees  and is expected to be paid in fiscal  million is for the consolidation of several of the company s facilities and million is for other restructuring costs 
workforce related charges  consisting principally of severance costs  were recorded based on specific identification of employees to be terminated  along with their job classifications or functions and their locations 
the charges for the company s excess facilities were recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 
these costs have been estimated from the time when the space is expected to be vacated and there are no plans to utilize the facility in the future 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities are being charged to operations 

table of contents as part of the plan to integrate the pri acquisition  certain sales  technical support and administrative functions were combined and headcount and related costs reduced 
accordingly  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded million of restructuring charges  comprised of million for workforce reduction related costs for existing brooks employees  million related to excess existing brooks facilities and million of other restructuring costs 
the million for the company s excess facilities was recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 
these costs have been estimated from the time these facilities are expected to be vacated and there are no plans to utilize the facility in the future 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities are being charged to operations 
restructuring costs of million for former pri employees  million for pri facilities and million for other costs were accrued as part of the purchase accounting for the pri acquisition  relating to the consolidation and elimination of certain pri duplicate facilities and redundant pri personnel 
the company anticipated headcount reductions of approximately people across all functional areas of the combined company and  as such  included an estimated accrual for workforce reductions of million comprised of severance  employee benefits and outplacement support 
as of september   of these employees had been terminated  and million of severance and other workforce related costs had been paid 
the former chief executive officer of pri has entered into a non competition agreement with the company  which became effective upon completion of the combination and which will require a total payment of million over a two year period  of which million was recorded as a long term liability 
the company has identified redundant facilities consisting of sales and support offices  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
accordingly  an accrual of million to terminate lease obligations under these agreements was provided 
these payments represent the fair value of the minimum rental commitment on facilities with lease terms to the company accrued for million of amounts to be incurred subsequent to the acquisition related to legal costs to close subsidiaries of pri 
fiscal restructuring on september   the company s board of directors approved a formal plan of restructure in response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
to that effect  the company recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
of this amount  million was related to workforce reductions of approximately employees  which was paid in fiscal  and million was for the consolidation and strategic focus realignment of several facilities  of which million was paid through fiscal  million is expected to be paid in fiscal and million in the subsequent years 
workforce charges  consisting principally of severance costs  were recorded based on specific identification of employees to be terminated  along with their job classifications or functions and their locations 
the charges for the company s excess facilities were recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 
these costs were estimated from the time the space was expected to be vacated and there are no plans to utilize the facility in the future 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities are being charged to operations 
periodically  the accruals related to the acquisition related and restructuring charges are reviewed and compared to their respective cash requirements 
as a result of those reviews  the accruals are adjusted for changes in cost and timing assumptions of previously approved and recorded initiatives 
during the year ended september   the company identified excess workforce related accruals recorded for earlier initiatives of million  which were reversed on september  
table of contents the activity related to the company s restructuring accruals described above is summarized below in thousands fiscal activity new initiatives balance balance september  purchase september  expense accounting reversals utilization facilities workforce related other fiscal activity new initiatives balance balance september  purchase september  expense accounting reversals utilization facilities workforce related other given the severity of current market conditions  and the possibility of further declines in revenue beyond what is forecast  however  the company cannot guarantee that these cost reduction programs will be sufficient to align the company s operating expenses with revenues or be sufficient to avoid operating losses  or that additional cost reduction programs will not be necessary in the future 
asset impairments the prolonged and continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry has negatively impacted the company s segments 
as in past downturns  the company is experiencing diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of selling prices 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s revenues  which included a full quarter of contribution from pri approximating million  decreased to approximately million 
at present  the company cannot predict the duration or severity of this downturn  but based on the current bookings trends  the company expects fiscal revenue to decrease  compared to fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began the preparation of its fiscal plan and reviewed its internal forecasts and external data 
the external data available from customer and competitor commentary  as well as industry forecasts of future revenue growth  indicated that the timing and speed of recovery for the sector would be later and slower than previously anticipated 
as a result of the declining financial performance in the company s segments and resulting reduced expectations for future revenues and earnings  management performed an assessment of the carrying values of long lived assets within each of its segments 
the company performed an assessment of the carrying values of its intangible assets as proscribed by financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas 
the impairment testing was based on undiscounted cash flows to determine if an impairment existed 
the resulting impairments were measured utilizing discounted cash flow analyses of expectations of future earnings related to existing long lived assets for each of the reporting units over the remaining estimated useful lives of the primary assets of the reporting unit 
this assessment resulted in the impairment of intangible assets in each of the company s segments 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge to operations of million for the write down of intangible assets 
this charge is included within amortization of acquired intangible assets and asset impairment charges in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september  
table of contents the company elected to early adopt the provisions of fas effective october  accordingly  the company ceased the ratable amortization of goodwill on that date 
the company was required to complete the first step of the transitional impairment testing of goodwill as of the date of adoption under the provisions of fas by march  the company completed its initial testing as required and determined that there was no impairment as of october  in addition to the impairment indicators noted for intangible assets  the company was also required to perform the annual impairment test of its goodwill under the provisions of fas  as of september  the company compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its recorded book value 
an excess of book value over fair value indicates that an impairment of goodwill exists 
the fair value of goodwill is determined on an implied residual basis by deducting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including non acquired intangible assets not recorded  from the total fair value of the reporting unit 
impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the recorded value of goodwill over the implied residual value 
the impairment testing was based on discounted cash flow analyses of expectations of future earnings for each of the reporting units over the remaining estimated lives of the primary assets of the reporting unit 
during this annual impairment test  and primarily as a result of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry and uncertainty as to the timing and speed of recovery for the sector  the company concluded that goodwill related to its equipment automation  factory automation hardware and factory automation software segments was impaired 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge to operations of million for the write down of goodwill 
the write down of goodwill is included within amortization of acquired intangible assets and asset impairment charges in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september  year ended september   compared to year ended september  the company reported a net loss of million in the year ended september   compared to a net loss of million in the previous year 
the results for the year ended september  include charges of million for the ratable amortization of acquired intangible assets  million for the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and million for the impairment of goodwill associated with the company s acquisitions  million for the write down of the value of the company s net deferred tax asset  million of restructuring and acquisition related charges and million of other charges 
these other charges include million recorded to cost of product revenues  million recorded to research and development expense and million recorded to selling  general and administrative expense 
the charge to cost of product revenues is comprised of million for valuation adjustments to inventories  million for additional warranty reserves  million for loss reserves on acquired contracts  million for the write down of an obsolete tool used in the company s manufacturing process and million for deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies 
the charge to research and development represents deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies 
the charge to selling  general and administrative expense is comprised of million for deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies and million of executive severance accruals 
the results for the year ended september   included million of charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  million of restructuring and acquisition related charges and million of other charges 
these other charges  recorded in the fourth quarter  include million recorded to cost of product revenues  comprised of million for valuation adjustments to inventories and million for additional warranty reserves  million of accelerated amortization of research and development expense and million of sales  general and administrative expense for additional accounts receivable allowances 
because of the significant decline in revenues in fiscal  and the fourth quarter expectation of a continuation of depressed demand in the first half of fiscal  the company projected additional shortfalls in the expected usage of certain inventories and recorded the resulting charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal the reserves for excess and obsolete inventories included million and million in fiscal and 
table of contents  respectively  for non cancelable purchase order obligations for items deemed excess or obsolete 
the inventory affected was across several hardware product lines in the equipment automation and factory automation hardware segments 
during this process  the company reviewed all open purchase orders with the affected vendors across the various segments of the company and canceled orders where possible 
the company had provided million in the first three quarters of both fiscal and  as a result of the periodic reviews of obsolete and excess inventory performed by the company 
during fiscal  the company experienced a continued deterioration across both its end user and oem customer base in its receivable aging and a resultant increase in its day sales outstanding  driven by the overall slowdown in the industry 
the company increased its reserves in fiscal against receivables due to collection issues caused by the slowdown 
during fiscal  the company increased its emphasis on collection efforts  including higher staffing levels for collections  which resulted in a decrease in its day sales outstanding at september  accordingly  no additional increase to reserves was required 
revenues the company reported revenues of million for the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  a decrease 
the decrease in revenues is principally attributable to the downturn that continues to impact the semiconductor industry  partially offset by approximately million of incremental revenue from acquisitions consummated during fiscal the company s net revenues  excluding the impact of these acquisitions  decreased in the year ended september   compared to the prior year 
the company s equipment automation segment reported revenues of million in the year ended september   a decrease of from the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry  partially offset by approximately million of incremental revenues from fiscal acquisitions 
these incremental revenues were primarily generated by the pri businesses acquired 
excluding these incremental revenues  the segment s revenues declined from the prior year 
the company s factory automation hardware segment reported a increase  to million  in the year ended september   compared to the previous year 
the increase is attributable to acquisitions completed during fiscal  which contributed approximately million to the segment s revenues 
excluding this incremental revenue  the segment s revenues declined from the prior year 
the company s factory automation software segment reported revenues of million  a decrease of from the prior year 
the decrease resulting from the downturn in the semiconductor industry was partially offset by approximately million of incremental revenues from fiscal acquisitions 
these incremental software revenues were principally generated by the pri businesses acquired 
excluding these incremental revenues  the segment s revenues declined  compared to the prior year 
product revenues decreased million  or  to million  in the year ended september   from million in the previous fiscal year 
this decrease is attributable to the continuing slowdown in the semiconductor industry  which began to impact the company during the second half of fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions consummated during fiscal  product revenues decreased 
service revenues increased million  or  to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the company s fiscal acquisitions 
excluding the impact of acquisitions consummated during fiscal  service revenues decreased revenues outside the united states were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in the years ended september  and  respectively 
the company expects that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues 
the current international component of revenues is not indicative of future international revenues 
gross margin gross margin decreased to for the year ended september   compared to for the previous year 
excluding other charges detailed above of million and million in the years ended september  and  respectively  gross margins were and  respectively 
the decrease is 
table of contents primarily attributable to lower revenue levels which are a result of the downturn which continues to affect the semiconductor industry  coupled with the historically lower margin rates of several of the company s fiscal acquisitions 
lower revenue levels impact cost absorption due to excess manufacturing capacity exerting downward pressure on gross margins 
the company s equipment automation segment gross margin decreased to in the year ended september   from in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily the result of product and customer mix  coupled with the effects of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry and the resultant impact of excess manufacturing capacity and lower margin rates of the company s recently acquired businesses 
gross margin for the company s factory automation hardware segment decreased to in the year ended september   from in the prior year 
the decrease is the result of the acquisition of lower margin hardware businesses  coupled with reduced volume within existing business  which led to absorption variances 
the company s factory automation software segment s gross margin for the year ended september   decreased to  compared to in the prior year 
the change is primarily due to unfavorable product mix shifts between license and service revenues 
gross margin on product revenues was for the year ended september   compared to for the prior year 
excluding other charges aggregating million  gross margin on product revenues was for the year ended september  excluding other charges aggregating million  gross margin on product revenues was for the year ended september  the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to the effects of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry  causing lower absorption of manufacturing fixed costs 
gross margin on service revenues decreased to for the year ended september   from in the previous year 
the decrease is primarily a result of a change in business mix  combined with the pricing pressure of the end user services business and the effects of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry on the company s fixed cost absorption 
the company performs cycle and year end inventory counts 
as a result of these counts  the company recorded adjustments of million and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of its inventories 
included in the process of the physical count is the review of the useful life and expected benefits of utilizing demonstration equipment inventory 
as a result of this review  the company recorded an adjustment of million for excess and idle demonstration equipment inventory in fiscal there was no charge for demonstration equipment arising in fiscal the company accrues for warranty obligations related to its hardware products 
due to increased warranty return repair costs during the second half of the fiscal year and fiscal year of certain products under warranty  the company determined that additional warranty reserves of million and million were required and recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal and  respectively 
the company capitalized certain costs related to in house software development during the first half of fiscal consistent with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed for internal use sop 
consistent with sop  the company performed a review at fiscal year end of the projects for which the company capitalized costs 
based upon this review  the company determined that the related projects  particularly in considering the industry slowdown in the second half of the year and the expected continuing slowdown  no longer provided the company with incremental and substantial benefit and cancelled the projects 
as a result  million of capitalized costs were expensed in the year ended september  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended september   were million  an increase of million  compared to million in the previous year 
research and development expenses also increased as a percentage of revenues  to  from in the prior year

this increase is primarily attributable to growth in the vacuum business area earlier in fiscal  partially offset by lower revenues in the last two quarters of fiscal the company s factory automation hardware segment reported an increase of  to million in the year ended september   compared to the prior year  reflecting in part the strong growth in the company s standard mechanical interface facilities smif and front opening uniform pod foup product lines  partially offset by lower revenues at pti 
the company s fiscal acquisitions did not materially affect either its equipment automation segment or its factory automation hardware segment 
the company s factory automation software segment reported revenues of million in the year ended september   an increase of from the prior year  principally due to internal growth  the acquisition of asc and asi on january  and the acquisition of semy on february  
table of contents product revenues increased million  to million  in the year ended september   from million in the previous fiscal year 
this growth is directly attributable to the company s recent acquisitions 
excluding acquisitions  combined product revenues remained flat from fiscal to fiscal  due primarily to the slowdown in the semiconductor industry in the second half of fiscal service revenues increased million  or  to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to internal growth  the acquisition of asc and asi on january   which accounted for approximately million of the increase in service revenues over fiscal year  and increased spare parts sales to both end user and oem customers 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in the years ended september  and  respectively 
the absolute increase in revenues outside the united states is primarily the result of the company s expanded global presence from its recent acquisitions  while the increase as a percentage of the company s revenues reflects lower sales in the united states  in particular oem sales in the second half of fiscal  relative to the rest of the world 
gross margin gross margin decreased to for the year ended september   compared to for the previous year 
excluding other charges of million referred to above  the company s gross margin was for the year ended september  this change is primarily a result of increased services revenues  where margins are higher  related to end user sales combined with lower software product revenues and increased unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
the company s equipment automation segment gross margin decreased to in the year ended september   from in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily the result of product and customer mix  coupled with the effects of the current downturn in the semiconductor industry and the resultant impact of excess manufacturing capacity 
gross margin for the company s factory automation hardware segment was in the year ended september   a decrease from in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to inefficiencies for new products  combined with excess manufacturing capacity resulting from the current downturn in the semiconductor industry 
the company s factory automation software segment gross margin for the year ended september   decreased to  from in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to product and services mix  specifically  a decrease in higher margin software product license revenues  partially offset by increased lower margin service revenues 
gross margin on product revenues was for the year ended september   compared to for the prior year 
excluding other charges aggregating million  gross margin on product revenues was for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower software license product revenues and increased field support personnel associated with end user projects  coupled with the effects of the current downturn in the semiconductor industry  which impact pricing and cause lower absorption of manufacturing fixed costs 
gross margin on service revenues decreased to for the year ended september   from in the previous year 
the decrease is primarily a result of business mix  combined with the pricing pressure of the end user services business and the effects of the current downturn in the semiconductor industry on the company s fixed cost absorption

interest income and expense interest income increased by million  to million  in the year ended september   compared to an increase of million to million the previous year 
this increase is due primarily to higher cash and investment asset balances which resulted from investing the proceeds from the company s private placement of million aggregate convertible subordinated notes in may and the public offering of shares of its common stock in march interest expense of million for the year ended september   relates primarily to the convertible subordinated notes  imputed interest on notes payable related to the e diagnostics and simcon acquisitions and the company s note payable to daifuku america in connection with the acquisition of asc and asi  which was settled on january  interest expense in the prior year primarily relates to irvine optical s debt  which was paid by brooks subsequent to the company s acquisition of irvine optical  and the note payable to daifuku america 
income tax provision benefit the company recorded a net income tax benefit of million in the year ended september  and net income tax expense of million in the year ended september  the tax benefit recorded in fiscal is primarily due to anticipated future tax benefit of domestic net operating losses and research and development credits  partially offset by provisions for taxes on overseas earnings 
the fiscal tax provision is attributable to federal  state  foreign and withholding taxes 
federal and state taxes have been reduced for net operating losses  research and development tax credits and a foreign sales corporation benefit 
liquidity and capital resources the company has recorded significant losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit of million at september  revenues and operations have decreased substantially and net cash outflows from operations have increased significantly as a result of acquisitions and the current downturn within the semiconductor sector and related industries 
consequently  the company has undertaken several restructuring programs during the year ended september   to align its cost structures and its revenues 

table of contents due to the severity of and the continuation of the downturn  the company announced in december further cost reductions to be implemented during the course of fiscal the cyclical nature of the industry  the extended period of the current downturn and the current uncertainty as to the timing and speed of recovery mean that estimates of future revenues  results of revenues  results of operations and net cash flows are inherently difficult 
at september   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
at september   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
the company issued million shares during fiscal  valued at million  based on the average closing price of the company s stock for two days before  the day of and two days after the announcement of each transaction  as purchase consideration in the acquisitions of hermos  pri  ias  tec sem and gpi 
the company expects to issue an additional  shares to the selling stockholders of hermos upon the satisfaction of certain contingencies 
this additional consideration will generate additional goodwill of approximately million  based on the price of the company s common stock at september   which may be part of a goodwill impairment charge during fiscal cash and cash equivalents were million at september   a decrease of million from september  this decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to cash used in operations of million  capital expenditures of million and million for the cash consideration element of acquisitions in the year 
these amounts were partially offset by million of net sales and maturities of marketable securities  million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and cash acquired totaling million  primarily from the pri acquisition 
cash used in operations was million for the year ended september   and is primarily attributable to the company s net loss of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization of million  a charge for the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill totaling million  net changes to the company s net deferred tax asset aggregating million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the company s days sales outstanding dso decreased to days at september   from days at september  the improvement is primarily attributable to the company s increased emphasis on collection efforts  including higher staffing levels for collections

in connection with its acquisition of simcon  the company had issued a note payable to the selling stockholders for  payable in one year 
this note was settled with  shares of the company s common stock on may  on may   the company completed the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in interest on the notes is paid on june and december of each year 
the company made its first interest payment on december  the notes will mature on june  the company may redeem the notes at stated premiums on or after june   or earlier if the price of the company s common stock reaches certain prices 
holders may require the company to repurchase the notes upon a change in control of the company in certain circumstances 
the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity  at the option of the holders  into shares of the company s common stock  at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the notes are subordinated to the company s senior indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the company s subsidiaries 
while the company has no significant capital commitments  the company anticipates that it will continue to make capital expenditures to support its business 
the company may also use its resources to acquire companies  technologies or products that complement the business of the company 
the company had a million uncommitted demand promissory note facility with abn amro bank nv abn amro  which expired on may  accordingly  abn amro will not extend loans or issue additional letters of credit

the projected amount payable is due immediately upon his retirement  however  his retirement date is not determinable at this time 
his current employment agreement will expire on october  the company believes that its existing resources will be adequate to fund the company s currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company used million to fund its operations in fiscal  and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it very difficult for the company to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
accordingly  over the longer term it is important that the restructuring programs described above succeed in aligning costs with revenues 
in addition  the company may experience unforeseen capital needs in connection with its recently completed acquisitions 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  the company may need to raise additional funds to develop new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions

risk factors relating to the company s industry the cyclical demand of semiconductor manufacturers affects the company s operating results and the ongoing downturn in the industry could seriously harm the company s operating results 
the company s business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
the level of semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditures is dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is currently experiencing a downturn 
the downturn may continue for several more quarters 
as a result of cost reductions in response to the decrease in net sales and uncertainty over the timing and extent of any industry recovery  the company may be unable to continue to invest in marketing  research and development and engineering at the 
table of contents levels the company believes are necessary to maintain its competitive position 
the company s failure to make these investments could seriously curtail its long term business prospects 
consistent with its experience in past downturns  the current industry downturn has reduced the company s revenues and caused it to incur losses 
there can be no guarantee of when this downturn will end or that the company will return to profitability when the downturn does end 
industry consolidation and outsourcing of the manufacture of semiconductors to foundries could reduce the number of available customers 
the substantial expense of building or expanding a semiconductor fabrication facility is leading increasing numbers of semiconductor companies to contract with foundries  which manufacture semiconductors designed by others 
as manufacturing is shifted to foundries  the number of the company s potential customers could decrease  which would increase its dependence on its remaining customers 
recently  consolidation within the semiconductor manufacturing industry has increased 
if semiconductor manufacturing is consolidated into a small number of foundries and other large companies  the company s failure to win any significant bid to supply equipment to those customers could seriously harm its reputation and materially and adversely affect its revenue and operating results 
the company s future operations could be harmed if the commercial adoption of mm wafer technology continues to progress slowly or is halted 
the company s future operations depend in part on the adoption of new systems and technologies to automate the processing of mm wafers 
however  the industry transition from the current  widely used mm manufacturing technology to mm manufacturing technology is occurring more slowly than originally expected 
a significant delay in the adoption of mm manufacturing technology  or the failure of the industry to adopt mm manufacturing technology  could significantly impair the company s operations 
moreover  continued delay in transition to mm technology could permit the company s competitors to introduce competing or superior mm products at more competitive prices 
as a result of these factors  competition for mm orders could become vigorous and could harm the company s results of operations 
the merger of pri into brooks on may  does not reduce this risk 
manufacturers implementing factory automation in mm pilot projects typically seek to purchase systems from multiple vendors 
automated material handling systems are a major component of the former pri s business 
to date  nearly all manufacturers with pilot projects have selected automated material handling systems made by competitors for these projects 
manufacturers awards to these competitors of orders for early stage mm fabs could make it more difficult for the company to win orders from those manufacturers for their full scale mm production facilities 
pri s difficulties with production of the turbostocker product could adversely affect the company s ability to compete in the mm wafer technology marketplace 
during fiscal and  prior to its acquisition by brooks  pri encountered manufacturing and supply chain problems related to its turbostocker product  which pri had planned to begin manufacturing in high volume in response to increased customer demand at that time 
these problems caused delays in shipments and in customer acceptance of these systems  and in some cases required repair or retrofit of turbostockers already installed in the field 
these manufacturing problems may have undermined potential mm customers confidence in pri s ability to manufacture and deliver complex factory automation systems in a timely manner and at acceptable quality levels 
that loss of confidence could continue to adversely affect the competitive position of the company in the market for that particular product and possibly also for other mm products 

table of contents risk factors relating to the company s acquisitions the company s business could be harmed if the company fails to adequately integrate the operations of the businesses it has acquired 
over the past several years  the company has completed a number of acquisitions in a relatively short period of time  including the acquisition of pri in may the company s management must devote substantial time and resources to the integration of the operations of its acquired businesses with its core business and its other acquired businesses 
if the company fails to accomplish this integration efficiently  the company may not realize the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions 
the company was required to record impairment charges on acquired intangible assets and goodwill aggregating million in fiscal the company may be required in the future to record additional significant future impairment costs in the event that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of acquired intangible assets 
the process of integrating supply and distribution channels  research and development initiatives  computer and accounting systems and other aspects of the operation of its acquired businesses  presents a significant challenge to the company s management 
this is compounded by the challenge of simultaneously managing a larger entity 
these businesses have operations and personnel located in asia  europe and the united states and present a number of difficulties of integration  including assimilating products and designs into integrated solutions  informing customers  suppliers and distributors of the effects of the acquisitions and integrating them into the company s overall operations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and cultures  defining and executing a comprehensive product strategy  managing geographically remote units  managing the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which the company has limited or no direct experience  and minimizing the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 
if the company delays the integration or fails to integrate an acquired business or experiences other unforeseen difficulties  the integration process may require a disproportionate amount of the company s management s attention and financial and other resources 
the company s failure to adequately address these difficulties could harm its business and financial results 
the company s business may be harmed by acquisitions the company completes in the future 
while the company does not anticipate any significant additional acquisitions while the current economic downturn continues  it may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of related businesses 
the company s identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the values  strengths  weaknesses  risks and profitability of acquisition candidates  including the effects of the possible acquisition on the company s business  diversion of the company s management s attention and risks associated with unanticipated problems or latent liabilities 
if the company is successful in pursuing future acquisitions  the company may be required to expend significant funds  incur additional debt or issue additional securities  which may negatively affect the company s results of operations and be dilutive to its stockholders 
if the company spends significant funds or incurs additional debt  the company s ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline  and the company may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that it will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that it completes 
should the company successfully acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into the company s existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of the company s existing business 

table of contents risk factors relating to the company s operations the company s sales volume substantially depends on the sales volume of the company s original equipment manufacturer customers and on investment in major capital expansion programs by end user semiconductor manufacturing companies 
the company sells a majority of its tool automation products to original equipment manufacturers that incorporate the company s products into their equipment 
therefore  the company s revenues depend on the ability of these customers to develop  market and sell their equipment in a timely  cost effective manner 
approximately and of the company s total revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  came from sales to original equipment manufacturers 
the company also generates significant revenues from large orders from semiconductor manufacturing companies that build new plants or invest in major automation retrofits 
the company s revenues depend  in part  on continued capital investment by semiconductor manufacturing companies 
approximately and of the company s total revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  came from sales to semiconductor manufacturing companies 
the percentage of the company s total revenue attributable to semiconductor manufacturing companies should rise in fiscal as a result of the pri acquisition 
the company s revenues will be adversely affected if semiconductor manufacturing companies do not invest in capital expansion programs due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry or for other reasons 
demand for the company s products fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably  which makes it difficult to manage its business efficiently and can reduce its gross margins and profitability 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations for future demand 
many expenses  particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead  are relatively fixed 
the rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for the company s products make it difficult to plan manufacturing capacity and business operations efficiently 
if demand is significantly below expectations  the company may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs  which can diminish gross margins and cause losses 
a sudden downturn may also leave the company with excess inventory  which may be rendered obsolete as products evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products 
for example  as a result of the current industry downturn  the company recorded inventory adjustments of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal relating to inventory writedowns 
the company s ability to reduce expenses is further constrained because it must continue to invest in research and development to maintain its competitive position and to maintain service and support for its existing global customer base 
conversely  during periods of increased demand the company s ability to satisfy increased customer demand may be constrained by its projections 
if the company s projections underestimate demand  the company may have inadequate inventory and may not be able to expand its manufacturing capacity  which could result in delays in shipments and loss of customers and reduced gross margins and profitability 
in sudden upturns  the company sometimes incurs significant expenses to rapidly expedite delivery of components  procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes 
this risk is more acute in fiscal as the company consolidates several of its manufacturing locations  making its manufacturing capabilities more vulnerable to sudden demands for production 
even if the company is able to sufficiently expand its capacity  the company may not efficiently manage this expansion which would adversely affect the company s gross margin and profitability 
any of these results could seriously harm the company s business 
the company relies on a relatively limited number of customers for a large portion of its revenues and business 
the company receives a significant portion of its revenues in each fiscal period from a relatively limited number of customers 
the loss of one or more of these major customers  or a decrease in orders by one or more customers  could adversely affect the company s revenue  business and reputation 
in addition  the company s customers have in the past sought price concessions from it and may continue to do so in the future  particularly during downturns in the semiconductor market  which could reduce the company s 
table of contents profitability and gross margins 
the company s sales to its ten largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal delays in or cancellation of shipments or customer acceptance of a few of the company s large orders could substantially decrease its revenues or reduce its stock price 
historically  a substantial portion of the company s quarterly and annual revenues came from sales of a small number of large orders 
some of the company s products have high selling prices compared to the company s other products 
as a result  the timing of when the company recognizes revenue from one of these large orders can have a significant impact on its total revenues and operating results for a particular period because its sales in that fiscal period could fall significantly below the expectations of financial analysts and investors 
this could cause the value of its common stock to fall 
the company s operating results could be harmed if a small number of large orders are canceled or rescheduled by customers or cannot be filled due to delays in manufacturing  testing  shipping or product acceptance 
the company does not have long term contracts with its customers and the company s customers may cease purchasing the company s products at any time 
the company generally does not have long term contracts with its customers 
as a result  the company s agreements with its customers do not provide any assurance of future sales 
accordingly the company s customers can cease purchasing its products at any time without penalty  the company s customers are free to purchase products from the company s competitors  the company is exposed to competitive price pressure on each order  and the company s customers are not required to make minimum purchases 
sales typically are made pursuant to individual purchase orders and product delivery often occurs with extremely short lead times 
if the company is unable to fulfill these orders in a timely manner  the company could lose sales and customers 
the company s systems integration services business has grown significantly recently and poor execution of those services could adversely impact the company s operating results 
the number of projects the company is pursuing for its systems integration services business has grown significantly recently 
this business consists of integrating combinations of the company software and hardware products to provide more comprehensive solutions for the company s end user customers 
the delivery of these services typically is complex  requiring that the company coordinate personnel with varying technical backgrounds in performing substantial amounts of services in accordance with timetables 
the company is in the early stages of developing this business and it is subject to the risks attendant to entering a business in which it has limited direct experience 
in addition  the company s ability to supply these services and increase its revenues is limited by its ability to retain  hire and train systems integration personnel 
the company believes that there is significant competition for personnel with the advanced skills and technical knowledge that it needs 
some of the company s competitors may have greater resources to hire personnel with those skills and knowledge 
the company s operating margins could be adversely impacted if it does not effectively hire and train additional personnel or deliver systems integration services to its customers on a satisfactory and timely basis consistent with its budgets 
the company s lengthy sales cycle requires it to incur significant expenses with no assurance that it will generate revenue 
the company s tool automation products are generally incorporated into original equipment manufacturer equipment at the design stage 
to obtain new business from its original equipment manufacturer customers  the company must develop products for selection by a potential customer at the design stage 
this often requires it to make significant expenditures without any assurance of success 
the original equipment 
table of contents manufacturer s design decisions often precede the generation of volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
the company cannot guarantee that the equipment manufactured by its original equipment manufacturing customers will be commercially successful 
if the company or its original equipment manufacturing customers fails to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner  the company s business and financial results will suffer 
the company also must complete successfully a costly evaluation and proposal process before it can achieve volume sales of its factory automation hardware and software and systems integration products to customers 
these undertakings are major decisions for most prospective customers and typically involve significant capital commitments and lengthy evaluation and approval processes 
the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to satisfy evaluations by its end user customers 
the company s operating results would be harmed if one of its key suppliers fails to deliver components for the company s products 
the company currently obtains many of its components on an as needed  purchase order basis 
generally  the company does not have any long term supply contracts with its vendors and believes many of its vendors have been taking cost containment measures in response to the industry downturn 
when demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment increases  the company s suppliers face significant challenges in delivering components on a timely basis 
the company s inability to obtain components in required quantities or of acceptable quality could result in significant delays or reductions in product shipments 
this could create customer dissatisfaction  cause lost revenue and otherwise materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
delays on the company s part could also cause it to incur contractual penalties for late delivery 
as a result of the acquisition of pri  the company is becoming increasingly dependent on subcontractors and one or a few suppliers for some components and manufacturing processes 
for some products  or components or specialized processes that pri used in its products  pri depended on subcontractors or had available only one or a few suppliers 
for example  its turbostocker  aeroloader  aerotrak and guardian products each include components and assemblies for which pri had qualified  or for which there existed  only one supplier or a small number of suppliers 
as a result of the acquisition of pri  the company is dependent on these limited suppliers 
in general  the company does not have long term agreements with these suppliers  or agreements that obligate them to supply all of the company s requirements for such components or assemblies 
also  the company relies on shinsung engineering co 
ltd 
to manufacture its turbostocker product for delivery in the asian market and to provide related customer support 
the company has a master engineering services agreement with shinsung  which provides the general terms and conditions under which the company may from time to time request that shinsung perform engineering projects for the company 
the scope of each project and the related price and other terms are defined in separate statements of work to be agreed upon by the company and shinsung 
the agreement provides that all intellectual property created by shinsung in the course of any such project will belong to the company 
the company also has a master manufacturing services agreement with shinsung  which provides the general terms and conditions under which the company may from time to time request that shinsung manufacture products for the company 
the specifications for any products to be manufactured  and related price and other terms  are to be defined in one or more separate purchase orders to be issued by the company to shinsung 
these agreements with shinsung are non exclusive  contain customary provisions entitling either party to terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach of the agreement by  or the insolvency of  the other party  and also may be terminated by the company at any time for its convenience 
the agreements both expire in october the company s reliance on subcontractors gives the company less control over the manufacturing process and exposes it to significant risks  especially inadequate capacity  late delivery  substandard quality and high costs 
the company intends to outsource additional aspects of its manufacturing operations to subcontractors and suppliers 
the company could experience disruption in obtaining products or needed components and may be unable to develop alternatives in a timely manner 
if the company is unable to obtain 
table of contents adequate deliveries of products or components for an extended period of time  it may have to pay more for inventory  parts and other supplies  seek alternative sources of supply or delay shipping products to its customers 
these outcomes could damage the company s relationships with customers 
any such increased costs  delays in shipping or damage to customer relationships could seriously harm the company s business 
the company s dependence on third party suppliers could harm its ability to negotiate the terms of its future business relationships with these parties  and the company may be unable to replace any of them on terms favorable to it 
in addition  outsourcing the company s manufacturing to third parties may require the company to share its proprietary information with these suppliers 
although the company enters into confidentiality agreements with these third parties  these agreements may not adequately protect the company s proprietary information 
the company may experience delays and technical difficulties in new product introductions and manufacturing  which can adversely affect its revenues  gross margins and net income 
because the company s systems are complex  there can be a significant lag between the time it introduces a system and the time it begins to produce that system in volume 
as technology in the semiconductor industry becomes more sophisticated  the company is finding it increasingly difficult to design and integrate complex technologies into its systems  to procure adequate supplies of specialized components  to train its technical and manufacturing personnel and to make timely transitions to high volume manufacturing 
many customers also require customized systems  which compound these difficulties 
the company sometimes incurs substantial unanticipated costs to ensure that its new products function properly and reliably early in their life cycle 
these costs could include greater than expected installation and support costs or increased materials costs as a result of expedited changes 
the company may not be able to pass these costs on to its customers 
in addition  the company has experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulties in both low and high volume manufacturing 
any of these results could seriously harm the company s business 
for example  beginning late in the third quarter of fiscal  pri encountered manufacturing and supply chain problems relating to its turbostocker product  which pri had planned to begin manufacturing in high volume in response to increased customer demand at that time 
these problems delayed shipments and customer acceptance  which caused pri s revenues for fiscal and to be lower than expected and also contributed to its net losses for these periods 
from the time since pri discovered these problems through the end of fiscal it incurred expenditures of million to address them  consisting of approximately million for associated engineering costs  million of additional warranty costs  and million to repair or retrofit turbostockers already installed in the field where necessary 
these costs also contributed to pri s losses for these periods 
of these costs  the million reserve for repairs and retrofits was recorded as a special charge in the fourth quarter of pri s fiscal year the balance of the costs were recorded in pri s results of operations during the period beginning with the fourth quarter of its fiscal year and ending with the last quarter of its fiscal year pri also consolidated its turbostocker manufacturing operations into a single location  upgraded its enterprise resource planning system and outsourced additional manufacturing of components and subassemblies 
pri s and the company s efforts to date may be insufficient to resolve the manufacturing problems with the turbostocker  and the company may encounter similar difficulties and delays in the future 
moreover  on occasion the company has failed to meet its customers delivery or performance criteria  and as a result the company has deferred revenue recognition  incurred late delivery penalties and had higher warranty and service costs 
these failures could continue and could also cause the company to lose business from those customers and suffer long term damage to its reputation 
the company may have difficulty managing operations 
in september and december  the company announced restructuring programs to further reduce the company s cost structure 
the restructuring programs will include  among other things  a reduction in force of approximately employees  abandonment of certain product lines and information technology projects and the consolidation of certain facilities 
the company had also announced a restructuring program in september 
table of contents due in large part to the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry  this program was not successful in achieving its aim of aligning the company s operating costs with its expected revenues 
the company cannot guarantee that its more recently announced restructuring programs will be successful 
the reduction in force could result in a temporary reduction in productivity by the company s employees 
in addition  the company s future operating results will depend on the success of this restructuring program as well as on the company s overall ability to manage operations  which includes  among other things retaining and hiring  as required  the appropriate number of qualified employees  enhancing and expanding  as appropriate  the company s infrastructure  including but not limited to  the company s information systems and management team  accurately forecasting revenues  managing inventory levels to minimize excess and obsolete inventory  controlling expenses  managing the company s manufacturing capacity  real estate facilities and other assets  and executing on the company s plans 
an unexpected further decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expenses or a failure to manage other aspects of the company s operations could have a further material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company may be unable to retain necessary personnel because of intense competition for highly skilled personnel 
the company needs to retain a substantial number of employees with technical backgrounds for both its hardware and software engineering  manufacturing  sales and support staffs 
the market for these employees is very competitive  and the company has occasionally experienced delays in hiring qualified personnel 
due to the cyclical nature of the demand for its products and the current prolonged downturn in the semiconductor market  the company recently has reduced its workforce on several occasions as a cost reduction measure 
if the semiconductor market experiences an upturn  the company may need to rebuild its workforce 
due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which the company operates  this type of employment cycle increases the risk of being unable to retain and recruit key personnel 
the company s inability to recruit  retain and train adequate numbers of qualified personnel on a timely basis could adversely affect its ability to develop  manufacture  install and support its products and may result in lost revenue and market share if customers seek alternative solutions 
the company s international business operations expose it to a number of difficulties in coordinating its activities abroad and in dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
sales to customers outside north america accounted for approximately of brooks total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues 
many of the company s vendors are located in foreign countries 
as a result of its international business operations  the company is subject to various risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in many countries  difficulties in managing distributors  representatives and third party systems integrators  challenges presented by collecting trade accounts receivable in foreign jurisdictions  longer sales cycles  
table of contents possible adverse tax consequences  fewer legal protections for intellectual property  governmental currency controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings  changes in various regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  and export import controls and tariff regulations 
to support its international customers  the company maintains locations in several countries  including belgium  canada  china  france  germany  japan  malaysia  singapore  south korea  switzerland  taiwan and the united kingdom 
the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to manage these operations effectively 
nor can it guarantee that its investment in these international operations will enable it to compete successfully in international markets or to meet the service and support needs of its customers  some of whom are located in countries where the company has no infrastructure 
although the company s international sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates can make it more difficult for it to compete with foreign manufacturers on price 
if the company s international sales increase relative to its total revenues  these factors could have a more pronounced effect on the company s operating results 
in taiwan  the company s business could be impacted by the political  economic and military conditions in that country 
china does not recognize taiwan s independence and the two countries are continuously engaged in political disputes 
both countries have continued to conduct military exercises in or near the others territorial waters and airspace 
these disputes may continue or escalate  resulting in an economic embargo  a disruption in shipping or even military hostilities 
the political instability in taiwan could result in the creation of political or other non economic barriers to the company being able to sell its products or create local economic conditions that reduce demand for the company s products among the company s target markets 
in both taiwan and japan  the company s customers are subject to risk of natural disasters  which  if they were to occur  could harm the company s revenue 
semiconductor fabrication facilities have in the past experienced major reductions in foundry capacity due to earthquakes in taiwan and japan 
for example  in  taiwan experienced several earthquakes which impacted foundries due to power outages  physical damage and employee dislocation 
the company s business could suffer if a major customer s manufacturing capacity was adversely affected by a natural disaster such as an earthquake  fire  tornado or flood 
any kind of economic instability in taiwan and japan or other parts of asia where the company does business can have a severe negative impact on the company s operating results due to the large concentration of the company s sales activities in this region 
for example  during and  several asian countries  including taiwan and japan  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation  which negatively impacted the company s revenues and also negatively impacted the company s ability to collect payments from customers 
during this period  the lack of capital in the financial sectors of these countries made it difficult for the company s customers to open letters of credit or other financial instruments that are guaranteed by foreign banks 
the economic situation during this period exacerbated a decline in selling prices for the company s products as the company s competitors reduced product prices to generate needed cash 
the company must continually improve its technology to remain competitive 
technology changes rapidly in the semiconductor  data storage and flat panel display manufacturing industries 
the company believes its success depends in part upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and market new products to meet customer needs  even in industry downturns 
for example  as the semiconductor industry transitions from mm manufacturing technology to mm technology  the company believes it is important to its future success to develop and sell new products that are compatible with mm technology 
if competitors introduce new technologies or new products  the company s sales could decline and its existing products could lose market acceptance 
the company cannot guarantee that it 
table of contents will identify and adjust to changing market conditions or succeed in introducing commercially rewarding products or product enhancements 
the success of the company s product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurately identifying and defining new market opportunities and products  completing and introducing new product designs in a timely manner  market acceptance of the company s products and its customers products  timely and efficient software development  testing and process  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance in the field  development of a comprehensive  integrated product strategy  and efficient implementation and installation and technical support services 
because the company must commit resources to product development well in advance of sales  its product development decisions must anticipate technological advances by leading semiconductor manufacturers 
the company may not succeed in that effort 
its inability to select  develop  manufacture and market new products or enhance its existing products could cause it to lose its competitive position and could seriously harm its business 
the company faces significant competition which could result in decreased demand for the company s products or services 
the markets for the company s products are intensely competitive 
the company may be unable to compete successfully 
the company believes the primary competitive factors in the equipment automation segment are throughput  reliability  contamination control  accuracy and price performance 
the company believes that its primary competition in the equipment automation market is from integrated original equipment manufacturers that satisfy their semiconductor and flat panel display handling needs internally rather than by purchasing systems or modules from an independent supplier like the company 
many of these original equipment manufacturers have substantially greater resources than the company does 
applied materials  inc  the leading process equipment original equipment manufacturer  develops and manufactures its own central wafer handling systems and modules 
the company may not be successful in selling its products to original equipment manufacturers that internally satisfy their wafer or substrate handling needs  regardless of the performance or the price of the company products 
moreover  integrated original equipment manufacturers may begin to commercialize their handling capabilities and become the company s competitors 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors for factory interface products in the factory automation hardware segment are technical and technological capabilities  reliability  price performance  ease of integration and global sales and support capability 
in this market  the company competes directly with asyst  rorze  fortrend  newport  tdk  yasakawa and hirata 
some of these competitors have substantial financial resources and extensive engineering  manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
the company s automated material handling systems division in the factory automation hardware segment competes with daifuku  murata machiner  the asyst shinko electric joint venture and a number of other smaller foreign and domestic manufacturers of automated machinery used in semiconductor fabrication facilities 
the primary competitive factors in this market are quality  robustness and performance  price  ease of integration  vendor reputation  financial stability  support and on time delivery 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors in the end user semiconductor manufacturer market for factory automation software are product functionality  price performance  ease of use  ease of integration and installation  hardware and software platform compatibility  costs to support and maintain  vendor reputation and financial stability 
the relative importance of these competitive factors may change over 
table of contents time 
the company directly competes in this market with various competitors  including applied materials consilium  ibm  si view  hp compaq  trw  camstar and numerous small  independent software companies 
the company also competes with the in house software staffs of semiconductor manufacturers like nec  texas instruments and intel 
most of those manufacturers have substantially greater resources than the company does 
it is a normal incident of the purchasing process of most of the company s existing and potential customers to actively evaluate the product and service offerings of our competitors 
in some cases that process involves utilizing the products of competitors on a trial basis at the customer s site 
this is done to allow those customers to identify the product and service offerings that they judge to be of the highest quality and most suited to their needs 
customers also engage in such practices as part of a program to avoid dependence on sole source suppliers for certain of their needs 
the existence of such practices can make it more difficult for the company both to gain new customers and to win repeat business from existing customers 
new products developed by the company s competitors or more efficient production of their products could increase pricing pressure on our products 
in addition  companies in the semiconductor capital equipment industry have been facing pressure to reduce costs 
either of these factors may require the company to make significant price reductions to avoid losing orders 
further  the company s current and prospective customers continuously expert pressure on the company to lower prices  shorten delivery times and improve the capabilities of the company s products 
failure to respond adequately to such pressures could result in a loss of customers or orders 
much of the company s success and value lies in its ownership and use of intellectual property  and the company s failure to protect that property could adversely affect its future operations 
the company s ability to compete is heavily affected by its ability to protect its intellectual property 
the company relies primarily on trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  patents  copyrights  trademarks and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property 
the steps the company has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection 
the company s patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not fully protect the company s products 
this may make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
the company cannot guarantee that the steps the company has taken to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology 
other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating the company s proprietary rights 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in semiconductor related industries 
the company may engage in litigation to enforce its patents  protect its trade secrets or know how  defend itself against claims alleging it infringes the rights of others  or determine the scope and validity of the patents or intellectual property rights of others 
any litigation could result in substantial cost to the company and divert the attention of the company s management  which could harm its operating results and its future operations 
the company s operations could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
particular aspects of the company s technology could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights or patents of others 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to the company s business 
the company cannot predict the extent to which it may be required to seek licenses or alter its products so that they no longer infringe the rights of others 
the company cannot guarantee that the terms of any licenses it may be required to seek will be reasonable 
similarly  changing the company s products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others 
table of contents may be costly or impractical or could detract from the value of its products 
a party making a claim of infringement could secure a judgment against the company that requires it to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent the company from selling its products 
any claim of infringement by a third party also could cause the company to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract the attention of the company s management 
any of these events could seriously harm the company s business 
the company s business may be harmed by infringement claims of general signal or applied materials 
brooks received notice from general signal corporation general signal alleging certain of brooks tool automation products that the company sells to semiconductor process tool manufacturers infringed general signal s patent rights 
the notification advised brooks that general signal was attempting to enforce its rights to those patents in litigation against applied materials  and that  at the conclusion of that litigation  general signal intended to enforce its rights against brooks and others 
according to a press release issued by applied materials in november  applied materials settled its litigation with general signal by acquiring ownership of five general signal patents 
although not verified by the company  these five patents would appear to be the patents referred to by general signal in its prior notice to brooks 
applied materials has not contacted brooks regarding these patents 
the company cannot guarantee that it would prevail in any litigation by applied materials seeking damages or expenses from it or to enjoin it from selling its products on the basis of the alleged patent infringement  or that a license for any of the alleged infringed patents will be available to the company on reasonable terms  if at all 
a substantial portion of brooks revenues for fiscal derived from the products that are alleged to infringe 
the company s business may be harmed by infringement claims of asyst technologies  inc brooks acquired certain assets  including a transport system known as iridnet  from the infab division of jenoptik ag on september  asyst technologies  inc asyst had previously filed suit against jenoptik ag and other defendants  claiming that products of the defendants  including iridnet  infringe asyst s patents 
this ongoing litigation may ultimately affect certain products sold by the company 
the company has received notice that asyst may amend its complaint to name the company as an additional defendant 
based on the company s investigation of asyst s allegations  it does not believe it is infringing any claims of asyst s patents 
the company intends to continue to support jenoptik to argue vigorously  among other things  the position that the iridnet system does not infringe the asyst patents 
if asyst prevails in prosecuting its case  asyst may seek to prohibit the company from developing  marketing and using the iridnet product without a license 
because patent litigation can be extremely expensive  time consuming  and its outcome uncertain  the company may seek to obtain licenses to the disputed patents 
the company cannot guarantee that licenses will be available to it on reasonable terms  if at all 
if a license from asyst is not available  the company could be forced to incur substantial costs to reengineer the iridnet system  which could diminish its value 
in any case  the company may face litigation with asyst 
such litigation could be costly and would divert the company management s attention and resources 
in addition  even though sales of iridnet comprise a small percentage of the company s revenues  if the company does not prevail in such litigation  the company could be forced to pay significant damages or amounts in settlement 
jenoptik has agreed to indemnify the company for losses the company may incur in this action 
in addition  asyst made assertions in approximately that certain technology employed in products manufactured and sold by hermos informatik gmbh infringed one or more of asyst s patents 
hermos was acquired by the company in july see item  acquisitions 
to date asyst has taken no steps to assert or enforce any such rights against the company and  to the company s knowledge  asyst never commenced enforcement proceedings against hermos prior to its acquisition by the company 
should asyst seek to pursue any such claims against hermos or the company  the company would be subject to all of the business and litigation risks identified in the preceding paragraph 

table of contents the company s software products may contain errors or defects that could result in lost revenue  delayed or limited market acceptance or product liability claims with substantial litigation costs 
complex software products like the company s can contain errors or defects  particularly when the company first introduces new products or when it releases new versions or enhancements 
any defects or errors could result in lost revenue or a delay in market acceptance  which would seriously harm the company s business and operating results 
the company has occasionally discovered software errors in its new software products and new releases after their introduction  and the company expects that this will continue 
despite internal testing and testing by current and potential customers  the company s current and future products may contain serious defects 
because many of the company s customers use their products for business critical applications  any errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damage to the company s customers and could significantly impair their operations 
the company s customers could seek to recover damages from the company for losses related to any of these issues 
a product liability claim brought against the company  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend and could adversely affect the company s marketing efforts 
risk factors relating to the company s common stock the company s operating results fluctuate significantly  which could negatively impact its business and its stock price 
the company s revenues  margins and other operating results can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon a variety of factors  including the level of demand for semiconductors in general  cycles in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and automation software  the timing  rescheduling  cancellation and size of orders from the company s customer base  the company s ability to manufacture  test and deliver products in a timely and cost effective manner  the company s success in winning competitions for orders  the timing of the company s new product announcements and releases and those of its competitors  the mix of products it sells  the timing of any acquisitions and related costs  competitive pricing pressures  and the level of automation required in fab extensions  upgrades and new facilities 
a portion of the company s revenues from the factory automation software business depends on achieving project milestones 
as a result  the company s revenue from the factory automation software business is subject to fluctuations depending upon a number of factors  including the company s ability to achieve project milestones on a timely basis  if at all  as well as the timing and size of projects 
the company s stock price is volatile 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated widely 
for example  between april  and april   the closing price of brooks common stock rose from approximately to per share and between august  and september   the price of the brooks common stock dropped from approximately to per share 
consequently  the current market price of the company common stock may not be indicative of future market prices  and brooks may be unable to sustain 
table of contents or increase the value of an investment in its common stock 
factors affecting the company s stock price may include variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or the company s failure to meet analysts expectations  changes in the market price per share of the company s public company customers  market conditions in the industry  general economic conditions  low trading volume of the company common stock  and the number of firms making a market in the company common stock 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like the company 
these market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation  bylaws  contracts and convertible subordinated notes due may discourage takeover offers and may limit the price investors would be willing to pay for the company s common stock 
the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make an acquisition of the company more difficult and discourage changes in the company s management 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company has adopted a shareholder rights plan 
in many potential takeover situations  rights issued under the plan become exercisable to purchase the company common stock at a price substantially discounted from the then applicable market price of the company common stock 
because of its possible dilutive effect to a potential acquirer  the rights plan would generally discourage third parties from proposing a merger with or initiating a tender offer for the company that is not approved by the company s board of directors 
accordingly  the rights plan could have an adverse impact on the company s stockholders who might want to vote in favor of a merger or participate in a tender offer 
in addition  the company may issue shares of preferred stock upon terms the board of directors deems appropriate without stockholder approval 
the company s ability to issue preferred stock in such a manner could enable its board of directors to prevent changes in its management or control 
finally  upon a change of control of the company  the company may be required to repurchase convertible subordinated notes at a price equal to of the principal outstanding amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of the repurchase 
such a repurchase of the notes would represent a substantial cash outflow  accordingly  the repayment of the notes upon a change of control of the company could discourage third parties from proposing a merger with  initiating a tender offer for or otherwise attempting to gain control of the company 

table of contents brooks pri automation  inc item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure based on brooks overall interest exposure at september   including its fixed rate million convertible notes due in  a change in the effective interest rate percentage would not materially affect the consolidated results of operations or financial position 
currency rate exposure brooks foreign revenues are generally denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
the costs and expenses of brooks international subsidiaries are generally denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
however  since the functional currency of brooks international subsidiaries is the local currency  foreign currency translation adjustments do not impact operating results  but instead are reflected as a component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent brooks expands its international operations or changes its pricing practices to denominate prices in foreign currencies  brooks will be exposed to increased risk of currency fluctuation
