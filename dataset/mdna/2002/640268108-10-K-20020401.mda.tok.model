item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
inhale s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i of this annual report under the heading risk factors 
overview we are working to become the world s leading drug delivery company by providing a portfolio of technologies and expertise that will enable our pharmaceutical partners to improve drug performance throughout the drug development process 
we have been unprofitable since inception and expect to incur substantial and potentially increasing operating losses over at least the next few years as we expand our research and development efforts  testing activities and manufacturing operations  and as we further expand our late stage clinical and early commercial production facility 
to date  except for sales from three products using our advanced pegylation technology  we have not sold any commercial products and do not anticipate receiving material revenue from product sales or royalties in the near future 
for the period from inception through december   we incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
the sources of our working capital have been equity offerings and convertible debt financings  financings of equipment acquisitions and tenant improvements  interest earned on investments of cash  and revenues from short term research and feasibility agreements and development contracts 
to date we have been primarily dependent upon equity and convertible debt financings to fund our working capital 
we have generally been compensated for research and development expenses during initial feasibility work performed under collaborative arrangements 
in a typical collaboration  our partner will provide the drug  fund clinical and formulation development and market the resulting commercial product 
we will supply the drug delivery approach or drug formulation and receive revenues from drug compound manufacturing and other manufacturing activities  as well as royalties from sales of most commercial products 
in addition  for products using our inhance inhaleables technology  we expect to receive revenues from the supply of our device for the product along with any applicable drug processing 
partners that enter into collaborative agreements generally fund research and development through expense reimbursements and or payments as we achieve certain key development and regulatory milestones 
to achieve and sustain profitable operations  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and sell products using our drug delivery and other drug delivery systems 
there can be no assurance that we can generate sufficient product or contract research revenue to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
recent developments in january  we announced a strategic alliance with enzon that includes an agreement making inhale solely responsible for licensing enzon s peg patents  an option for enzon to license inhale s pegylation patents  an agreement to explore the development of non invasive delivery of single chain antibody products via the pulmonary route and settlement of a patent infringement litigation originally filed by enzon against shearwater 
as part of this broad alliance  we entered into a collaboration to develop three products using our inhance inhaleables technology and or seds technology 
under the terms of this collaboration  we will be responsible for the development of drug formulations for the agreed upon pharmaceutical agents as well as clinical and commercial manufacturing of the drug formulation and device combination 
enzon will be responsible for the clinical development and worldwide commercialization of the system 
inhale will receive research and development funding  milestone payments as the program progresses through further clinical testing  and royalty payments once the product is commercialized 
as part of this alliance  enzon made a million investment in our preferred stock 
in january  biogen announced that it does not plan to further develop inhaleable avonex for multiple sclerosis at this time  but is working with us to evaluate other potential indications for the inhaled formulation or other opportunities for collaboration 
in october  lilly notified us that the fort o development program that was reinitiated in september  will not be funded in lilly further informed us that other than on going stability work  additional activities with respect to the program would be suspended 
in june  our board of directors adopted a preferred share purchase rights plan the plan  commonly known as a poison pill 
the plan and provisions of the delaware general corporation law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage  delay or prevent a third party from removing our management 
further  they may discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities  initiating a tender offer or proxy contest or acquiring us  even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over then current market prices 
terms of the plan provide for a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right a right for each outstanding share of common stock  par value 
per share the common shares  of the company 
the dividend is payable on june  the record date to the stockholders of record on that date 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company one one hundredth of a share of series a junior participating preferred stock  par value 
per share the preferred shares  at a price of per one one hundredth of a preferred share the purchase price  subject to adjustment 
each one one hundredth of a share of preferred shares has designations and powers  preferences and rights  and the qualifications  limitations and restrictions which make its value approximately equal to the value of a common share 
initially  the rights will be evidenced by the stock certificates representing the common shares then outstanding  and no separate right certificates  as defined  will be distributed 
until the earlier to occur of i the date of a public announcement that a person  entity or group of affiliated or associated persons have acquired beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding common shares an acquiring person or ii business days or such later date as may be determined by action of the board of directors prior to such time as any person or entity becomes an acquiring person following the commencement of  or announcement of an intention to commence  a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in any person or entity becoming an acquiring person the earlier of such dates being called the distribution date  the rights will be evidenced  with respect to any of the common share certificates outstanding as of the record date  by such common share certificate 
until the distribution date  the rights are not exercisable and will be transferable with and only with the common shares 
the rights will expire on june  the final expiration date  unless the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the company 
in june  we entered into an agreement to acquire shearwater in which cash was paid in the amount of approximately million and  shares of common stock were to be issued to the holders of all the outstanding common stock of shearwater in consideration for the acquisition of shearwater through its merger with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of inhale 
we issued these shares in a private placement exempt from registration under section of the securities act of  pursuant to regulation d promulgated under the act 
for each share of shearwater common stock  we issued approximately new shares of our common stock and paid shearwater stockholders cash in the amount of per share 
in addition  we assumed all of the outstanding options to acquire shearwater common stock which were converted into options to acquire approximately  shares of our common stock and the holders thereof were also paid in cash an aggregate amount of million at closing 
each outstanding option to purchase shearwater common stock was converted into the right to receive approximately shares of our common stock upon exercise and option holders were paid cash in the amount of per share of shearwater common stock issuable upon exercise of such options 
no fractional shares of our common stock were issued in connection with the acquisition 
in lieu thereof  any holder of shearwater common stock was paid cash based on the value of such fractional share 
our acquisition of shearwater also expanded our development pipeline 
on february   shearwater entered into a manufacturing agreement with schering plough corporation in connection with the peg reagent used in peg intron peg interferon alpha for use in the treatment of the hepatitis c virus 
under the terms of this agreement  we manufacture the peg reagent and schering plough holds an exclusive worldwide license to peg intron  the first and only pegylated interferon product approved for marketing in the united states and worldwide 
shearwater also entered into a license  manufacturing and supply agreement with f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
roche whereby roche received a licensed to the peg reagent used in roche s pegasys product  a pegylated interferon alpha a product  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
this agreement provides us with milestone payments  rights to manufacture the peg reagent and a share of future revenues related to the pegasys product 
on april   shearwater entered into a subsequent agreement with roche related to further collaborative work on pegasys 
pegasys was filed for approval with the fda for a hepatitis c indication on may  in january  we issued  shares of our common stock to the holders of all of the existing issued ordinary share capital of bradford particle design 
we issued these shares in consideration for the acquisition of the outstanding share capital of bradford particle design in a private placement exempt from registration under section of the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to regulation d and regulation s promulgated under the act 
for each share of bradford particle design s common stock  we issued new shares of our common stock and paid approximately cash  for an aggregate cash payment of approximately million 
in addition  we assumed all outstanding options to acquire bradford particle design common shares that converted into options to acquire  shares of our common stock 
in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which are convertible at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock 
the october notes were sold only in the united states to certain qualified institutional buyers under an exemption from registration provided by rule a of the act 
the october notes will mature in and are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which are convertible at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock 
the february notes were sold only in the united states to certain qualified institutional buyers under an exemption from registration provided by rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
the february notes mature in and are convertible at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
in october and november we entered into privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of these outstanding february notes to convert their notes into shares of our common stock in exchange for a cash payment made by us 
to date  we have made cash payments of approximately million in the aggregate in connection with agreements that provide for the conversion of approximately million principal amount of outstanding february notes into approximately million shares of our common stock 
in february  we entered into privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures sold in october and november  providing for the conversion of approximately million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debentures into approximately million shares of common stock for net payments of approximately million 
in november  pfizer and aventis announced that they entered into a worldwide agreement to manufacture insulin and to co develop and co promote inhaleable insulin 
we continue to have responsibility for manufacturing powders and supplying delivery devices in connection with this arrangement and will receive a royalty on inhaleable insulin products marketed jointly by pfizer and aventis behring 
pfizer commenced dosing for its phase iii clinical trials on this program in june  and completed these trials in april in december  pfizer announced that it had decided to include an increased level of controlled  long term safety data in its proposed nda with respect to inhaled insulin and that it expected to complete this additional study in critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
it requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  business combinations and accrued liabilities to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations revenue recognition contract revenue from collaborative research agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through collaborative development are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continued involvement 
revenue from grants and feasibility arrangements are recognized as the related costs are incurred 
our research revenue is derived primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical industry and consists of reimbursement of development costs  reimbursement of certain expenses  payment of clinical supplies and amortization of milestones 
payments received for milestones achieved are deferred and recorded as revenue over the next period of continued development 
revenue from product sales is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonable assured 
allowances  if any  are established for estimated product returns and discounts 
because we have only recently begun selling a limited number of products through the acquisition of our subsidiaries  we do not have substantial experience in establishing allowances for returns and discounts 
business combinations purchased in process research and development ipr d ipr d expense is determined based on an analysis using risk adjusted cash flows expected to be generated by products that may result from in process technologies purchased in connection with acquisitions or business combinations 
this analysis includes forecasting future cash flows that are expected to result from the progress made on each in process project prior to the purchase dates 
cash flows are estimated by first forecasting  on a product by product basis  net revenues expected from the sales of the first generation of each in process project and risk adjusting these revenues to reflect the probability of advancing to the next stage of the fda approval process 
the forecast data in the analysis is based on internal product level forecast information maintained by management in the ordinary course of managing the business 
the inputs used by management in analyzing ipr d is based on assumptions  which management believes to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
appropriate operating expenses are deducted from forecasted net revenues or on a product by product basis to establish a forecast of net returns on the completed portion of the in process technology 
finally  net returns are discounted to a present value using discount rates that incorporate the weighted average cost of capital relative to the biotech industry and our company as well as product specific risks associated with the purchased in process research and development products 
the product specific risk factors include the products phase of development  type of molecule under development  likelihood of regulatory approval  manufacturing process capability  scientific rationale  preclinical safety and efficacy data  target product profile  and development plan 
in addition to the product specific risk factors  a discount rate is used for the purchase valuation  which represents a considerable risk premium to our weighted average cost of capital 
the valuations used to estimate ipr d require us to use significant estimates and assumptions  that if changed  may result in a different valuation for ipr d 
valuations for our acquisitions were completed by independent third party consulting firms in accordance with sec guidelines and reviewed with our external audit firm 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets were amortized on a straight line basis through december  in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two statements as a result of its deliberations on the business combinations project statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on business combinations and sfas on goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas will be effective for any business combinations initiated after june  and also includes the criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will require that goodwill not be amortized  but rather be subject to an impairment test at least annually 
separately identified and recognized intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed before july  that do not meet the new criteria for separate recognition of intangible assets will be subsumed into goodwill upon adoption 
in addition  the useful lives of recognized intangible assets acquired in transactions completed before july  will be reassessed and the remaining amortization periods adjusted accordingly 
effective january   consistent with the new business combination accounting rules  assembled workforce will be reclassified as goodwill and will be subject to an impairment assessment 
application of the nonamortization provisions of statement is expected to result in a reduction in net loss of million per share based upon shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share in in we periodically evaluate whether changes have occurred that would require revision of the remaining estimated useful life of these assets or otherwise render the assets unrecoverable 
if such an event occurred  we would determine whether the goodwill or intangibles are impaired 
to date  no such impairment losses have been recorded 
accrued liabilities certain accrued liabilities reflect management s best estimates based on our specific historical experience and understanding of industry practice 
we record a reserve for these matters when an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the potential liability is reasonably estimable 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue increased in from levels and in from levels 
allowances  if any  are established for estimated product returns and discounts 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december   as compared to december   and the increase in revenue for the year ended december   as compared to december   were both primarily due to expansion of our existing collaborative agreement with pfizer and revenues from our newly acquired subsidiaries in pfizer represented approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  product sales through our shearwater subsidiary accounted for of revenues in contract research revenue for  and also included reimbursed research and development expenses as well as the amortization of deferred up front signing and progress payments received from our collaborative partners 
contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year  and future contract revenues cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract revenues depends in part upon future success in obtaining new collaborative agreements  timely completion of feasibility studies  the continuation of existing collaborations and achievement of milestones under current and future agreements 
product sales are dependent upon regulatory approval of new products for sale and adoption of current products in the market and cannot be accurately predicted 
cost of goods sold is associated with product sales and was million for the year ended december  due to the inclusion of shearwater s financial results since the date of acquisition 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was primarily attributed to increased spending related to the development effort for both partner and internally funded programs  the scale up of technologies and the continuing development of global manufacturing capabilities for both inhalation devices and drug powders in order to support inhaleable insulin clinical trials and preparation for commercial production  as well as the addition of shearwater and bradford particle design to our operations through acquisitions during the increase in research and development expenses in from was due to increased spending related to the scale up of technologies for current partnered projects  the continuing development of our global manufacturing operations in order to support phase iii inhaleable insulin clinical trials and commercial production  increased investment in internally funded research and development projects for next generation products and non cash compensation associated with stock options 
we expect research  development and process development spending to increase over the next few years as we continue to expand our development efforts under collaborative agreements using our expanded technology portfolio and to scale up our commercial manufacturing facility 
our research and development activities can be divided into research and preclinical programs  clinical development programs and commercial readiness 
we estimate the costs associated with research and preclinical programs  clinical development programs and commercial readiness over the past three years at the following in thousands research and preclinical programs    clinical development programs    commercial readiness    total research and development    general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in from was due primarily to increased support associated with our manufacturing and development efforts  including administrative staffing  business development and marketing  as well the addition of shearwater and bradford particle design to our operations through acquisitions during the increase in general and administrative expenses in from was due primarily to a non cash compensation charge associated with stock options and the costs associated with supporting our increased manufacturing and development efforts  including administrative staffing and business development activities 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was associated with the acquisition of bradford particle design ltd 
and shearwater corporation during due to the adoption of new accounting standards with respect to business combinations  goodwill and certain other intangible assets will no longer be amortized and will be subject to an impairment test at least annually beginning january  this is expected to result in a reduction in amortization expense of million per share based upon the shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share in 
the useful lives of recognized intangible assets acquired in transactions will regularly be reassessed and the remaining amortization periods adjusted accordingly 
other income expense  net  was million of expense for the year ended december  as compared to million of income for the year ended december  in  our equity investment in alliance was determined to be impaired and a loss of million was recorded 
in  we recorded a gain of million associated with the sale of our alliance shares 
there was no debt conversion premium  net  recorded for the year ended december  and december  for the year ended december   million was recorded associated with the conversion of our october convertible subordinated debentures and february convertible subordinated notes 
interest income was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in interest income in from and the million increase in interest income in from were primarily due to our maintaining larger cash and investment balances  including the proceeds of our issuance of several offerings of convertible subordinated notes and debentures and higher interest rates 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in interest expense in from primarily relates to the full year s interest expense for the convertible subordinated notes issued in october and the full year s interest expense associated with our build to suit lease in the million increase in interest expense in from primarily relates to interest paid on the various convertible subordinated notes and debentures issued 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
these carryforwards will expire beginning in the year utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided for by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
purchased in process research and development ipr d ipr d represents that portion of the purchase price of an acquisition related to the research and development activities which i have not demonstrated their technological feasibility  and ii have no alternative future uses 
during the year ended december  our acquisitions of bradford particle design and shearwater have resulted in an aggregate total charge to ipr d of approximately million 
in june  we completed the acquisition of shearwater in exchange for our payment of approximately million and million shares of common stock to the holders of all the outstanding common stock of shearwater 
in addition  we assumed all of the outstanding options to acquire shearwater common stock which was converted into options to acquire approximately  shares of our common stock and the holders thereof were also paid an aggregate amount of million in cash at closing 
of the total purchase consideration of million  million was allocated to the assets acquired based on their fair value on the date of acquisition  including million in goodwill and other intangible assets 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d  which was determined to have no alternative future use and was charged as an expense during the three month period ended june  in january  we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of bradford particle design in exchange for approximately million in newly issued shares of our common stock and approximately million in cash 
of the total purchase consideration of million  million was allocated to the assets acquired based on their fair value on the date of acquisition  including million in goodwill and other intangible assets 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d  which was determined to have no alternative future use and was charged as an expense in the quarter ended march  the amounts of ipr d were determined based on an analysis using risk adjusted cash flows expected to be generated by the products that may result from the in process platform technology for bradford particle design and from the in process technology for shearwater 
the analysis included forecasted future cash flows that were expected to result from the progress made on each of the in process projects prior to the purchase dates 
these cash flows were estimated by first forecasting  on a product by product basis  net revenues expected from the sales of the first generation of each in process project and risk adjusted to reflect the probability of advancing to the next stage of the fda approval process 
appropriate operating expenses were deducted from the total forecasted net revenues for bradford particle design and on a product by product basis from the forecast for shearwater to establish a forecast of net returns on the completed portion of the in process technology 
finally  these net returns were discounted to a present value using discount rates that incorporate the weighted average cost of capital relative to the biotech industry and our company as well as product specific risks associated with the purchased in process research and development products 
the product specific risk factors included the products phase of development  type of molecule under development  likelihood of regulatory approval  manufacturing process capability  scientific rationale  preclinical safety and efficacy data  target product profile  and development plan 
in addition to the product specific risk factors  an overall discount rate of for bradford particle design and for shearwater was used for the purchase valuation  which represents a considerable risk premium to our weighted average cost of capital 
the forecast data in the analysis was based on internal product level forecast information maintained by inhale s management in the ordinary course of managing the business 
the inputs used by management in analyzing in process research and development was based on assumptions  which management believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge for acquired in process research and development costs 
the acquisition was recorded as a purchase and million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d and charged as an expense in the quarter ended june  as of the date of the acquisition  the in process technology had no alternative future use and did not qualify for capitalization 
in november  we concluded an agreement with alliance pharmaceutical corp 
to acquire alliance s pulmosphere particle and particle processing technology for use in respiratory drug delivery 
under the terms of the agreement  we received the rights to the pulmosphere technology  other related assets including research materials  laboratory records  and certain equipment that had been used in the development of pulmosphere technology and the manufacturing and testing of particles using such pulmosphere technology  and alliance stock valued at million in exchange for million in cash and million of our stock 
additionally  we incurred approximately  of acquired costs  which were included in the total purchase consideration 
alliance also has the right to additional substantial payments upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on a defined number of products commercialized using the technology 
of the total purchase consideration  million was allocated to assets acquired based on their fair value on the date of acquisition 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d and was charged as an expense in the year ended december  in  our equity investment in alliance was determined to be impaired and a loss on investment of million was recorded 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our debt and equity securities  revenues from development contracts and short term research and feasibility agreements  financing of equipment acquisitions and tenant improvements  and interest income earned on our investments of cash 
we do not utilize off balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
our operations used cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts differed from our net operating losses in these periods principally due to depreciation expense and purchased ipr d and net debt conversion premium 
we recorded a million  million and million of purchased ipr d charges for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in october  we entered into a financing arrangement with a real estate partnership to complete construction of existing office facilities and provide financing for future capital improvements of up to million 
as a result of our continuing involvement and significant influence in the real estate partnership  and other provisions in the leasing transactions  the facility costs and capital lease obligations of the real estate partnership are recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we purchased property and equipment of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the current year activity includes million associated with our capital lease obligation with our build to suit lease facility 
the decrease in purchased property and equipment in as compared to  reflects completion of the first phase of construction of a new san carlos lab and office facility  offset by continued investment in our commercial manufacturing facilities  including device manufacturing at third party contract manufacturers  and expansion of our san carlos powder processing facilities 
also  in connection with our acquisition of bradford particle design  we paid net cash of million  which represents cash paid to bradford particle design shareholders of million  net of bradford particle design s cash balance of million 
the remainder of the bradford particle design acquisition was non cash in nature 
in connection with our acquisition of shearwater  we paid net cash of million  which represents cash paid to shearwater shareholders of million  net of shearwater s cash obtained at june  of million 
see purchased in process research and development 
in october  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of convertible subordinated debentures 
in february and october  we received approximately million and million  respectively  in net proceeds from the sale of convertible subordinated notes 
this includes net payments of approximately million and million in connection with agreements that provide for the conversion of approximately million and million of our october and february debentures  respectively  into common stock 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years after years tenant improvement loan    build to suit lease      interest payable     operating leases      principal amount of convertible subordinated notes and debentures other obligations total contractual cash obligations    in august  we entered into supply agreements with two contract manufacturers to provide for the manufacturing of our inhalation device 
under the terms of the agreements  we may be obligated to reimburse both parties for the actual unamortized and unrecovered portion of any equipment procured or facilities established and the interest accrued for their capital overlay in the event that inhaleable insulin does not gain fda approval to the extent that the contract manufacturers cannot re deploy the assets 
at the present time  it is not possible to estimate the loss that will occur should inhaleable insulin not be approved 
we expect our cash requirements to continue to grow at an accelerated rate due to expected increases in costs associated with further research and development of our technologies  development of drug formulations  process development for the manufacture and filling of powders and devices  marketing and general and administrative costs and starting up commercial operations 
these expenses include  but are not limited to  increases in personnel and personnel related costs  purchases of capital equipment  investments in technologies  inhalation device prototype construction and facilities expansion 
our planned facilities expansion includes the completion of our commercial manufacturing facility and the scale up of device manufacturing with our third party contract manufacturers 
given our current cash requirements  we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our operating expense requirements for the next months 
we plan to continue to invest in our growth and the need for cash will be dependent upon the timing of these investments 
our capital needs will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our research and development arrangements  progress with preclinical and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of developing and the rate of scale up of our powder processing and packaging technologies  the timing and cost of our late stage clinical and early commercial production facility  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the need to acquire licenses to new technologies and the status of competitive products 
to satisfy our long term needs  we intend to seek additional funding  as necessary  from corporate partners and from the sale of securities 
because we are an early stage biotechnology company  we do not qualify to issue investment grade debt or have access to certain credit facilities 
as a result  any financing we undertake will likely involve the issuance of equity  convertible debt instruments or high yield debt to fund our working capital 
to date we have been primarily dependent upon equity and convertible debt financings for capital and have incurred substantial debt as a result of our issuances of subordinated notes and debentures convertible into our common stock 
our substantial debt  the market price of our securities and the general economic climate  among other factors  could have material consequences for the company s financial position and could affect our sources of short term and long term funding 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  the potential change noted above is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  increases in interest rates could adversely affect the fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes and debentures  which pay a fixed rate of interest 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding convertible subordinated notes and debentures with a fair market value of approximately million
