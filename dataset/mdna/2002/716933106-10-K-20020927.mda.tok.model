actual results could differ materially from any future performance suggested in this report as a result of the factors  including those discussed in risk factors  elsewhere in this report 
overview pharmacyclics is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development of products that improve existing therapeutic approaches to cancer and atherosclerosis 
to date we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of our products and have not derived any commercial revenues from the sale of our products 
we have two primary drug products  or research and development programs  for which we are currently focusing our efforts xcytrin and antrin 
in december  we announced the top line results of our phase iii clinical trial of xcytrin injection to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy of tumors that have spread to the brain resulting from a variety of cancers such as lung and breast or brain metastases 
we did not reach statistical significance for either of the trial s endpoints  survival or time to neurologic progression 
however  additional analysis of the data indicated that brain metastases patients with lung cancer who received xcytrin demonstrated significant improvement in time to neurologic progression 
based on our discussions with the fda  we believe the best course of action is to conduct a confirmatory trial in brain metastases patients with lung cancer  the most common cause of brain metastases 
this confirmatory trial is expected to start in the fourth quarter of calendar we have completed patient enrollment in a multicenter phase ii trial with xcytrin for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme  a malignant primary brain tumor 
we also have begun enrollment in a phase i clinical trials for head and neck cancer and the use of xcytrin with chemotherapy 
through our cooperative research and development agreement  the national cancer institute is conducting phase i trials of xcytrin for treatment of both primary adult and pediatric brain tumors  pancreatic cancer and lung cancer 
we completed enrollment of a randomized phase ii clinical trial with antrin for patients with peripheral arterial disease of the lower extremities 
the study is designed to evaluate both prevention of restenosis following balloon angioplasty and primary treatment of atherosclerosis 
patients have been enrolled in this study and are being evaluated with follow up angiograms 
we also completed enrollment of a phase i clinical trial with antrin for the treatment of coronary artery disease in patients receiving balloon angioplasty and stents 
this study is primarily designed to evaluate the safety of various doses of drug and light 
patients are receiving follow up angiograms six months after treatment to evaluate effects of the treatment on the blood vessels 
in september  we reported interim results of this trial at the european society of cardiology and the transcatheter cardiovascular therapeutics meetings  which indicate that antrin phototherapy is safe and feasible to perform in the coronary arteries 
we currently plan to establish a corporate alliance for antrin before performing any additional clinical development 
we have initially studied lutrin for photodynamic therapy of patients with invasive surface cancers that are accessible to externally applied light  such as recurrent breast cancer to the chest wall 
the national cancer institute is sponsoring phase i studies of lutrin for treatment of cancer of the prostate and cervix 
we plan to continue to supply drug and light devices for the national cancer institute studies of lutrin but do not plan to conduct any additional clinical studies ourselves 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in  and as of june   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses until the commercialization of our products generates sufficient revenues to cover our expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our achieving profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our products under development  and obtain required regulatory clearances and successfully manufacture and market our products 
see risk factors all of our product candidates are in development and we cannot be certain that any of our products under development will be commercialized  acceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve market acceptance will harm our business  we have a history of operating losses and we expect to continue to have losses in the future  failure to obtain product approvals or comply with ongoing governmental regulations could adversely affect our business and our capital requirements are uncertain and we may have difficulty raising needed capital in the future 
results of operations comparison of years ended june   and revenues 
our revenues for the years ended june   and were nil   and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended june  resulted primarily from a non recurring fee paid by nycomed to terminate their collaboration agreement to sell and market lutrin outside the united states  canada and japan and contract revenue received from nycomed prior to the termination of the agreement 
revenues for the year ended june  resulted from a milestone payment from alcon and contract revenue from nycomed 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the  decrease from to was primarily due to decreased expenses with our antrin and lutrin programs 
the  increase in fiscal from fiscal was the result of increased expense associated with our xcytrin program and the impact of recognizing a credit of  in fiscal associated with the termination of our manufacturing and supply agreement with celanese ltd 
research and development expenses are comprised of direct and indirect costs 
direct costs consist of personnel costs directly associated with a program  preclinical study costs  clinical trial costs  and related clinical drug and device development and manufacturing costs  drug formulation costs  contract services and other research expenditures 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs not directly associated with a program  overhead and facility costs and other support service expenses 
research and development costs are identified as either directly attributed to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
prior to  we did not track our historical research and development costs by specific program 
for this reason we cannot accurately estimate our total historical costs on a specific program basis 
direct costs by program and indirect costs are as follows program direct costs xcytrin    antrin    lutrin    total direct costs    indirect costs    total research and development costs    xcytrin xcytrin direct costs were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease of  in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower clinical trial costs  as our phase iii trial was completed in fiscal and lower drug manufacturing costs  due to the timing of the manufacturing of xcytrin 
it is our policy to expense all costs related to the manufacturing of our drug products when incurred until commercial viability of such products have been demonstrated and the necessary regulatory approvals are received 
these decreases were partially offset by the increase in employee costs  as we increased staffing to support the potential regulatory filings related to our phase iii clinical trial of xcytrin 
the increase of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher personnel  and consulting costs  to support our on going phase iii trial 
antrin antrin direct costs were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease of  in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to focusing our resources on our xcytrin product 
this resulted in lower pre clinical studies costs  lower employee costs  and lower device expenditures 
antrin direct costs were also affected by lower drug manufacturing costs 
the increase in fiscal of  as compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher third party clinical trial costs  due to higher clinical trial activity  higher personnel costs  to support these trials  as well as higher pre clinical studies 
these costs were partially offset by lower device costs  and lower third party research expenses 
lutrin lutrin direct costs were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease of  in fiscal was primarily due to focusing our resources on our xcytrin product 
the change in focus resulted in lower employee  and pre clinical studies costs 
lutrin was also affected by lower drug manufacturing costs  due to the timing of the manufacture of lutrin 
lutrin direct costs remained relatively consistent in fiscal as compared to fiscal indirect costs indirect costs were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increase of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in facility and it support costs  to support the growth in personnel and higher employee costs  as we increased headcount to support our research and development efforts  partially offset by lower consulting costs 
the increase of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to recognizing a credit of  in fiscal associated with the termination of our manufacturing development and supply agreement with celanese  ltd 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the years ended june    and were   and  respectively 
the  increase in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from higher personnel costs  and higher facilities and it support costs  to support expected increases in operations 
the  increase in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from higher personnel costs related to increased headcount to support greater clinical development activities  and increased marketing efforts to promote awareness of the company s products interest and other  net 
interest and other  net  was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to lower interest rates being earned on reduced balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the increase in fiscal was primarily the result of interest earned on higher average cash balances from sales of common stock in the third quarter of fiscal our cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of fixed rate instruments 
income taxes 
at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through as a result of ownership changes that have occurred in the past  we believe that utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations 
a full valuation allowance has been established for the company s deferred tax assets since realization of such assets through the generation of future taxable income is uncertain 
see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of working capital have been private and public equity financings and proceeds from collaborative research and development agreements  as well as grant and contract revenues and interest income 
since inception  we have used approximately  of cash for operating activities and approximately  of cash for the purchase of laboratory and office equipment and payments under capital lease agreements 
as of june   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively  and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and prepaid expenses and other assets 
net cash provided by investing activities of  and  in the years ended june  and  respectively  consisted primarily of proceeds of maturities and sales of marketable securities  net of purchases of marketable securities  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was  in the year ended june  and consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment  partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities 
in march  we sold  shares of our common stock through a private placement at a price of per share resulting in net cash proceeds to us of approximately  in september and october  we sold a total of  shares of our common stock at per share resulting in net cash proceeds to us of approximately  the company leases its facilities under non cancelable operating leases that expire in fiscal future minimum lease payments and sublease income under non cancelable operating leases as of june  are as follows operating operating lease sublease commitments income fiscal   fiscal  total minimum lease payments and operating lease income   based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least calendar year however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the status of product development  the time and cost involved in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market and distribute our products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot be certain that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk factors risks related to pharmacyclics our capital requirements are uncertain and we may have difficulty raising capital in the future 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined by the sec as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
license and milestone fees are recognized as revenue when earned over the period of the arrangement  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of any on going obligation 
contract revenue is recognized as earned  primarily based on costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion  pursuant to the terms of each agreement 
license  milestone  contract and grant revenues are not subject to repayment 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
at june   these investment securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
management assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the following factors length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of june  would have potentially declined by  one of our cancelable drug supply agreements is denominated in a foreign currency 
we have not entered into any agreements or transactions to hedge the risk associated with potential fluctuations in currencies  accordingly  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk related to this contract 
while we may enter into hedge or other agreements in the future to actively manage this risk  we do not believe this risk is material to our financial statements
