future operations the financial statements of the company have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as shown in the financial statements  the company has experienced increasing net losses before income taxes of approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
in addition  the company has experienced significant declines in operating revenues and cash reserves over the past few years 
the company also has a working capital deficit of approximately million  which includes approximately million in current debt obligations coming due in fiscal year as of october  the company has not made its september debt payments 
although the company is currently attempting to renegotiate terms that are more favorable to the company  there is no guarantee that management will be successful 
these factors  among others  raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependant upon its ability to significantly improve its operating ratios  its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis  the support of its stockholders and its ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing as may be required 
the company is currently implementing a plan  which management believes will significantly improve its operating efficiencies over the next fiscal year

the company is negotiating with its lenders and some of its vendors to extend the terms of certain obligations in order to improve the company s financial position in the near term and has identified cost cutting measures to eliminate unnecessary overhead 
future plans will include an increased emphasis on identifying and targeting those lanes which are profitable for the company and to eliminating those lanes which do not fit the company s marketing philosophy 
the company has also identified certain unencumbered assets for disposition 
these assets include real estate  an airplane  and other miscellaneous assets 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to improve its operating ratios or that the company will be successful in securing capital resources to fund maturities of debt and other obligations as they become due in fiscal or to support the company until such time that the company is able to consistently generate results sufficient to support its operations 
inflation inflation continues to have a minimal impact on operations 
seasonality in the trucking industry  results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern because customers reduce shipments during the winter 
historically  the company s operating efficiency has decreased during the winter months due to increased maintenance costs  reduced fuel efficiency  detours and delays for weather
